	<p>Black Hat, is pleased to offer a Tool/Demo area for independent researchers and the open source community that will allow you to showcase your work. The concept is simple: We will be providing kiosks complete with monitor, power, wired internet access and you will bring your machine to showcase your work and answer questions from delegates attending Black Hat. Spaces will be limited to showcase unique tools/demos over the course of the Briefings.</p>

<h2>DUST: your RSS feed belongs to you</h2>
<p>Law around the world is trying to control what is published on the Internet. After wikeleaks case and HBGary ownage everybody could see how there are many controls that can be used to close a website, a domain name and to cut the communication between the source and the audience. What happened if someone wants to close your blog? Could you send any message to your audience? In this talk we provide you a new way to publish your RSS feeds using P2P networks as a failover system. Dust is "only" a Reader but could manage P2P Feeds, multiples http feeds from the same source, and the most important feature, can migrate from one feed to multiple ones without any effort for all your readers.

<h2>ModSecurity Demonstration Pages / ModSecurity Smoketest page -  / ModSecurity Javascript Sandbox
</h2>
<h4>ModSecurity Smoketest Page</h4>

<p>The ModSecurity Demo is a joint effort between the ModSecurity and PHPIDS project teams to allow users to test ModSecurity and PHPIDS. Any data is sent to a ModSecurity install for inspection by the CRS and then it will be proxied to the PHPIDS page for normal inspection and processing. The response body will then be inspected to confirm if there are any evasion issues between the CRS and PHPIDS.</p>

<p>Demo Challenge</p>
<p>Your challenge is to try and bypass the attack detection mechanisms of ModSecurity and the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS).</p>

<h4>ModSecurity Javascript Sandbox</h4>

<p>The purpose of this demo is to show possible XSS defenses by using ModSecrity's Content Injection capability to insert defensive Javascript to the beginning of html responses. This demo uses Eduardo (sirdarckcat) Vela's Active Content Signatures (ACS) code.</p>

<p>Read more about this concept <a href="http://blog.modsecurity.org/2010/09/advanced-topic-of-the-week-xss-defense-via-content-injection.html" target="_blank">http://blog.modsecurity.org/2010/09/advanced-topic-of-the-week-xss-defense-via-content-injection.html.</a></p>

<p>Demo Challenge</p>
<p>Your challenge is to try and bypass the ACS content injection and successfully execute a reflected XSS attack that executes JS code in your browser. You may toggle On/Off the XSS Content Injection Defense by checking the box in the form below. This will help to facilitate testing of working XSS payloads.</p>

<h3><a name="Case"></a>Andrew Case</h3>
<h2>Registry Decoder</h2>
<p>The registry on all Microsoft Windows operating systems contains a wealth of forensically interesting information, including a history of attached devices, a list of user accounts, URLs typed into local web browsers, information about network shares and much more. Unfortunately, existing tools for process sing the Windows registry are difficult to use and leave the investigator with many complex, manual tasks. Not only does this lead to human error and waste a substantial amount of time during investigations, it also leads to missed evidence due to investigator inexperience. For investigators who are not constantly trained or self-taught, the ever changing format of the registry, meaning of keys, and value of information contained is simply lost.</p>
<p>To combat these issues, we developed Registry Decoder, a point and click tool that collects and analyzes the Windows registry files from forensic targets and prepares a readable report for the investigator. This tool contains two applications, the first is used for traditional "dead" forensics against hard drive images and the second is used for "live" (triage) analysis of running machines. Registry Decoder is easily customizable and provides an interface for investigators to quickly identify what information is most crucial for their cases, extract that data and render it into a report format. Additional information is provided to give the investigator practical insight into the meaning and relevance of the data collected. Registry Decoder can also be used to examine values in the current Windows registry alongside copies of the registry stored by the system restore point facility to cross-reference this information and help reconstruct a historical background of the system under investigation. Registry Decoder also creates visualizations of a number of types of relevant information in order to help investigators to quickly understand the data, as well as for presentation of evidence to non-technical peers.</p>

<h2>Secure Open Wireless Demo</h2>
<p>We'll be demoing our GPLv2 proof of concept code for Secure Open Wireless, which we're releasing at Blackhat. Today, 802.11 wireless networks are either unencrypted or they require authentication. We're demonstrating a third way which uses an anonymous form of EAP-TLS to create an encrypted wireless connection without a pre-shared password. Users are protected from rogue access points with an SSL certificate tied to the SSID of the access point. In our approach, certified SSIDs would have to be globally unique identifiers. Domain names could be used for this purpose. An SSH style trust on first use fall back mechanism can protect connections to networks that are too small to protect with a commercial certificate authority.</p>

RAFT attempts to bridge this gap by providing response analysis capabilities for existing tool's log and stored session information.  RAFT supports directly importing from Burp files as well as Paros and WebScarab proxy logs.  Additionally, RAFT defines its own XML capture format that can be used to store traffic from custom tools; a urllib2 compatible processor module is provided.</p>

<p>RAFT is also proof-of-concept utility to help discover and crawl dynamic content, perform smart fuzzing, improve visibility into modern web applications, and serve as a testbed for exploring emerging HTML5 features.  By embedding QT's WebKit web browser, RAFT can interact directly with the rendered content using the browser DOM and injected JavaScript callbacks.  This provides interesting capabilities such as fuzzing for DOM based XSS injections in previously stored responses using a totally offline approach.  A future version of the tool is expected to contain an integrated scanner component and reusable analysis engine.</p>

<h3><a name="Rook"></a>David Rook</h3>
<h2>Agnitio</h2>
<p>Working with developers, security professionals and management to
cultivate an environment where secure code is written and flaws found
consistently requires both time and money. The same can be said for
producing informative reports and metrics when all of your security
code review data resides in notepad, Word and Excel files. With these
problems in mind I developed Agnitio to be my security code review
Swiss army knife and released it as a open source tool in late 2010.</p>

<p>In this demonstration filled presentation I will show how Agnitio can
be used to addresses repeatability, integrity and audit trail concerns
by requiring the creation of application profiles, the use of a
security code review checklist consisting of over 60 application
security questions and mandatory integrity checks for reviews and
reports created using the tool. I will demonstrate how the inbuilt
secure coding and security code review guidance modules allow
developers and security professionals to access the information they
need precisely when they need it. I will also show how Agnitio
automatically creates metrics and reports bringing much needed
visibility to the security code review process with no extra effort
required from the reviewer, developers or management.</p>

<p>Agnitio v2.0 will be released during this presentation which will see
Agnitio's already powerful feature set expanded to include more secure
coding and security code review guidance, additional report types,
developer and reviewer focused metrics and an automated source code
analysis module.

<h2>FireCAT: Weaponizing your Browser</h2>
<p>Basing us on the grateful browser Firefox and its personalization capabilities, we have created FireCAT: Firefox Catalog of Auditing exTensions.</p>

<p>FireCAT allows us to turn the browser to a powerful auditing weapon using only the appropriate extensions and great imagination.</p>

<p>Step to step will be explained, how is possible to have through Firefox a wide and varied utilities available list, to put in action!

<p>Trivia: The idea behind FireCAT came during a pentest. When I had challenged to performed it without any tool. So, Firefox along with extensions being with a great help.</p>

<p>What is FireCAT?</p>
<p>FireCAT (Firefox Catalog of Auditing exTension) is a mindmap collection of the most efficient and useful Firefox extensions oriented application security auditing and assessment. FireCAT is not a replacement of other security utilities and software as well as fuzzers, proxies and application vulnerabilities scanners.</p>
