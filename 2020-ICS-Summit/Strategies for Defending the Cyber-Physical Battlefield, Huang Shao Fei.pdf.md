Extract from "The Dawn of Kinetic Cyber" https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/10_d2r1s4_applegate.pdf
· Cyber attacks are often called non-violent or non-kinetic attacks, but the simple truth is that there is a credible capability to use cyber attacks to achieve kinetic effects.
· Kinetic Cyber refers to a class of cyber attacks that can cause direct or indirect physical damage, injury or death solely though the exploitation of vulnerable information systems and processes.
· The rapid growth and integration of cyber physical systems into everything from automobiles, aircraft and ships to SCADA systems implies a significant kinetic cyber threat in the near future.

STATE OF OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY - TECH LIMITATIONS
· Not as straightforward as most IT systems - requires specialised domain knowledge e.g. engineering, train operations
· Safety-critical OT components cannot be patched like IT equipment - requires elaborate verification & validation
· Forensic investigations difficult, and in some cases, impossible
· Legacy technology e.g. floppy disk drives, serial-port modems
· Outdated Operating Systems, incompatible software and drivers
· Performance limitations (CPU, memory etc.)

STATE OF OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY - SUPPLY-CHAIN RISKS
· Unconventional, chain-linked threats that do not depend on one single attack vector.
· Supply-chain threats include Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers and sub-contractors that could compromise security, with organisations being the last one to find out they've been compromised.
· Supply-chain challenges are especially acute in Operational Technology systems and may become worse.

STATE OF OT/ICS CYBERSECURITY - MONITORING RISKS
· "Noise" tells you about the process and the sensor performance
· Noise is filtered out e.g. Kalman before the Serial-ToEthernet converter
· Information about nuances of the processes and the sensors are not available for network anomaly detection

IMPLEMENTING AN OT CYBER DEFENCE STRATEGY

KEY THRUST 1: OT CYBERSECURITY TRAINING

1
Make cybersecurity training an organization-level priority.

2
Focus on incremental efforts, do not try to change the world overnight.

3
Reward and reinforce positive behaviours.

4
Make content engaging and relatable.

KEY THRUST 3: STRENGTHEN POLICIES AND PROCESSES
· Framework focusing on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organization's risk management processes.
· Knowing where you / your organisation is at (in terms of cyber maturity) is important, but do not set unrealistic goals.
· NIST Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1

SURVEY THE BATTLEFIELD
· Inventorize and understand what needs to be protected
· Differentiate between end-points that need raw data and those that need information
· Consider carefully decisions related to safety-critical equipment, and involve stakeholders early

The consensus of the Commission and participating investigative agencies is that the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger was caused by a failure in the joint between the two lower segments of the right Solid Rocket Motor. The specific failure was the destruction of the seals that are intended to prevent hot gases from leaking through the joint during the propellant burn of the rocket motor.

EXPLOIT POWER OF DATA

https://priceonomics.com/the-space-shuttle-challenger-explosion-and-the-o/
· The problem with most ICS/OT environments today is not the lack of data, but the overwhelming volume of "dirty" data
· Focus on building up cyber threat detection and response capability (and importantly, data analytics)
· Detecting "signals" from the noise

ALIGN YOUR STRATEGY
· ICS/OT systems generally engineered against deterministic outcomes, backed by evidence
· Safety cases are a good example of this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_case)
· "A vehicle safety case may show it to be acceptably safe to be driven on a road, but conclude that it may be unsuited to driving on rough ground, or with an offcenter load for example, if there would then be a greater risk of danger e.g. a loss of control or an injury to the occupant."
· Cyber-attacks (i.e. rogue threats) often produce random outcomes, never observed before during testing
· Strategies must be ALIGNED to operational and safety risks, and remain reasonably practical

KEY THRUST 4: ADOPT TECH FOR RESILIENCE
· Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering (CCE) is a methodology focused on securing the nation's critical infrastructure (CI) systems
· Developed at Idaho National Laboratory, CCE begins with the assumption that if CI is targeted by a skilled and determined adversary, the targeted operation can ­ and will ­ be sabotaged
· Consequences in ICS/OT are largely engineering and domain-specific. Compare to information security (C.I.A. triad)
· Manage legacy tech by focusing on safety-directed http://inl.gov/cce cybersecurity goals i.e. reach a Safe State

·Institutionalize cybersecurity policies & processes to inculcate good cybersecurity hygiene.

·Stand up CERT capabilities to defend systems and skills to face cyber threats.

·Conduct training to educate people and suppliers with awareness and skills to face cyber threats.
