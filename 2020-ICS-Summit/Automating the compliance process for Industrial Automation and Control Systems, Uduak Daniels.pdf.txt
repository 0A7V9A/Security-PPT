Oil and Gas Operations
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

An Overview

Large asset owner operations can be very complex
Operations require an extensive supply chain
Industrial automation and control systems used in production, processing, and distribution of products
Global and local regulations requiring compliance
Risk related to IT/OT systems

The Complexity of Securing IACS
· Legacy IACS systems · System Diversity · Adoption of IT systems vs. vendor proprietary systems for industrial
process automation · Operations focused on functionality and stability, rather than security · Require 99.999% system uptime · Systems modifications by asset owners, to address vulnerabilities,
may nullify ICS vendor warranty · Broad range of stakeholders required to confront ICS cybersecurity · Consequences of successful cyber attack may result in loss of life or
health, environmental impact, and significant financial loss

ICS Cybersecurity Compliance
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

What is Cybersecurity Compliance
· Conformance to cybersecurity rules · Rules otherwise known as controls or requirements originate from
global standards and frameworks · Cybersecurity controls are adopted by organizations based on risk
management, regulatory mandates, operational licenses, customer requirements · Controls usually represent minimum cybersecurity requirements · Compliance can be measured against people, process, and technology controls

ISA/IEC 62443 IACS Standard
 IACS Cybersecurity requirements
 Requirements for people, process, and technology
 Expanded from just the industrial process sector and applied to building automation, medical devices, and transportation sectors
 Considered the de facto standard for IACS
 Very wide global adoption  Introduces concepts like
security levels, and zone and conduits

ISASecure® Certification Scheme
 Third-party conformance assessment scheme
 Based on the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards
 ISASecure® develops and maintains the certification scheme
 ISASecure® certificate demonstrate compliance to applicable ISA/IEC 62443 requirements
 Certification establishes trust between IACS stakeholders

Compliance Control vs. Security Controls
 Requirements are based on risk  Controls are based on threat  Hackers care about your security  Unique to an organization  More rigorous to measure and test
controls  Controls change rapidly due to
threat
 Requirements are usually the minimum  Controls are based on standards and
frameworks  Regulators care about your compliance  One-size fits all organizations  Easy to measure and test controls  Controls change gradually based on
predefined review cycles

Compliance Myths
We are compliant, Hurray! We are finally secure ... not so fast

Compliance absolves me from accountability
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

Compliance is a business inhibitor

Once compliant,
always compliant
My automation vendor says don't do it,
now I am compliant

Compliance Assessment
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

Compliance Assessment Approaches

Approach

Description

Pros

Cons

Sample Set Controls Validation by an Assurance Entity

Conduct Compliance assessment by and for a subset of systems and processes

 Medium level of assurance  Frequent assessments
possible  Most affordable  Assurance entity personnel
required is limited

 Pushback from entities  Low level of assurance

Full Compliance SelfValidation, Sample Set Controls Validation by an Assurance Entity

Assessed entity conducts full assessments, assurance entity samples subset of systems with a full assessment

 Assurance entity personnel required is limited

 Low level of assurance  Likely biased results  Significant knowledge
transfer required  Expensive

Full Compliance Validation by an Assurance Entity

Conduct Compliance assessment for all inscope systems and processes

 High level of assurance  High independence

 Resource intensive  Pushback from entities  Expensive

Full Compliance SelfValidation, Full Compliance Validation by an Assurance Entity

Assessed entity conducts full assessments, assurance entity conducts full review of all assessed entity assessment reports

 Highest level of assurance  Assurance entity personnel
required is limited  High independence

 Significant knowledge transfer required
 Most expensive

Compliance Assessment Challenges in IACS
 Subjectivity  Remote facilities  High-level vs. Specific  A point in-time assurance  Determining inscope assets  IACS Cybersecurity knowledge gap

Compliance Assessment Process Phases

IDENTIFY COLLECT ANALYZE SCORE REPORT

 Define requirements
 IACS Asset Discovery
 IACS process documentation

 Scheduled Scanning
 Questionnaire completion
 Evidence gathering

 Review collected artifacts
 IACS Document Catalogue

 Assign score pass or fail
 Initiate waiver process as applicable

 Generate technical and management reports and dashboards
 Ticketing and escalation

Compliance Automation
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

Compliance Automation

DEFINITION Consolidates asset meta data,
controls, findings, workflows, scoring, reporting, and dashboards in one location Visualize and action all compliance assessment information in one location
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

BENEFITS Sampling not required Assessment frequency can increase
providing greater assurance Less manpower required Significant reduction in assessment
time Reduces potential for human error Keep up with new regulations Quick ability to test new controls More cost-effective, cheaper

Automation Scope
Automation occurs in some of the compliance assessment process phases
Full automation can only be truly obtained using predictive approaches
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

Compliance Process: Automated Phases
Identify
Assets can be discovered automatically Process documentation and questionnaire
completed centrally
Collect
Scheduled systems scans for automated evidence collection
Analyze
Automated comparison of findings
Scoring
Automated scoring computation
Reporting
Automated report and dashboard generation
Ticketing and Escalation
Integration with ticketing systems for escalation

Subcontrol Development
Compliance automation cannot occur if controls are high-level
Simple subcontrol development process flow
Objective is to subdivide high-level controls into binary tests
New nomenclature is introduced and mapped to the original standard control nomenclature
Reports will exclude newly introduced subcontrol or nomenclature
New subcontrol and nomenclature for internal assessment process only
Saudi Aramco: Company General Use

Controls & Sub-Controls Mapping
The process of accurately matching two requirements in separate standards to ensure the testing of one satisfies the other
Controls are usually done at the unit or binary level Controls that are candidates for mapping should not be
subjective When subjective controls should be interpreted into subcontrols  The Center for Internet Security provides a methodology and
actual control mapping of their control framework to a few cybersecurity standards
