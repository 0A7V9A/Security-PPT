Building an OT Security Community - A Case Example from NZ
This presentation will outline the steps that kiwis are taking to secure their industrial networks. Using the NZ-specific VCSS-CSO standard, NZ industrial organisations have been working to secure their infrastructure. To support this, a community has been building around communication and collaboration. The NZ Industrial Control System Cyber Technical Network (NZ ICS Cyber TN) has facilitated discussions on a number of topics for the community, allowing sharing on what works, and what doesn't, with a specific NZ flavour. Some case studies will be shared as well as the good, the bad and the ugly of securing industrial networks in NZ.
Peter Jackson - Engineering Manager (Cyber), SGS ECL

From Bad to Evil: Real Security Incidents and Findings from Live ICS Environments Assessments
While conducting health checks and compromise assessments on live ICS environments, interesting stories are behind discovering serious security incidents. This presentation is intended to share some of the evil discovered in live ICS environments in petrochemical, power and utilities industries. The presentation will also go through the stories behind these incidents which are believed to be useful to prevent similar incident in similar environments.

Automating the Compliance Process for Industrial Automation and Control Systems
The objective of this talk is to highlight an approach to implementing automated compliance workflows and concepts, for efficiently assessing the security of industrial automation and control systems, against organizational, national, and international policies, procedures, standards, and regulations. Operators are grappling with the increased burden of demonstrating due care as cybersecurity threats continue to broaden with potential impact on plant operations and reliability. This threat has led to the adoption of a multiple series of compliance mandates by operators and regulators, which requires measuring and reporting. The adoption of these requirements and controls for industrial automation and control systems (IACS) has continued to mature. The analysis and measurement of these controls have posed a challenge, with a significant increase in cost, resource allocation, inaccurate reporting, and continuous monitoring challenges. The development and adoption of an automated compliance assessment and reporting framework, helps to significantly reduce the assessment time and effort, eliminate subjectivity in analysis, address the ever-changing governance expectations, respond to the changing risk landscape, and increase frequency of the assessment and reporting lifecycle. The concept of compliance automation for IACS is not a new challenge; however, considerable obstacles exist which have limited adoption of compliance automation. A few of these risks - such as inconsistent information sources, lack of required skills, complexity, stakeholder engagement, and budget - have hindered its broader adoption. When achieved, compliance process automation will provide significant return on investment, and enable agility and resilience in an ever changing threat landscape.

Good Practices for ICS Supply Chain Risk Management
ICS supply chain risk management cannot be ignored from the perspective of both the threats and compliance in recent years. The big challenge is how you assess the risk of ICS assets in the procurement process. In the session, the good practices from the several industries and the ongoing activities in Japan will be explained after the short introduction of the current landscape of the threat, policy and certification for ICSsupply chain risk management.
Mr. Hiroshi Sasaki - Special Expert at Cyber Tech Lab Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA) Industrial Cybersecurity Security Center of Excellence (ICSCoE)

13:50 - 14:00 Break

14:00 - 14:30

Is Zero Trust Possible in OT Environments?
Zero trust is a security concept that advocates for constant monitoring and validation to ensure that only authorised users are accessing authorised devices and applications. No one and no devices are trusted by default. In this presentation, Dr Ong Chen Hui will share research findings and reflect upon the challenges they pose to implementing zero trust in OT environment.
Dr. Ong Chen Hui - APJ CTO, Trustwave

14:35 - 14:50

Protect Power Plant and Industrial Infrastructure from Cyber Attack! ICS Security Case Study in Japan
In the past, it has been a given that the control systems are isolated from the internet and information systems, instead operated in closed environments, making them safe. However, as systems become increasingly open due to digital transformation(DX), to connect Internet. This mentality regarding control systems has become out of date, and faces cyber threat.
This section describes the challenge of how to mitigate ICS cyber risk based on use-case at Power Plant and Industrial Infrastructure in Japan.

The Tools Dogma
Often ICS security tools are sold to asset owners as being the holy grail ... but in reality, they give those same asset owners most of the times a false sense of security as they believe they are well protected. Security tools are only a part of the equation to having a good security plan. Human elements, physical security and logical security go hand in hand. Within this presentation, shortcomings of ICS Security tools are mentioned as well as a potential road to an allencompassing risk assessment approach is shown. It requires very often to take a step back and look at your environment from different angles to understand the bigger picture. Doing so will allow you to enable present ICS security tools and tackle missing elements in other ways.
Dieter Sarrazyn, ICS Security Consultant at Secudea

15:35 - 15:55

Bounding Cyber in Design Basis Threat
The emergence of cyberweapons and the convergence of IT and OT, contribute to the exponential growth in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks, targeting critical infrastructure. The nuclear sector has recognized that it must employ compensating measures in order to ensure its most critical systems can defend, detect, delay, respond, and recover from cyber-attacks. The NRC has included cybersecurity requirements in the Physical Security and Design Basis Threat (DBT) Orders.
Jacob Benjamin, Principal Industrial Consultant, Dragos

16:00 - 16:30

Tips and Tricks from the ICS Assessment and Pen-Testers
At this session there will be presented a set of experiences and challenges in the production critical environment we have seen and how to protect these challenges. The session will not present information about asset inventory and segmentation but will e.g. look into how a hacker can exploit and take control and how you can protect against these attacks. The session will also show some information on what you should expect from an ICS pen-tester and some differences between pen-testing IT vs ICS environments. How secure is your production critical environment?

ICS Attack Concepts and Demonstrations
In this talk we will start with the assumption that corporate business networks are breached and adversaries have discovered a path into your control system network ­ and then we consider, what are some common attack approaches that adversaries can pursue within a process environment? In this final presentation of the day, we will walk through a lightning round of attack demonstrations targeting local process network communications, logic analysis, and implementing process attacks that leverage ICS devices as both targets and attack delivery nodes ­ ultimately attacking the control system from within the control system.
