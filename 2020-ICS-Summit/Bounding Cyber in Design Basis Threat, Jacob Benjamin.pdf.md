EXAMPLE DBT
IAEA DBT WORKSHOP
Attempt of theft of a significant amount of Nuclear Material (e.g. 10Kg of Pu) by a group of 6 outsiders equipped with 10 Kg TNT explosive, automatic weapons (including light infantry weapons) and specific commercially available intrusion tools. They have a comprehensive knowledge of the facility and associated physical protection measures. Willing to die or to kill. No collusion with insider.

NUCLEAR CYBER SECURITY
Cybersecurity risk mitigation for nuclear power plants began
in 2002 and 2003, when the NRC included cybersecurity requirements in the Physical
Security and Design Basis Threat Orders.

RESULT
CYBER DBT
Attempt to cause physical damage to Safety Instrumentation Systems. The adversary has been known to use Drive-By Compromise, External Remote Services, Valid Accounts, and Supply Chain Compromise, and ICS-Tailored Malware. They have destructive capabilities, understand process implications, and have specific knowledge of industrial control systems. Willing to to cause physical harm or kill. No collusion with insider.
