The Challenge
Organizations of all types are facing new cyber threats due to the evolving work environment: employees now have access to social networking, file sharing applications, cloud storage, webmail, instant messaging, SaaS applications (CRM, virtual desktop infrastructure). In addition, employees bring their own devices to the office and regularly work from home or remote locations. These trends increase the risk of infection by infiltration of malware and the risk of exfiltration of sensitive information.
Security vendors have responded with new solutions for malware protection, data loss prevention (DLP) and threat analysis. To be effective, these products need to dig deep into the payload of network traffic and extract detailed information such as file content (typically decrypted payload).
Strengthening Solutions with Qosmos ixEngine
Enea's Qosmos ixEngine is a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) library which classifies protocols, and extracts metadata and file content. It provides extraction and facilitates reconstruction of network traffic content within cyber security solutions. This gives developers the ability to expose file movements at the network level to track potential malware and data exfiltration.
Qosmos software can be used to extract raw traffic content and metadata to reconstruct complete emails, attached files, images, videos, transferred files (uploaded or downloaded via FTP, HTTP, Dropbox), Websites, etc.
Qosmos ixEngine Capabilities
 Content and file extraction: The most comprehensive and mature file extraction library supporting over 60 protocols for file extraction, including all transport types for Server Message Block (SMB) and all generic HTTP transfers
 Deep file inspection: Efficient file type detection, file hashing, and metadata extraction for file reconstruction
These capabilities are already built into the Qosmos DPI engine, which means that developers are able to focus all efforts on sensors and the features and performance of the overall security solution.

Use Case: Qosmos ixEngine® for Malware Protection and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
The following example illustrates how Qosmos ixEngine can be used in different parts of a complete security solution.
Initially, network traffic is captured through a tap or port mirror using, for example, Intel® DPDK libraries for fast packet processing.
The traffic is then scanned by an Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS / IPS), which could be open source (Snort, Suricata), or proprietary. Results are fed to the mitigation system.
Step 1: Object & Content Extraction
Qosmos ixEngine ingests network traffic considered as clean by the IDS and extracts content elements. The software reorders content, extracts payload and saves content of each object into a file (even if there are multiple objects in a single packet).
 Streamed raw content: downloaded files, uploaded files, emails, attached files and file types (MS Office, PDF, .exe, etc.)
 Metadata: URLs, IP address, sender, receiver, file type, etc.
Step 2a: Object Reconstruction
Software for object reconstruction can be developed in-house by the security vendor, or with the help of Qosmos Professional Services.
Based on the information from Qosmos ixEngine, each object is reconstructed: files, pictures, JavaScripts, emails, email attachments, etc.
 Emails: body of text , metadata (sender, receiver, IP address, etc.), attached files (content, photos, etc.)
 File Transfer: HTTP downloads, FTP files, etc.

Step 2b: File Analysis
This step focuses on checking file integrity and is performed in parallel with object reconstruction.
 File hashes: CRC, SHA-1, MD5
 Extension types: MIME mismatch, real file extension
At this stage, the Qosmos ixEngine Deep File Inspection module can be used to detect file type, check consistency between MIME type and file extension, compute file hash, and extract metadata.
Step 3: Investigation
Investigation methods are part of a security vendor's core expertise, based on a combination of techniques such as:
 File inspection: malware pattern matching, confidentiality, file integrity check, etc.
 Sandboxing: removing suspicious software from traffic and running it in an isolated environment to observe and analyze behavior
 Identifying suspicious URLs in emails (phishing)
Step 4: Mitigation
Features and functionality for this step are always developed in-house by cyber security experts, leveraging advanced techniques such as deception-based methods (honey pots), self-optimizing protection, or machine learning algorithms. Effective mitigation also requires connection between several functions such as policy enforcement by NGFW or network behavior anomaly detection.
 Alerts: for suspicious traffic or user behavior
 Quarantine: isolation of infected devices
 Blocking: botnet traffic, malicious connections
