What the f.....

Fraud, is that a problem?

I have not found any Swedish calculations, but:
- Annual Fraud Indicator 2016. The United Kingdom Fraud
Costs Measurement Committee (UKFCMC)

2.156.000.000.000 Sek ( 245 biljon $ 2015)

Corresponds to 33.169 Sek / inhabitant
(or 3.782 $ / inhabitant)

A not too scientific comparison but:
-The same conditions regarding computer density, the number of Internet connections per inhabitant, E-commerce
tendencies and so on... - Criminal Propensity / naivety?
- Sweden 9 920 881 inhabitants - 33.169 Sek per capita

329.065.701.889 Sek
( Or 37.521.744.799 $ )

What does the amount represent?
- 5 x as much as Healthcare / Social Care (2015) - 7 x as much as the defense & crisis budget (2015) - 10.140 kr / sec ( Or 1.156 $ / sec )
