Staying Sharp on Security
Takeaways from the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report
Microsoft regularly aggregates the latest worldwide security data into the Security Intelligence Report (SIR), unpacking the most pressing issues in cybersecurity. Here are some highlights from SIR, Volume 22, which covers January to March 2017:

Cloud threat intelligence
The cloud has become the central data hub for any organization, which means it's also a growing target for attackers.

Compromised accounts
DEFINITION: Attackers break into the cloud-based account simply by using the stolen sign-in credentials of a user
ANALYSIS: A large majority of these compromises are the result of weak, guessable passwords and poor password management, followed by targeted phishing attacks and breaches of third-party services.

OBSERVED ACCOUNTS UNDER ATTACK DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2016 AND 2017

Drive-by download sites
DEFINITION: A website that hosts malware in its code and can infect a vulnerable computer simply by a web visit
ANALYSIS: Attackers sneak malicious code into legitimate but poorly secured websites. Machines with vulnerable browsers can become infected by malware simply by visiting the site. Bing search constantly monitors sites for malicious elements or behavior, and displays prominent warnings before redirecting to any suspicious site.
Taiwan and Iran have the highest
concentration of drive-by
download pages.

DRIVE-BY DOWNLOAD PAGES PER 1,000 URLS, APRIL 2017

0.5+ 0.1 to 0.5 0.05 to 0.1

0.01 to 0.05 >0 to 0.01 Insufficient data

WORLDWIDE: 0.17

Endpoint threat intelligence
An endpoint is any device remotely connected to a network that can provide an entry point for attackers­­such as a laptop or mobile device. Since users interact with an endpoint, it remains a key opportunity for attackers and a security priority for organizations.

Ransomware
DEFINITION: Malware that disables a computer or its files until an amount of money is paid to the attackers
ANALYSIS: Ransomware attacks have been on the rise, disrupting major organizations and grabbing global headlines. Attacks like WannaCry and Petya disabled thousands of machines worldwide in the first half of 2017. Windows 10 includes mitigations that prevent common exploitation techniques by these and other ransomware threats.

RANSOMWARE ENCOUNTER RATES, MARCH 2017
0.16%+ 0.12% to 0.16% 0.08% to 0.12% 0.04% to 0.08% >0 to 0.04%

Ransomware disproportionately targeted Europe with Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary, Spain, Romania, and Croatia being the top six countries with the highest encounter rates.

Exploit kits
DEFINITION: A bundle of malicious software that discovers and abuses a computer's vulnerabilities
ANALYSIS: Once installed on a compromised web server, exploit kits can easily reach any computer lacking proper security updates that visits the site.

Many of the more dangerous exploits are used in targeted
attacks before appearing in the wild
in larger volumes.

You visit a compromised
webpage.

Your computer

The webpage contacts an exploit
landing page.

The exploit page finds out what your computer is vulnerable to...
...and chooses exploits that will specifically infect your computer.

Takeaways and checklist
The threats and risks of cyberattacks are constantly changing and growing. However, there are some practical steps you can take to minimize your exposure:

Reduce risk of credential compromise by educating users on why they should avoid simple passwords, enforcing multi-factor authentication and applying alternative authentication methods (e.g., gesture or PIN).

Enforce security policies that control access to sensitive data and limit corporate network access to appropriate users, locations, devices, and operating systems (OS).

Do not work in public Wi-Fi hotspots where attackers could eavesdrop on your communications, capture logins and passwords, and access your personal data.

Regularly update your OS and other software to ensure the latest patches are installed.
