SOLUTION BRIEF
ZscalerTM Web Security

Zscaler Web Security, part of the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, delivers the complete security stack as a cloud service, eliminating the cost and complexity of traditional secure web gateway appliances. By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet and web gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all mobile users or offices via local Internet breakouts, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.

THE TRADITIONAL SECURITY PERIMETER IS BROKEN
When applications in your data center were the center of gravity, it made sense to backhaul your branch office traffic to them over a hub-and-spoke network. Even as more traffic was headed for the Internet and threats got more complex, you could still protect your perimeter and users with stacks of gateway appliances.
However, your applications have moved to the cloud and the center of gravity with it. Your users have also left the building, so traffic goes straight to their cloud apps over the open Internet, bypassing your perimeter and appliances all together. The result is that the Internet is now become the new corporate network as mobility and the cloud have broken traditional network security models.

BREACHES CONTINUE DESPITE APPLIANCE INVESTMENTS
Despite massive appliance investments, delivering complete web security still eludes many organizations. Even when safely browsing trusted websites, users continue to fall victim to a host of Internet-based threats.
With the rise of SSL, zero-day threats, botnets, and other attacks, proper web security now requires a fully integrated inspection approach. Hardware appliances, due to their limited capacity, often ignore "trusted" content and SSL traffic, where many of today's threats can live. Additionally, multiple appliances that are service chained together aren't nimble enough to share and update threat intelligence at the speed needed to properly respond to developing threats.

A 90s Internet Gateway ­ Bad Design?
Delivering security in today's gateway is expensive to deploy, complex to maintain, and delivers a poor user experience.
· Firewall/IPS · Web/URL Filter · Anti-virus · DLP Inspection · SSL Interception · Sandbox Analysis
Despite massive appliance investments, breaches continue. It's clear this aging design has lost its effectiveness.

Go from global visibility to actionable intelligence in seconds. If you can't understand what your alerts are trying to tell you, what's the point? The Zscaler admin portal helps you easily drill down to find and stop botnets, malware and zero-days with a few simple clicks.

MASTER DATA COMPLIANCE
Zscaler was purpose built with compliance and enterprise scale in mind. Customers can maintain true data residency compliance with their alert log data. Logs always remain in memory and are written to disk only within the customerspecified location. You can easily meet regulatory requirements based on the country in which your data needs to reside.
For compliance mandates on local log archival, Zscaler NanologTM Streaming Service (NSS) allows you to transmit your logs to your SIEM in real time for external logging or advanced threat correlation. You can even fine-tune threat feeds to receive particular data in order to accommodate SIEM Events Per Second (EPS) restrictions.

Zscaler applied immediate value during the proof-of-concept when we identified botnet infected machines. We've easily seen a 60% drop in malware related tickets after rolling out Zscaler.
