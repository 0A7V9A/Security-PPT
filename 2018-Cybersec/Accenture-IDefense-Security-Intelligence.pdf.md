SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

Business disruption and damaged reputation may cost an organization billions of dollars. Cyber attacks and high-profile data breaches dominate today's headlines. Security teams are struggling to keep up with the volume of threat intelligence and the sophistication of attacks. iDefense Security Intelligence Services provides timely, relevant and actionable security intelligence through the next generation IntelGraph platform that provides context, powerful visualizations, advanced searching, alerting and a robust RESTful API.

Threat actors are constantly evolving their tools and

techniques, while launching powerful targeted campaigns against organizations. Traditional tools deployed against these actors are proving insufficient to detect and prevent attacks. Reliable threat intelligence is needed to understand the security risk before it hits. Threat Intelligence is not just important for protecting an organization's assets and preventing threats, but it is an essential component in all stages of the security life-cycle including mitigation, detection and recovery.

IntelGraph is built with graph database technology at its core. Graph databases utilize graph theory and allow nodes that contain relational information concerning malware, vulnerabilities, malicious tools, indicators, threat actors, campaigns, targets, phishing emails, and other threat elements. This structure enables faster access to relevant data and provides the ability to start at any data point and navigate, through use of the relational information.
