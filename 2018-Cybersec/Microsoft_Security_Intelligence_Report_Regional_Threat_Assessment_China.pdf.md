Security software use
Recent releases of the MSRT collect and report details about the state of realtime antimalware software on a computer, if the computer's administrator has chosen to opt in to provide data to Microsoft. This telemetry data makes it possible to analyze security software usage patterns around the world and correlate them with infection rates.

The figure below shows the percentage of computers worldwide and in China that the MSRT found to be running up-to-date real-time security software in March 2017.

Malicious websites
Attackers often use websites to conduct phishing attacks or distribute malware. Malicious websites typically appear completely legitimate and often provide no outward indicators of their malicious nature, even to experienced computer users. In many cases, these sites are legitimate websites that have been compromised by malware, SQL injection, or other techniques, in an effort by attackers to take advantage of the trust users have invested in them. To help protect users from malicious webpages, Microsoft and other browser vendors have developed filters that keep track of sites that host malware and phishing attacks and display prominent warnings when users try to navigate to them.

The information presented in this section has been generated from telemetry data produced by Windows Defender SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. See the Malicious Websites section of Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 22 for more information about these protections and how the data is collected.
