DATA CLASSIFICATION
Identify and protect your most valuable information

If you don't understand what data you have, how can you know how to protect it?
Data classification allows your users to assign a visual label to the data they create, so that informed decisions can be taken about how it is managed, protected and shared, both within and outside of your organisation.

Boldon James Classifier turns that visual label into metadata, which can be used to both enforce your company's security policies and drive other technologies, such as data loss prevention, information rights management and archiving solutions.
The result is streamlined business processes with data security at the core, reducing risk and improving security culture.
