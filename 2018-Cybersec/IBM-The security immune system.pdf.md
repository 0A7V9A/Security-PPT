The security immune system
An integrated approach to protecting your organization

Why a security immune system makes sense now

We've heard it time and again. When it comes to cybersecurity threats, no one is immune.

But when we look at cybersecurity, the traditional defense strategy is to layer on another point-product tool or technology to an already fragmented and disjointed IT environment.

No business, no government, no individual. In fact, the entire conversation has shifted from focusing on "if you're attacked" to "how quickly you can respond." And that's not likely to change in the foreseeable future.

That's why IBM has developed an integrated and intelligent security immune system.

So let's think about the concept of immunity for a minute. As humans, we have finely tuned--and highly adaptive--immune systems ready to help us fight off all kinds of attacks that would otherwise threaten to destroy us. Made up of cells, tissues and organs that work together to defend us against attacks by "foreign" invaders, a healthy immune system can distinguish between the body's own cells and those that don't belong. It's an intelligent, organized and efficient system that can instantly recognize an invader and take action to either block its entry or destroy it.

Integration and intelligence take the lead

Today's expanded security arsenal of fragmented, disconnected point products has added complexity without significantly improving the overall security posture of the organization. The result? A bloated infrastructure that makes it more difficult to monitor the network as a whole, often leaving security teams to operate in the dark.

It's time to take a more holistic view of your security portfolio.

The IBM Security immune system is a fully integrated approach that allows its components to grow and adapt within the infrastructure--working together to deliver intelligence, visibility and actionable insights across the entire system.
And once the IBM Security immune system is fully engaged with your entire ecosystem--allowing collaboration across third-party vendors, technology providers and business partners--it can provide you with the intelligence you need to understand existing threats and adapt to new ones.

Some organizations report they're using as many as 85 security products--from more than 40 vendors--at once. As each tool is added, the costs associated with installing, configuring, managing, upgrading and patching continue to grow. And with the skills gap plaguing the industry, it's easy to see how more threats are continuing to generate more vendors, more tools-- and more headaches.

The IBM Security immune system looks at a security portfolio in a more organized fashion--as an integrated framework of security capabilities that transmits and ingests vital security data to help gain visibility, understand and prioritize threats, and coordinate multiple layers of defense. At its core, the system uses security intelligence and analytics to automate policies and block threats--just as the human immune system can automatically assess and identify a virus, for example, and trigger an immune response.

The break-in
One of Company B's account executives is in a taxi, on his way to the airport for a trip to a customer site. Stuck in traffic, he pulls out his laptop, checks the company's intranet for some project details and sends out a few emails. What he doesn't know is that he triggered an attack via drive-by download. And because he's almost always on the road, he hasn't had much contact with the company's IT security team. So his laptop may not have been updated with the latest patches.

IBM BigFix® would allow Company B's IT security team to discover unmanaged endpoints (such as this employee's laptop) and get real-time visibility into all its endpoints to identify vulnerabilities and those endpoints that are noncompliant.

As it turns out, Company B's account executive had indeed missed getting the latest patches installed on his laptop. By the time he reaches the airport, the download has already latched onto the company's network and infects its internal system as part of a botnet.

With IBM QRadar® Network Security (XGS), Company B would be able to gain visibility into the network traffic, automatically analyze suspicious files with IBM X-Force Malware Analysis on Cloud and actively block communication with the botnet's command and control server, based on intelligence provided by IBM X-Force Exchange. It can also effectively block zero-day exploit traffic and then send those traffic flows to IBM QRadar Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for anomaly detection.

Company C is aware that in 2015, 60 percent of attacks were carried out by insiders, either ones with malicious intent or inadvertent actors.4 In other words, those attacks were instigated or initiated by people you would likely trust with access to your company's assets--including hard copy documents, disks, electronic files and laptops. Insiders could be employees of the company, or business partners, clients or even maintenance contractors.

Privileged identity management
With multiple locations in both urban and suburban settings, Company C employs a large number of individuals--including part-time hourly workers and several levels of management personnel. In addition, there are often teams of contractors brought in to work on special projects. The one thing they all have in common? A need for ongoing access to the company's systems and data. That's why the company uses IBM Security Privileged Identity Manager to help prevent advanced insider threats. It provides a centralized approach to managing access to privileged accounts, allowing users to "check out" these accounts when they need access to sensitive systems. Each of these special sessions is automatically recorded, providing an audit trail and helping to ensure that privileged access is not misused. In addition, the company relies on IBM Security Guardium® to cross-reference that information as it audits user access to data that's either at rest or in motion.

Activity monitoring

While monitoring and auditing privileged user access, Guardium can also

identify abnormal or suspicious behavior and block illicit data and file access

with real-time response. One day the system observes that several large files

have been downloaded onto a thumb drive by one of Company C's part-time

employees. Because the system recognizes that action as unusual activity--

given the employee's responsibilities--it issues an alert flagging that behavior.

Or it could deny access to the data in question. Company C might also take

advantage of IBM QRadar User Behavior Analytics to gain early visibility

into related insider threats by analyzing other employees' usage patterns to

determine if their credentials or systems have been compromised. It can identify

users by name, add suspects to a watch list or drill down into underlying log

and flow data. What's more, Guardium can share any illicit activity it finds to help

QRadar User Behavior Analytics fine-tune its analytics, and then go on to share

any anomalous activity it finds with Guardium.

Company C is aware that in 2015, 60 percent of attacks were carried out by insiders, either ones with malicious intent or inadvertent actors.4 In other words, those attacks were instigated or initiated by people you would likely trust with access to your company's assets--including hard copy documents, disks, electronic files and laptops. Insiders could be employees of the company, or business partners, clients or even maintenance contractors. Here's an example of how Information Risk and Protection solutions help thwart insider threats.

Identity governance
IBM Security Identity Governance and Access lets Company C's IT managers and auditors govern insider access and ensure
regulatory compliance across the organization. It helps the company mitigate access risks and access policy violations
by combining intelligence-driven, business-driven identity governance with end-to-end user lifecycle management. What's
more, it checks for segregation of duties violations and runs access certification campaigns to help ensure the validity of
privileged access rights.

A case in point: The potential for fraud
Most companies would find it difficult to discuss IT security without talking about fraud. And that's especially true for financial services organizations. Company D is engaged in the consumer side of the financial services business, where it's important to recognize that some of the very conveniences that banks now routinely offer customers--including automated teller machines, credit cards and mobile banking apps--have introduced a level of accessibility that goes a long way toward making the financial system highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. But Information Risk and Protection solutions can help significantly reduce the risk of fraud--without complicating the user experience.

Logging in
Laura M. is a Company D customer who wants to move money from one of her accounts to another via mobile phone. It takes just a few seconds for her to log in, using her online ID and security code. But in those few seconds, IBM Security Access Manager (ISAM) is validating Laura's password, determining her location, making note of the date and time, and identifying the IP address for the device she's using. Doing so helps Company D block fraudulent and high-risk transactions by analyzing user information and correlating user behavior and device attributes in real time--so it can determine whether Laura is who she says she is.

Protecting customers from fraud
Next, IBM Trusteer® solutions help figure out whether Laura is a true customer or a fraudster--by determining whether the device she's using is valid, analyzing her behavior and helping to verify that neither her credentials nor her phone have been compromised. Trusteer also notes that Laura isn't just checking her account balance, but wants to transfer funds from one account to another. If it finds any evidence to suspect that it's dealing with a fraudster, it can restrict functionality based on bank policies, without alerting him or her that they've been detected. All this happens behind the scenes--in seconds--without giving Laura any reason to know or care about what's going on.

Exercising necessary caution
Of course there are certain circumstances under which Laura's actions might be subject to additional scrutiny to help
protect both the bank and herself. For example, ISAM could move to enforce additional rules, asking Laura to perform a second authentication step (such as getting a second password) if she wanted to transfer over $10,000. And if she wanted to transfer millions of dollars, even multi-step
authentication would likely be insufficient. She would instead be told to visit the bank in person.

Why IBM

Today's threats continue to rise in numbers and scale, as sophisticated attackers break through conventional safeguards every day.
The demand for leaked data is trending toward higher-value records containing personally identifiable information and other highly sensitive data, with less emphasis on the emails, passwords and even credit card data that were the targets of years past.5
And hardly a week goes by when the media isn't reporting that yet another prominent organization has fallen victim to a data breach, costing many millions of dollars. In fact, the average cost of a data breach is now $3.62 million.6
A piecemeal approach to security simply will not work. It's time to move beyond methods that assemble defenses for specific needs but lack the integration to extend security across enterprise assets and vulnerabilities. It's time for a comprehensive, integrated security immune system that delivers leading technology, best practices and flexibility. To protect your valuable resources, you need a system that relies on today's intelligence, not yesterday's narrow definition of known threats.

When you partner with IBM, you gain access to a security team of more than 8,000 people supporting more than 12,000 customers in 133 countries. As a proven leader in enterprise security, we hold more than 3,500 security patents. And by combining the security immune system with advanced cognitive computing, we let organizations like yours continue to innovate while reducing risk. So you can continue to grow your business--while securing your most critical data and processes.

Statement of Good Security Practices: IT system security involves protecting systems and information through prevention, detection and response to improper access from within and outside your enterprise. Improper access can result in information being altered, destroyed, misappropriated or misused or can result in damage to or misuse of your systems, including for use in attacks on others. No IT system or product should be considered completely secure and no single product, service or security measure can be completely effective in preventing improper use or access. IBM systems, products and services are designed to be part of a lawful, comprehensive security approach, which will necessarily involve additional operational procedures, and may require other systems, products or services to be most effective. IBM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE IMMUNE FROM, OR WILL MAKE YOUR ENTERPRISE IMMUNE FROM, THE MALICIOUS OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY PARTY.
