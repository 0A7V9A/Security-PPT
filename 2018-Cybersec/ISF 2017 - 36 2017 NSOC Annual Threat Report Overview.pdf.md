SOC Operations
· Texas Government Code 2059 ­ DIR will provide perimeter security · DIR is the Internet Service Provider (ISP) for its internet customers
· Maintain Internet availability for customers 24X7X365 · Uptime is crucial therefore the NSOC provides DDoS monitoring and mitigation to
its customers through its' ISPs
· High Volume....Everything is bigger in Texas!
· Blocking in excess of 3 billion unauthorized or malicious communication attempts against our shared network per month! 4 billion in March
· Protecting over 2.8 million public facing IP addresses · 25TB of data each day passes through our security tools
· As the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and without endpoints we have limitations on how aggressive our security posture may be
· Customers own their data and have ISOs/CISOs that manage their risk

SOC Staff
· SOC is staffed with high quality security professionals
· This includes leaders and highly trained engineers and analysts that can respond appropriately to the threats facing the NSOC
· We can make large investments in tools but if the Security Team is not enabled to perform their job duties either though a failure in process or governance then the program will not be successful
· Current Staff expertise includes:
· Network Security architect · Senior Analysts · Security Engineers · IT Governance · Ethical Hackers · Project Management

Tools
Security Operation Center (SOC): The benefit of running multiple tools is that they all have strengths and weaknesses and some are better at catching certain types of events. Having multiple tools and partners watching similar traffic from different perspectives has enabled us to provide better protection and alerting to our customers
· Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) · Network Forensics Tool (NFT) · Malware detection System (MDS) · Intrusion Detection System (IDS) open source

Services
· Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Albert -is an IDS monitoring service that is being provided to the NSOC at no cost through an Inter-Agency Agreement with the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)
· Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Panopticon is a low cost IDS service
that is being provided to the NSOC through an Inter-Agency agreement with the University of Texas
· DDOS 24X7 monitoring and mitigation service
· Being provided by DIR's Internet Service Providers (AT&T, Century Link)
· 150mb threshold on 10gbps pipes although smaller events can be mitigated
· DDOS service is bandwidth focused not resource exhaustion focused

SOC Strategy
· Aggressive blocking
· We have taken an aggressive blocking stance · We block any known bad IPs or domains · We block IPs we catch scanning or attempting brute force logins
· Monitor outbound traffic
· Last layer of protection · Watching for call-outs and beaconing · Unusual connections
· Alerting the agencies to suspicious activity
· Send the alert with a summary of the suspicious activity, evidence, research, and remediation to the affected agency and
· All Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs) are added to our statewide GRC tool for incident tracking purposes

Alerting Process
· Analysts review data from IPS, IDS, NFT, MDS outside parties etc. · They gather collaborating evidence of the suspected malicious activity
from the other tools · They send the agency security team an alert via email and GRC Archer
· Summary of the suspected malicious behavior · The believed culprit or malware variant · Indicators of compromise are identified · Console screenshots and/or tool logs as evidence of the traffic · Information/Research links on that malware · Recommended remediation procedures for that malware

Cyber Intel Sharing
· Information Sharing, DIR actively participates in cyber security information sharing with:
FBI US Cert MS-ISAC DIR Vendor partners NSOC Security Tools Security Industry researchers Our Customers
· This Cyber intelligence is added back into our tools to better protect our customers and our networks
