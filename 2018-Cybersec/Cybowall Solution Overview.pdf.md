SMB CYBER BREACH CASE STUDIES
Maine Indoor Karting, US
· Targeted by a phishing scam · The owner, Rick Snow, received an email that appeared to be from his bank, asking him to log in with his account information · Mr. Snow realized he had fallen victim to a phishing scam, closed his business account and opened a new account · Hacked again 2 weeks later and the attackers stole over USD $37,000 to clear out his business bank account
MNH Platinum, UK
· Victim of a virus which encrypted over 12,000 files on its company network · A ransom demand followed; the criminals would decrypt the company's files in exchange for more than GBP £3,000 · The company paid the ransom as the virus proved impossible to remove without the loss of crucial company data
PCA Predict, UK
· Targeted by Russian hackers who sent out a spam email to 1.5 million people, claiming that GBP £120 had been charged to each person · Customer service nightmare; company received overwhelming volume of calls and emails as people tried to get their money back · As a technology company, PCA Predict was lucky that it could use its systems to respond quickly; recording a phone message explaining
the issue and changing its homepage to a warning about the spam

SMB CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES
RESOURCES & EXPERTISE SMBs face the same threat with fewer resources and lack in-house expertise
RECOVERY FROM A CYBER ATTACK 33% of SMBs took 3 days to recover from an attack, and 60% of SMBs lose their business within 6 months of an attack
COST OF DATA BREACH Recovery from a SMB data breach can cost between USD $36,000 $50,000

GLOBAL ATTACK TARGET 43% of global attacks targeted SMBs with fewer than 250 staff (9% increase on previous year)
SPEAR PHISHING CAMPAIGNS 55% increase from previous year in number of spear phishing campaigns targeting all businesses
CYBER ATTACK RESPONSE PLAN 8 out of 10 SMBs don't have a basic cyber attack response plan

SMB BUYER PROFILE
 Organizations with USD $1­15 million annual
revenue are looking for a comprehensive yet affordable security solution
 On average only around 8% of a SMB's budget
goes towards the business' security
 Many enterprise solutions require an
investment of at least $200,000
 Small and medium sized organizations will
often not have a SOC or CISO; most enterprise solutions demand a dedicated analyst interpreting threats
