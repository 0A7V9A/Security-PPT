Transforming Data Into Answers
Security and IT solutions to reduce risk, accelerate innovation, and advance your business

Innovation is a funny thing, in a cosmic sort of way.
While it's driving your business forward, it's also exposing it to new risks that can really slow you down. As an IT or security professional, you need to know every day: Are you vulnerable? Are you compromised? And finally, are you optimized to quickly spot and solve issues to keep your operation humming? It's your role to help your organization thrive, safely and reliably, on the latest connected technologies. So how can you outsmart this little paradox? That's where we can help.
Rapid7 solutions are powered by advanced analytics and an unmatched understanding of the attacker mindset. With the Insight platform--the first and only to combine vulnerability management, user behavior analytics-powered SIEM, application security, and IT log analytics--we make it easy to collect data, transform it into prioritized and actionable insight, and get it to the people who can act on it--all in an instant.
With all of these answers in one place, you won't just outsmart the innovation paradox, you'll pwn it.

RAPID7 INSIGHT
A SECURITY ANALYTICS PLATFORM
THE NEXT-GENERATION PLATFORM FOR SECURITY AND IT PROFESSIONALS
The foundation of the Insight platform is technology simplifying the comprehensive data collection across your entire IT environment.

In addition to the contextual data and analytics that power your products, you benefit from the analyzed data that is fed between applications in real-time for immediate, actionable insight.

Centralization supplies the context needed for advanced data analysis, delivering simple answers to your most complex security and IT questions.

Insight's shared services power advanced analytics with machine learning, proprietary machine data search, data visualization, easy and comprehensive reporting, and seamlessly integrated solutions.

EACH DAY, THE INSIGHT PLATFORM:

+50 BILLION

Analyzes +50 Billion events

+20TB Indexes +20TB of data

+32 MILLION
Prioritizes risk across +32 million assets

Each year, the amount of data grows exponentially, the threat of attacks becomes more brutal, and the challenge of minimizing risk and optimizing operations gets more complex. It can feel like a never-ending battle, yet we continue to fight to keep our organizations secure, productive, and moving forward. Why? Because we love solving problems and making it all work.
The Rapid7 Insight platform delivers on all fronts The Insight platform is built on nearly two decades of active research, a constantly expanding vulnerability and exploit database, Rapid7's Metasploit project, the learnings from our threat hunting team, and the thousands of penetration tests we conduct every year. This extensive and constantly fresh knowledge, combined with advanced analytics-- including user behavior and exposure analytics, deception technologies, threat modeling, intelligence feeds, and machine learning--is applied to your data from network scans, logs, and endpoints. Rapid7 Insight delivers actionable guidance for vulnerability management, incident detection, application security, and IT optimization, transforming your data into answers.
Reduce Complexity. Reduce TCO. Increase Confidence. It's time to simplify. IT and Security teams are burdened with time-consuming tasks such as maintaining hardware, building analytics models, deploying honeypots, recruiting from a not-big-enough pool of practitioners, trying to understand how to use threat intelligence, hunting for the attacker--you get the idea. To lift the burden, Rapid7 Insight and our managed services address these needs and so much more. Now, from a unified platform, you can find, manage, and reduce your risk.
Our secure cloud platform provides real-time IT and security analytics to reduce your organization's infrastructure costs, while Rapid7 partner integrations act as a force multiplier to already deployed solutions. This combination enables faster analysis, prioritization, and remediation, while consolidating your data across larger environments, with the flexibility to segment based on specific needs.
Beyond a reduction in total cost of ownership (TCO), the benefits of moving to a platform-based security and IT risk model are numerous:
· Remove complexity and friction between security tools in order to identify and manage risk.
· Identify threats, eliminate vulnerabilities, and optimize operations with automated computing power that continuously analyzes and correlates data, transforming it into answers.
· Integrate workflows, management, real-time analysis, and reporting across your network and through to your endpoints, with core shared services across multiple security and IT solutions.
· Baseline vulnerabilities, user behavior, and processes with lightweight universal agents, which allow you to detect risk when it happens, while allowing the user to perform live assessment when it's needed.
