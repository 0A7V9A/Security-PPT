SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER
24/7 WORRY-FREE SAFETY MONITORING SERVICE
Blackline's safety monitoring and gas detection solutions deliver complete customization and 24/7 real-time safety monitoring for any application. Our Safety Operations Center provides organizations with expert safety monitoring and support, ensuring superior employee safety monitoring without sacrificing business productivity.
While some businesses are capable of self-monitoring, with designated control rooms or highly available supervisors, many are better supported by our in-house monitoring team. Blackline's Safety Operations Center (SOC) focuses exclusively on monitoring the well-being of employees' safety. Unlike traditional call centers that often split focus between telemarketing and IT support, our SOC is staffed professionally-trained monitoring agents 365 days a year.
Our SOC utilizes the Blackline Live web portal, providing them with critical insights into emergency alerts in real-time. Delivering situational awareness communicated from employeeworn devices in the field, Blackline Live provides all the tools necessary for the SOC to manage a world-class emergency response.
Located at our headquarters in Calgary, Canada, the Safety Operations Center incorporates state-of-the-art infrastructure, including redundancy of power supply, communications and computing. We monitor over 7,500 devices world-wide, around-the-clock.
Monitoring personnel manage safety and gas detection alerts in real-time from receipt through to resolution by following the customer's tailored and documented emergency response protocol. Should an emergency take place, our Safety Operations Center is empowered to dispatch local emergency services across North America. Emergency responders are directed to the precise location of the employee in distress.
With 99.5% of alerts responded to in under a minute, Blackline's Safety Monitoring Center facilitates worry-free monitoring services and support, so employees can take comfort knowing their safety is always covered.
