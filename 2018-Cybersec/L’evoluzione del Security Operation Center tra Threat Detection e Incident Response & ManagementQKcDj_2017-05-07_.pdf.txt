Is your security team prepared?

Broad Attacks
Indiscriminate malware, spam and DoS activity
Tactical Approach
Compliance-driven, reactionary
 Build multiple perimeters  Protect all systems  Use signature-based methods  Periodically scan for known threats  Read the latest news  Shut down systems

Targeted Attacks
Advanced, persistent, organized, politically or financially motivated
Strategic Approach
Intelligence-driven, continuous
 Assume constant compromise  Prioritize high-risk assets  Use behavioral-based methods  Continuously monitor activity  Consume real-time threat feeds  Gather, preserve, retrace evidence

New threats require a new approach to security, but most are defending
against yesterday's attacks, using siloed, discrete defenses

What is a Security Operations Center, or SOC?
A Security Operations Center is a highly skilled team following defined definitions and processes to manage threats and reduce security risk.
Security Operations Centers (SOC) are designed to:
· protect mission-critical data and assets · prepare for and respond to cyber emergencies · help provide continuity and efficient recovery · fortify the business infrastructure
The SOC's major responsibilities are:
· Monitor, Analyze, Correlate & Escalate Intrusion Events · Develop Appropriate Responses; Protect, Detect, Respond · Conduct Incident Management and Forensic Investigation · Maintain Security Community Relationships · Assist in Crisis Operations

A Security Operations Center is key to keeping up with a perpetually evolving cyber security environment

1 Manage risk

Objectives

2 Meet compliance and regulatory requirements

3 Safeguard critical data

4 Protect business against attacks
5 Increase cyber security visibility

6 Move from reactive response to proactive mitigation

To achieve these objectives, IBM Security looks at the whole span of the threat management lifecycle
Threat management lifecycle

Strategize

Collect

Analyze

Prioritize

Respond

Prevent

Assess security posture and capabilities
Where can I begin or improve?

Gather and process threat
data
What threats
am I facing?

Analyze, correlate, score
and filter

Rank, prioritize and measure

Operationalize and respond

Track, learn and integrate into the
organization

What do they mean
to me?

Which are `high value'
threats?

How should I respond?

How can I prevent it in the future?

Enterprise risk management data platform
Ongoing optimization

Cybersecurity Incident Response Planning

 An incident response plan is the

foundation on which all incident response

and recovery activities are based:

 It provides a framework for effectively responding to any number of potential incidents
 It specifically defines the organization, roles and responsibilities of the computer security incident response ream (CSIRT)

CSIRP Review and
Gap Assessment

 It should have criteria to assist an organization determine types and priorities of each security incident

CSIRP Development

 It defines escalation and communication procedures to management, executive, legal, law enforcement, and media depending on incident conditions and severity

Incident Mock Tests and
Table Top Exercise

 It must be regularly updated and fully tested via dry runs

1CSIRP = Computer Security Incident Response Plan
