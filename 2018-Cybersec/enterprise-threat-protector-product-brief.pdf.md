AKAMAI CLOUD SECURITY SOLUTIONS: PRODUCT BRIEF
ENTERPRISE THREAT PROTECTOR
Targeted Threat Protection in the Cloud

The enterprise threat landscape is fast evolving. Targeted threats such as malware, ransomware, data exfiltration, and phishing are increasing in volume, and malicious actors are getting better at circumventing traditional security approaches. Combined with the adoption of SaaS, Cloud, and IoT in the enterprise, more sophisticated threat delivery has introduced new visibility challenges, control-point complications, and security gaps. Powered by Akamai's unique global insights into Internet and Domain Name System (DNS) traffic, Enterprise Threat Protector enables security teams to proactively block and mitigate targeted threats and enforce an acceptable use policy across the enterprise.

ENTERPRISE THREAT PROTECTOR Built on the Akamai Intelligent PlatformTM and Akamai's AnswerXTM carrier-grade recursive DNS, Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) is a quick-to-configure and easy-to-deploy cloud solution that requires no hardware or software to deploy or maintain.
Enterprise Threat Protector leverages real-time Akamai Cloud Security Intelligence and Akamai's proven, globally distributed recursive DNS platform to proactively identify and block targeted threats such as malware, ransomware, DNS data exfiltration, and phishing. Akamai's cloud portal enables security teams to centrally manage and enforce unified security and acceptable use policies in minutes for all employees.
HOW IT WORKS The Domain Name System (DNS) is the foundation for all Internet services, yet many malicious domains, including sites hosting malware and ransomware, and the associated command and control (CnC) servers, use recursive DNS for attacks.
When an enterprise's external recursive DNS traffic is directed to Akamai's Enterprise Threat Protector, requested domains are checked against Akamai's real-time domain risk scoring threat intelligence, and enterprises can proactively block employees from accessing malicious domains and services. As this validation happens before the IP connection is made, threats are stopped earlier in the security kill chain, i.e., farther away from an enterprise's perimeter. In addition, DNS is effective across all ports and protocols, thus protecting against malware that does not use standard web ports and protocols.
Domains can also be checked to determine the type of content an employee is attempting to access, and blocked if the content breaches the enterprise's acceptable use policy (AUP).
Beta - Deploying the lightweight Enterprise Security Connector on managed laptops also lets companies quickly add an additional layer of proactive security when laptops are used off network.
Enterprise Threat Protector easily integrates with other security products and reporting tools -- including Secure Web Gateways, Next-Generation Firewalls, and SIEMs, as well as external threat intelligence feeds -- allowing companies to maximize their investments across all layers of their security stack.

AKAMAI CLOUD SECURITY SOLUTIONS: PRODUCT BRIEF

AKAMAI CLOUD SECURITY INTELLIGENCE (CSI) Enterprise Threat Protector is powered by Akamai's Cloud Security Intelligence, which delivers real-time intelligence about malicious domains and the risks that these domains present to enterprises.

KEY CAPABILITIES · Akamai-Categorized Threats: Up-to-the-minute threat intelligence
based on Akamai's visibility into 15­30% of daily web traffic is combined with 150 billion daily DNS requests to Akamai's recursive DNS cloud.

This intelligence is built on data gathered every day from Akamai's Intelligent Platform, which manages up to 30% of global web traffic and delivers up to 150 billion DNS queries daily. Akamai's intelligence is enhanced with external threat feeds, and the combined data set is analyzed using advanced behavioral analysis. These results are further enhanced by a dedicated threat research team. As new threats are identified, they are immediately added to the ETP service, delivering real-time protection for enterprises and their employees.
AKAMAI'S INTELLIGENT PLATFORM The Enterprise Threat Protector service is built on Akamai's carrier-grade Intelligent Platform, which is secure, reliable, and fast. Distributed globally, the platform delivers a 100% availability SLA and ensures optimal reliability for an enterprise's recursive DNS service.
CLOUD-BASED MANAGEMENT PORTAL All configuration and ongoing management of Enterprise Threat Protector is done through Akamai's cloud-based Luna portal, enabling management to be done from any location at any time.
Policy management is quick and easy. Changes can be pushed out globally in minutes to ensure that all enterprise locations and employees are protected. Email alerts can be configured to signal security teams about critical policy events so that immediate remediation steps can be taken to quickly identify and resolve potential threats. A real-time dashboard provides an overview of DNS traffic, threat events, and AUP activities. Detailed information on any activity can be viewed through drilldown on individual dashboard elements. This detailed information provides a valuable resource for analysis and remediation of security incidents.

· Customer-Categorized Threats: Security teams can quickly integrate existing threat intelligence feeds, extending value from your existing security investments.
· Acceptable Use Policies: Enforce enterprise acceptable use policy and ensure compliance by limiting which content categories can and cannot be accessed.
· Analysis and Reporting: Dashboards provide real-time insight into all outbound enterprise DNS traffic, as well as threat and AUP events.
· Logging: DNS logs are retained for 7 days (Beta - 30 days) and can easily exported as a CSV file or integrated into a SIEM for further analysis.
· DNSSEC: All DNS requests sent to Enterprise Threat Protector have DNSSEC enabled.
