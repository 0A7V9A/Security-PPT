EMERGING SECURITY CHALLENGES

Today's Network Is Borderless
IoT and the cloud have expanded the attack surface- the "edge" is no longer clearly defined. There are more ways in and more ways out.

Slow Is Broken
Security has become a bottleneck; enterprises compromise security features to achieve performance goals.

Complexity Is the Enemy of Security
Too many point solutions create security gaps and a slow response to threats; no communication or coordination.

THE FORTINET SECURITY FABRIC
THIRD-GENERATION NETWORK SECURITY

BROAD
The Fabric covers the entire attack surface--security can be applied to the network, endpoints, access, applications, and cloud, and visibility extended to other vendor solutions.
POWERFUL
The Security Fabric utilizes security processors to reduce the burden on infrastructure, allowing comprehensive security without affecting performance.
AUTOMATED
The Security Fabric enables a fast and coordinated response to threats--all elements can rapidly exchange threat intelligence and coordinate actions.
