Anomaly Detection Make sure all IoT devices still work as originally design.
Vulnerability Detection & Virtual Patch Understand whether IoT devices were exposed to the latest threats and take action to protect them.
Detail the cyber security status of the firmware.
Find an anomaly of IoT devices, track trends of the anomaly, and plan the next fix or take mitigate actions.
