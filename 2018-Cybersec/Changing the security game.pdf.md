FORCEPOINT'S APPROACH TO SECURITY

DATA EVERYWHERE

USERS ANYWHERE

MANY BEHAVIORS

Copyright © Forcepoint | 14

TODAY'S REALITY: THE ZERO-PERIMETER WORLD

Remote Users

Remote Users

1. Significantly increased attack surface
2. Lack of Visibility
You cannot secure what you cannot see
3. Disjointed Security Policy
From one perimeter to defend to many
4. Silo'd Intelligence & limited visibility to risk
Unable to make informed decisions for the entire business
5. Ineffective Enforcement
Unable to make informed decisions for the entire business
6. Compliance
Things just got a lot more complicated
