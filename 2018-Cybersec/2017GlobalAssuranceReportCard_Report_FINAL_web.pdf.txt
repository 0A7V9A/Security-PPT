2017 Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card
Research by CyberEdge Group

Introduction
While malware attacks and data breaches continue to make headlines almost daily, the world's information security professionals are facing radical shifts in the enterprise attack surface as we move into 2017. They still struggle with a lack of visibility and risk assessment for cloud, mobile, BYOD and shadow IT, but now must address a new layer of complexity as organizations embrace the world of DevOps and containers.
The Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card was created by Tenable Network Security to measure the attitudes, beliefs and perceptions of security professionals and discover whether or not the world's cyber defenses are meeting expectations.
By averaging responses from 700 security practitioners across seven key industry verticals and nine countries, Tenable and research partner CyberEdge Group derived two summary indices that reflect the abilities of the world's enterprises to assess cybersecurity risks and mitigate threats. These scores were combined to produce a single report card score that represents overall confidence levels of security practitioners that the world's cyber defenses are meeting expectations.

Executive Summary
The 2017 Tenable Network Security Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card picked up right where last year's study left off, with Risk Assessment for cloud and mobile ranking among the world's biggest enterprise security weaknesses. This year, however, accelerated adoption of cloud and mobile computing combined with the emergence of DevOps and containers to increase the complexity and decentralization of enterprise IT, are making it harder for security teams to see everything on their networks and accurately assess cyber risks.
With a modern enterprise network made up of mobile, cloud, web apps, virtual machines, internet of things, BYOD and containers the days of a well-defined network perimeter that can be secured and defended are long over. Today's network is ephemeral. The issue is not just one category of devices or apps and their individual risk, it is the totality of these assets and how they expand the corporate attack surface, creating new risk to an organization.
Complicated by the constantly evolving and multiplying threat landscape -- cited for the second year in a row as the number one challenge for security pros -- this heightened technological complexity is creating even more opportunity for attackers to exploit gaps in security coverage, leaving all organizations vulnerable to compromise and breach, regardless of the size of their security investments.
Indeed, the situation appears dire as the world enters 2017, with data reflecting an overall decline in global cyber readiness fueled by a pronounced inability to assess and mitigate cyber risks for the new and evolving IT landscape. It is more critical now than ever before that businesses and government organizations everywhere not only understand the threats aligned against them, but that they also possess a realistic assessment of their own cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses.
The following are some of the key takeaways from the 2017 report:
1 Risk Assessment Woe In 2016, respondents were asked to rate their organizations' ability to assess security risks associated with 10 different IT components. In 2017, corresponding scores fell by an average of 12 percentage points.
2 Cloud Darkening Cloud software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) were two of the lowest scoring Risk Assessment areas in the 2016 report. SaaS and IaaS were combined with platform as a service (PaaS) for the 2017 survey and the new "cloud environments" component scored 60% (D-), a seven point drop compared to last year's average for IaaS and SaaS.
3 A Mobile Morass Identified alongside IaaS and SaaS in last year's report as one of the biggest enterprise security weaknesses, Risk Assessment for mobile devices once again dropped eight points from 65% (D) to 57% (F).
4 New Challenges Emerge Two new IT components were introduced for 2017 -- containerization platforms and DevOps environments.

DevOps is transforming the way software teams collaborate through increased consistency and automation, but it also introduces new security concerns. In fact, respondents reported just 57% (F) confidence in the ability to assess security during the DevOps process.
At the same time, adoption of containerization technologies like Docker is exploding as organizations look to accelerate innovation cycles and reduce time-to-market. Unfortunately, only 52% (F) of respondents this year felt that their organization had a handle on how best to assess risks within container environments.
5 Web App Security: Room for Improvement? The single biggest drop in Risk Assessment this year is web applications, which fell 18 points from 80% (B-) in 2016 to 62% (D-) in 2017. The ability to access these services online and from mobile phones puts them right at users' fingertips, but also creates new security challenges. If application-centric security is the future, we have a long way to go.
6 Security Assurance Steady Although respondents struggled to assess risks in an evolving threat landscape, they expressed confidence in their ability to mitigate security risks, once identified. Despite changes to three of the six Security Assurance survey questions in 2017, the three scores that carried over from last year only fluctuated by a few percentage points.
7 India Claims the Top Spot New to the 2017 Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card, India debuted with the highest overall score at 84% (B), while last year's leader, the United States, fell two points to second place with 78% (C+).
8 Japan Lacking Confidence Another new addition for this year, Japan's information security pros reported the lowest of the nine countries with an overall score of 48% (F). Even after taking margin of error into account, Japanese security practitioners graded themselves quite harshly, putting the country firmly in last place behind Germany, which fell 10 points this year to 62% (D-).
9 Education and Government Behind the Pack Of the seven industries analyzed in the 2016 study, Education and Government earned the lowest overall scores. These two industries placed near the bottom again in the 2017 study, with Education remaining steady at 64% (D) and Government dropping three points to 63% (D).
10 Retail Takes the Lead Over Financial Services and Telecom Last year, Financial Services and Telecom tied for first place among industries surveyed with an overall report card score of 81% (B-). This year, six of the seven overall industry scores fell, with Telecom experiencing the most significant drop, down 11 points to 70% (C-) followed closely by Financial Services, down nine points to 72% (C-). Retail remained relatively steady, losing only one point to take first place with a 2017 score of 76% (C).
The remainder of this report provides detailed Risk Assessment Index and Security Assurance Index results and insights globally, by country and by industry -- followed by recommendations to help organizations improve their ability to minimize cybersecurity risks.

Risk Assessment Index
The Risk Assessment Index conveys an organization's ability to assess cybersecurity risks across 11 key IT infrastructure components, as depicted in question 6 of the survey instrument (see Appendix 3) and in Figures 1, 2, and 3 below. In 2017, "cloud apps" and "cloud infrastructure" were collapsed into "cloud environments." And two additional IT components were added, "containerization platforms" and "DevOps environments."
Figure 1 depicts the Risk Assessment score changes between 2016 and 2017, with the 2016 cloud infrastructure score stemming from the combination of cloud apps and cloud infrastructure in that same year.

As is evident in this year's results, information security professionals are more concerned today with their organizations' ability to assess security risks across nearly all facets of the IT infrastructure than they were last year.

The Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card is intended to measure the human IT landscape and was designed to gauge the attitudes and beliefs of IT security professionals, not the actual effectiveness of their security defenses. While it might be difficult to nail down any single cause, one thing is clear -- the overall decline in Risk Assessment confidence is real.

The marked decline in global confidence levels indicates that security professionals may be experiencing a drop in morale as a result of near-daily data breach headlines, compounded by fatigue as a result of the uphill battle to keep pace with emerging technologies and proliferating threats. Despite spending tens of billions of dollars on security products and services each year, organizations around the world continue to be affected by data breaches. And security professionals are wondering whether their organizations will be next, and are doubting their readiness despite feeling like they have the funding and tools they need (see Figure 10).

Of notable concern are the failing grades for containerization platforms (52%), DevOps environments (57%) and mobile devices (57%).

First, although containerization delivers numerous benefits, it also introduces new security risks, which are impossible to identify using traditional security tools. The rapid development and deployment of containers, combined with their relatively short life cycles, make it difficult for security teams to effectively monitor and detect container-based vulnerabilities.

Second, the emergence of DevOps processes in the world's enterprises has fundamentally changed the way security should be implemented. The goal of DevOps is to change and improve the relationship between development and operations to create a seamless and streamlined process; however, if security is not incorporated into the build cycle, it could be treated as an afterthought or cut out of the loop entirely. Similar to containerization, the use of DevOps platforms presents new risks that many organizations struggle to proactively identify and remediate.
Third, mobile devices continue to be a weak point for IT security professionals. Users want to access corporate applications and data using their personal tablets and smartphones, but implementing a bringyour-own-device (BYOD) policy can leave IT environments vulnerable, unless these devices are properly secured. IT security professionals continue to struggle with not only securing mobile devices, but also assessing their security risks.
The biggest Risk Assessment score drop in the 2017 report is web applications, which fell 18% this year (from 80% in 2016 to 62% in 2017). The ability to access these services online and from mobile phones puts them right at users' fingertips. From Google Docs and email to maps, games and news, applications are used to streamline productivity and stifle boredom. More alarming is what this could mean for the future. As confidence in the ability to secure web apps falls, the accelerating migration of IT operations and infrastructure to the cloud means the traditional approach to security must evolve beyond perimeter defenses and endpoint solutions, placing application security high on the list of critical priorities.
See Figure 2 below for a look at how each of the nine surveyed countries fared. Overall score changes from 2016 to 2017 for each country are depicted in the "Final Grades" section.

Security Assurance Index
The Security Assurance Index conveys an organization's ability to mitigate threats by investing in security infrastructure fueled by executive and board-level commitment. Questions 7-12 of the web-based survey (see Appendix 3) are associated with Security Assurance Index scores. Three of the six questions carried over from 2016 (questions 7, 11, and 12) while three questions are new (questions 8, 9, and 10).

Figure 4 depicts the global Security Assurance scores for 2016 and 2017, and the score changes for those three topics carried over from last year.

6 | 2017 Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card

Even with three new questions, the 2017 Security Assurance Index was relatively unchanged compared to last year. Security practitioners expressed the least confidence in their ability to aggregate risk intelligence at 73% (C). This is consistent with the findings that security practitioners struggle with accurately assessing risk posture across the enterprise.
The Security Assurance data also show that information security as a profession is maturing. Security pros are confident in their ability to measure security effectiveness at 83% (B) and also in their ability to convey risks to executives and the board -- 80% (B-). Despite confidence in their own abilities, security teams remain unimpressed with executive and board-level commitment, which was up just one point to 77% (C+) in 2017.
In almost every country, with the exception of Singapore, Security Assurance led Risk Assessment, with scores indicating that security teams feel comfortable measuring and reporting on what they know they can see, but acknowledge that there are critical gaps in security visibility -- a theme reflected later in this report (see Figure 10).

The Road Ahead
To provide additional insight into the mindset of security professionals, respondents were asked two questions not associated with the Risk Assessment or Security Assurance indices. The first question asked the following: "Compared to this time last year, do you feel more optimistic or pessimistic about your organization's ability to defend itself against cyber attacks?" The responses are depicted in Figure 9 below.
Significantly more optimistic, 22%

Significantly more pessimistic, 1.9% Somewhat more pessimistic, 7.5%

Somewhat more optimistic, 42.9% About the same, 25.6%

FIGURE 9: Optimism now versus one year ago for defending against cyber attacks
Optimism among IT security professionals in 2017 is similar to last year's findings. Despite the number of data breach headlines, and present concern about the inability to properly assess IT security risks brought on by new and emerging technologies, respondents are generally optimistic about the future, perhaps fueled by new investments in people and/or technology, and the concerted effort to make security a boardroom-level issue.
The second question posed the following: "On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest, rate each of the following challenges facing IT security professionals today." The results are depicted in Figure 10.

Overwhelming cyber threat environment Low security awareness among employees Lack of network visibility (BYOD, Shadow IT)
Shortage of qualified workers Lack of effective security products
Lack of budget Lack of effective reporting

16 | 2017 Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card

The top two most common responses -- overwhelming cyber threat environment and low security awareness among employees -- are the same top responses from last year. However, a new survey response, lack of network visibility, was added this year and was the third biggest challenge for organizations.
There's no question that BYOD and shadow IT cause headaches among security professionals. Both trends bring unapproved and nonsecure devices onto corporate networks, making it nearly impossible for security teams to detect them. Both scenarios bring substantial risk to an already risk-heavy environment.
Based off the findings of the 2017 Global Cybersecurity Assurance Report Card, what can security professionals and organizations, alike, do to improve their Risk Assessment and Security Assessment scores? Here are some suggestions to get started:
1 Know Yourself You can't secure what you can't see. These days this not only means having continuous visibility into cloud, hybrid and on-premises environments, but organizations also have to stay ahead of security challenges that accompany new trends and technologies.
This year, visibility is more important than ever. Now, alongside cloud, mobile, BYOD and shadow IT, DevOps and containerization are forcing security pros to once again re-think the approach to information security.
Continuous visibility equals rapid detection of threats and vulnerabilities, which is why active scanning -- even if frequent -- is no longer enough. Organizations need passive vulnerability scanning and log correlation to achieve true continuous and pervasive monitoring. The combination of active, passive and log/ event correlation drastically reduces the attack surface and helps detect threats faster and with greater accuracy by continuously uncovering and tracking users, applications, cloud environments, and mobile devices. This also allows organizations to perform continuous vulnerability assessment across all network assets.
2 Define and Convey Success With nation-state cyber attacks and massive data breaches in the news every day, cybersecurity is now firmly in the spotlight and security pros are being held accountable to the business in ways they haven't before. As the cybersecurity industry matures, there are higher expectations for security teams to contribute meaningfully to board-level decision making. Knowing themselves is a good start, but today's security teams must also be able to convey that sense of self to others.

This year's survey results show executive and board-level commitment lagging behind the abilities of the world's security professionals to measure security effectiveness and convey risks up the chain. Executive-level reporting on organizational risk posture enables the kind of informed decision making senior business leaders need to meet the technology challenges of tomorrow. Having the right metrics is crucial to convincing senior executives that cybersecurity should be taken as a high-level business concern, but it is up to the security practitioners to make these metrics readily available and easily digestible for people without in-depth security expertise.
3 A Balanced Approach to Security Threats evolve and most security vendors have been slow to adapt. There is a better way, one that is simpler and more intuitive, and can help organizations achieve security balance with less resources.
The days of buying and managing 80 or 90 "best-of-breed" layered security products from dozens of different vendors are over. Organizations need a balanced approach to security investment with solutions that -- even if from different vendors -- are still part of a security ecosystem where everything works together -- seamlessly and intelligently -- to deliver comprehensive protection from threats and vulnerabilities and, through risk prioritization and actionable insights, helps answer the question: "What can I do right now to improve security for my organization today?"

Appendix 2: Research Methodology
CyberEdge Group developed a 12-question web-based survey instrument in partnership with Tenable Network Security. The survey was promoted to information security professionals across nine countries and three geographic regions -- United States and Canada (North America), United Kingdom, Germany, and France (Europe), and Australia, Singapore, Japan, and India (Asia Pacific). The survey was translated for all non-English-speaking target audiences.
The online survey was conducted in October 2016. Each respondent met two demographic requirements: (1) employed for an organization with 1,000+ employees globally and (2) held an IT security position (i.e., not an IT generalist). Respondents that failed to meet either of these criteria were exited from the survey.
Sample Sizes
Respondents were derived from 19 industries and nine countries. Each country and industry referenced in this report included a minimum of 25 responses. Responses from industries with fewer than 25 responses were reported in the aggregate, globally and by country.
The following are sample sizes by geography in decreasing order:
 Global: 700 (100%)  United States: 270 (38.6%)  United Kingdom: 75 (10.7%)  Germany: 75 (10.7%)  France: 75 (10.7%)  Australia: 50 (7.1%)  Singapore: 50 (7.1%)  Japan: 50 (7.1%)  Canada: 30 (4.3%)  India: 25 (3.6%)
The following are sample sizes by industry in decreasing order:
 Manufacturing: 101 (14.4%)  Telecom, Technology, Internet, and Electronics: 101 (14.4%)  Finance & Financial Services: 66 (9.4%)  Retail & Consumer Durables: 49(7.0%)  Health Care & Pharmaceuticals: 45 (6.4%)  Government: 37 (5.3%)  Education: 36 (5.1%)

Analysis
Each score was derived by adding together the percentages of the two most-favorable responses of associated questions. Risk Assessment scores are associated with 11 IT components depicted in question 6 (see Appendix 3). Security Assurance scores are associated with questions 7-12.
Typical American grades were assigned to each index score (along with international grades for high-level index scores for non-U.S. countries) using the following scale:

GRADE A+ A AB+ B BC+ C CD+ D DF

RANGE 100%
93-99% 90-92% 87-89% 83-86% 80-82% 77-79% 73-76% 70-72% 67-69% 63-66% 60-62% < 60%

Quality Control
Each (non-demographic) survey question included a "Don't know" response, minimizing the potential for respondents to over-reach by answering questions outside their respective areas of expertise or responsibility. All findings within this report were derived after "Don't know" response counts were excluded, thus slightly decreasing the sample size of responses for each question by country and industry.
All qualified survey responses were inspected for potential survey "cheaters," meaning survey takers that responded to questions in a consistent pattern (e.g., all "A" responses, repeating A-B-C-A-B-C responses) and/or completed the survey in a fraction of the median survey completion time in an attempt to complete the survey quickly. Suspected cheater survey responses were deleted from the pool of responses.
