Cyber threats and cyber crime are on the rise. Criminals are exploiting the complexity of our expanding networks to infect, steal data, and hold systems to ransom. Extensive research and knowledge of the threat landscape, combined with the ability to respond quickly at multiple levels, is imperative for providing effective security.
FortiGuard security services are designed to optimize performance and maximize protection across Fortinet's security platforms and are available as subscription feeds for the FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall / IPS platforms, the FortiMail secure email gateway, the FortiClient endpoint protection software, FortiSandbox, FortiCache, and the FortiWeb web application firewall. This includes IP reputation updates, intrusion prevention, web filtering, antivirus/anti-spyware, anti-spam, database security, and network and web application control capabilities to enable unified protection against today's threats.

Intelligence Illumination
By leveraging global threat data, enterprise organizations will be able to outsmart highly complex attacks. It Is important to understand the capabilities, tactics and procedures of cyber threat actors. With possession of this kind of information, enterprises have enough "illumination" to understand how to better respond to threats that are targeting their organization. It is this information that would ultimately illuminate the path to a stronger cybersecurity posture within your organization.
Combat Threats
By combining our threat intelligence feed with local data from your network, such as logs and security events from your infrastructure, you will be able to quickly remediate threats with a surgical precision, lessening the time to respond to threats and saving valuable security personnel time. Threats arise from everywhere on the globe, and a threat that has first appeared in Japan for instance, could be targeting a corporation in Europe tomorrow. By having information about what may happen tomorrow, your organization will be gaining pro-active, intelligent based protection to stay ahead of threats.
