MOBILE CLASSIFIER ­ DATA CLASSIFICATION FOR THE WIDEST RANGE OF MOBILE PLATFORMS

Whilst enterprise mobility brings many benefits, it comes with an increased risk to sensitive data resulting from personal and corporate data being accessed from the same device.
Although many organisations recognise the importance of data classification as part of a layered security approach, mobile devices aren't always covered and you need to ensure your sensitive business data is safe from loss or leakage, no matter how or where your employees choose to access it.
Boldon James Mobile Classifier protects business data consistently across a diverse range of mobile platforms, allowing organisations to exploit the benefits of enterprise mobility without the accompanying risks.

Mobile Classifier extends message classification to handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets, providing a consistent classification experience to the widest range of mobile platforms, including iOS, Android and Windows Phone.
By separating personal and business data, Mobile Classifier enables organisations to prevent email mishandling and reduce the likelihood of data leakage. As with other Classifier products, Mobile Classifier adds relevant visual and metadata markings to email messages, ensuring consistent actions by complementary security solutions such as Encryption, Data Loss Prevention and Digital Rights Management. It can also be flexibly deployed, with both on-premises and cloud mailbox solutions such as Microsoft Office 365.
