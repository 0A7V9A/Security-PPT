Foreword
The global community is increasingly embracing ICTs as key enabler for social and economic development. Governments across the world recognize that digital transformation has the power to further the prosperity and wellbeing of their citizens. In supporting this transformation, they also recognize that cybersecurity must be an integral and indivisible part of technological progress. In 2016, nearly one percent of all emails sent were essentially malicious attacks, the highest rate in recent years. Ransomware attacks increasingly affected businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing out massive volumes of malicious emails. Attackers are demanding more and more from victims, with the average ransom demand rising to over 1,000 USD in 2016, up from approximately 300 USD a year earlier. In May 2017, a massive cyberattack caused major disruptions to companies and hospitals in over 150 countries, prompting a call for greater cooperation around the world. First launched in 2014, the goal of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is to help foster a global culture of cybersecurity and its integration at the core of ICTs. This second iteration of the GCI measures the commitment of ITU Member States towards cybersecurity in order to drive further efforts in the adoption and integration of cybersecurity on a global scale. The GCI reaffirms ITU's commitment to build confidence and security in the use of ICTs. This report on the second iteration of the GCI continues to show the cybersecurity commitment of ITU Member States around the world, and I am pleased to note that the overall picture shows improvement and strengthening of the global cybersecurity agenda. I wish to thank Member States for their contribution to this effort. The collection of information for the GCI is an ongoing process, and I therefore invite all ITU Member States to continue sending and updating information on their cybersecurity efforts so that we can effectively share experiences, views and solutions in order to make the digital world a more secure and safe environment for all citizens.

Executive Summary
The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is a survey that measures the commitment of Member States to cybersecurity in order to raise awareness. The GCI revolves around the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA) and its five pillars (legal, technical, organizational, capacity building and cooperation). For each of these pillars, questions were developed to assess commitment. Through consultation with a group of experts, these questions were weighted in order to arrive at an overall GCI score. The survey was administered through an online platform through which supporting evidence was also collected. One-hundred and thirty-four Member States responded to the survey throughout 2016. Member States who did not respond were invited to validate responses determined from open-source research. As such, the GCI results reported herein cover all 193 ITU Member States. The 2017 publication of the GCI continues to show the commitment to cybersecurity of countries around the world. The overall picture shows improvement and strengthening of all five elements of the cybersecurity agenda in various countries in all regions. However, there is space for further improvement in cooperation at all levels, capacity building and organizational measures. As well, the gap in the level of cybersecurity engagement between different regions is still present and visible. The level of development of the different pillars varies from country to country in the regions, and while commitment in Europe remains very high in the legal and technical fields in particular, the challenging situation in the Africa and Americas regions shows the need for continued engagement and support. In addition to providing the GCI score, this report also provides a set of illustrative practices that give insight into the achievements of certain countries.

Global Cybersecurity Index 2017
1 Introduction
The information and communication technologies (ICT) networks, devices and services are increasingly critical for day-to-day life. In 2016, almost half the world used the Internet (3.5 billion users)1 and according to one estimate, there will be over 12 billion machine-to-machine devices connected to the Internet by 20202. Yet, just as in the real world, the cyber world is exposed to a variety of security threats that can cause immense damage. Statistics on threats to computer networks are sobering and reflect a shift from the relatively innocuous spam of yesteryear to threats that are more malicious. A security company tracking incidents in 2016 found that malicious emails became a weapon of choice for a wide range of cyberattacks during the year used by everyone from state sponsored cyber espionage groups to mass-mailing ransomware gangs. One-in-131 emails sent were malicious, the highest rate in five years. Ransomware continues to plague businesses and consumers, with indiscriminate campaigns pushing out massive volumes of malicious emails. In some cases, organizations can be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of ransomware-laden emails they receive. Attackers are demanding more and more from victims with the average ransom demand in 2016 rising to USD 1 077, up from USD 294 a year earlier3. The scale of cybercrime makes it critical for governments to have a robust cybersecurity ecosystem in place to reduce threats and enhance confidence in using electronic communications and services. It is therefore clear that there is a direct cause-effect principle between the growth of ICTs and their illicit and malicious use. To counter this effect, cybersecurity is becoming more and more relevant in the minds of countries' decision makers, and cybersecurity related doctrines have been established in almost all countries in the world. However, there is still an evident gap between countries in terms of awareness, understanding, knowledge and finally capacity to deploy the proper strategies, capabilities and programmes to ensure a safe and appropriate use of ICTs as enablers for economic development. In this context, ITU, together with international partners from private-public and private sector as well as academia, has established the GCI with the key objective of building capacity at the national, regional and international level, through assessing the level of engagement of countries on cybersecurity, and, with the data gathered, producing a list of good practices that can be used by countries in need.

Global Cybersecurity Index 2017
2 GCI Scope and Framework
2.1 Background
The GCI is included under Resolution 130 (Rev. Busan, 2014) on strengthening the role of ITU in building confidence and security in the use of ICT. Specifically, Member States are invited "to support ITU initiatives on cybersecurity, including the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), in order to promote government strategies and the sharing of information on efforts across industries and sectors".
A first iteration of the GCI was conducted in 2013-2014 in partnership with ABI Research1, and the final results have been published2.
Following feedback received from various communities, a second iteration of the GCI was planned and undertaken. This new version was formulated around an extended participation from Member States, experts and industry stakeholders as contributing partners (namely World Bank and Red Team Cyber as new GCI partners joining the Australia Strategic Policy Institute, FIRST, Indiana University, INTERPOL, ITU-Arab Regional Cybersecurity Centre in Oman, Korea Internet & Security Agency, NTRA Egypt, The Potomac Institute of Policy Studies, UNICRI, University of Technology Jamaica and UNODC) who all provided support with the provision of secondary data, response activation, statistical analysis, qualitative appreciation amongst other.
The data collected via GCI 2017 for ITU-D Study Group 2 Question 3 (SG2Q3) surveys have been analysed by the Rapporteur and co-Rapporteur for inclusion in the SG2Q3 final report. GCI partners have been active in providing expertise and secondary data as appropriate, while the UN office of ICT (New York) has also initiated collaborative work. ITU is also working in a multi-stakeholder collaboration led by the World Bank to elaborate a toolkit on "Best practice in Policy/Legal enabling Framework and Capacity Building in Combatting Cybercrime". ITU is providing support on the component on capacity building from a cybersecurity perspective based on GCI 2017 data.
An enhanced reference model was thereby devised. Throughout the steps of this new version, Member States were consulted using various vehicles including ITUD Study Group 2 Question 3/2, where the overall project was submitted, discussed and validated.
2.2 Reference model
The GCI is a composite index combining 25 indicators into one benchmark measure to monitor and compare the level of ITU Member States cybersecurity commitment with regard to the five pillars identified by the High-Level Experts Group and endorsed by the GCA. These pillars form the five pillars of GCI.
The main objectives of the GCI are to measure:
· the type, level and evolution over time of cybersecurity commitment in countries and relative to other countries;
· the progress in cybersecurity commitment of all countries from a global perspective;
· the progress in cybersecurity commitment from a regional perspective; · the cybersecurity commitment divide, i.e. the difference between countries in terms of their
level of engagement in cybersecurity programmes and initiatives.

Global Cybersecurity Index 2017
The objective of the GCI as an initiative is to help countries identify areas for improvement in the field of cybersecurity, as well as to motivate them to take action to improve their ranking, thus helping raise the overall level of commitment to cybersecurity worldwide. Through the information collected, the GCI aims to illustrate the practices of other countries so that Member States can implement selected aspects suitable to their national environment, with the added benefits of helping harmonize practices and fostering, a global culture of cybersecurity.
2.3 Conceptual framework
The five pillars of the GCI are briefly explained below: 1. Legal: Measured based on the existence of legal institutions and frameworks dealing with
cybersecurity and cybercrime. 2. Technical: Measured based on the existence of technical institutions and frameworks dealing
with cybersecurity. 3. Organizational: Measured based on the existence of policy coordination institutions and
strategies for cybersecurity development at the national level. 4. Capacity Building: Measured based on the existence of research and development, education
and training programmes; certified professionals and public sector agencies fostering capacity building. 5. Cooperation: Measured based on the existence of partnerships, cooperative frameworks and information sharing networks.

Global Cybersecurity Index 2017
Each pillar was then further divided in sub-pillars (Figure 2.3.1). Figure 2.3.1: GCI pillars and sub-pillars
The questionnaire was elaborated on the basis of these sub-pillars 3. The values for the 25 indicators were therefore constructed through 157 binary questions. This was done in order to achieve the required level of granularity and ensure accuracy and quality on the answers.

3 Methodology
The GCI includes 25 indicators and 157 questions. The indicators used to calculate the GCI were selected on the basis of the following criteria:
· relevance to the five GCA pillars and in contributing towards the main GCI objectives and conceptual framework;
· data availability and quality; · possibility of cross verification through secondary data. The whole concept of a new iteration of the GCI is based on a cybersecurity development tree map and binary answer possibilities.
The tree map concept, which is illustrated in Figures 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, is an example of different possible paths that might be taken by countries in order to enhance their cybersecurity commitment.
Each of the five pillars are associated with a specific colour. The deeper the path taken, indicating a more developed level of commitment, the deeper the colour depicting it becomes.
The various levels of cybersecurity development among countries, as well as the different cybersecurity needs reflected by a country's overall ICT development status, were taken into consideration. The concept is based on the assumption that the more developed cybersecurity is, the more complex the solutions observed will be. Therefore, the further a country goes along the tree map by confirming the presence of preidentified cyber solutions, the more complex and sophisticated the cybersecurity commitment is within that country, allowing it to obtain a higher score with the GCI.
The rationale behind using binary answer possibilities is the elimination of opinion-based evaluation and of any possible bias towards certain types of answers.
Moreover, the simple binary concept will allow quicker and more complex evaluation as it will not require lengthy answers from countries. This, in turn, is assumed to accelerate and streamline the process of providing answers and further evaluation. The idea is that the respondent will only confirm the presence or lack of certain preidentified cybersecurity solutions. An online survey mechanism, which was used for gathering answers and uploading all relevant materials, enabled the extraction of good practices.
The key difference in methodology between GCI 2014 and GCI Version 2017 is the use of a binary system instead of a three-level system. The binary system evaluates the existence or absence of a specific activity, department or measure. Unlike GCI Version 2014, it does not take 'partial' measures into consideration. The facility for respondents to upload supporting documents and URLs is a way of providing more information to substantiate the binary response. Furthermore, a number of new questions have been added in each of the five pillars in order to refine the depth of research.
The GCI 2014 and GCI 2017 are not directly comparable due to a change in methodology. While the 2014 index used a simple average methodology, the 2017 index employs a weighting factor for each pillar.
The questionnaire, made available through an online survey from January to September 2016, was administered to the 193 ITU Member States (plus State of Palestine) in the regions of Africa, Americas, Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Europe. 134 countries responded to the online survey while 59 countries did not provide primary data.

The data collection process was implemented as follows:
1. A Letter of Invitation was sent by the ITU Secretariat to all Member States, informing them on the initiative and requesting the identification of a country level GCI focal point with whom ITU could liaise and who would be responsible for collecting all relevant data for completing the online GCI questionnaire. A guideline to the online questionnaire which provided explanations and examples for each question, was attached to the letter 1.
2. Primary data collection (for countries who responded to the questionnaire):
· Verification of the responses received by the specific Member State to identify possible missing elements (no or missing responses, no or missing supporting documents, no or missing links, etc.).
­ For instance, if a Member State answered "No", ITU researched to prove that they do not have any documents in the ITU database or online.
­ If a Member State answered "Yes", ITU researched to verify that answers provided were correct and corresponded to the question.
· The focal point identified by the concerned Member State was contacted and provided with indications on how to improve the accuracy of the responses. Where necessary ITU provided comments and guidance to improve the completed questionnaire.
· After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the concerned Member State for final approval.
· Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used for the analysis, scoring and ranking.
3. Secondary data collection (for countries that did not respond to the questionnaire):
· ITU elaborated an initial draft of the response to the questionnaire using publicly available data and online research.
· The draft was then sent to the concerned Member State for review.
· The reviewed response received, the focal point identified by the concerned Member State was contacted and provided with indications on how to improve the accuracy of the responses. Where necessary ITU provided comments and guidance to improve the completed questionnaire.
· After the necessary rounds of iterations, the pre-final questionnaire was sent back to the concerned Member State for final approval.

Global Cybersecurity Index 2017
· Once formal approval was received, the questionnaire was considered validated and used for the analysis, scoring and ranking.
The GCI 2017 methodology encompassed the use of a panel of experts, identified according to their specific expertise on the subject, who acted in their personal capacity in order to provide an expert view on the weighting to be used for the scoring.

4 Key Findings
4.1 Heat Map of National Cybersecurity Commitments
Out of the 193 Member States, there is a huge range in cybersecurity commitments, as the heat map below illustrates. Level of commitment: from Green (highest) to Red (lowest) Figure 4.1.1: GCI Heat Map
4.2 GCI Groups
Member States were classified into three categories by their GCI score (Figure 4.2.1). · Initiating stage refers to the 96 countries (i.e., GCI score less than the 50th percentile) that have
started to make commitments in cybersecurity. · Maturing stage refers to the 77 countries (i.e., GCI score between the 50th and 89th percentile)
that have developed complex commitments, and engage in cybersecurity programmes and initiatives. · Leading stage refers to the 21 countries (i.e., GCI score in the 90th percentile) that demonstrate high commitment in all five pillars of the index.

5 Global Outlook
All of the six ITU regions are represented in the top ten commitment level in the GCI. There are three from Asia and the Pacific, two each from Europe and the Americas, and one from Africa, the Arab States, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
This suggests that being highly committed is not strictly tied to geographic location.

As the GCI shows, there is a wide gulf in cyber preparedness around the globe. This gap exists between and within regions.
Further, cybersecurity related commitments are often unequally distributed with countries performing well in some pillars and less so in others. Cybersecurity is an ecosystem where laws, organizations, skills, cooperation and technical implementation need to be in harmony to be most effective.
Additionally, cybersecurity is not just a concern of the government but also needs commitment from the private sector and consumers. Thus, it is important to develop a cybersecurity culture where citizens are aware of the trade-off between risks and monitoring when using electronic networks.

5.1 Noteworthy figures
The GCI consists of 25 different indicators. Some relate to precise commitments that help to concretize the status of specific cybersecurity activities throughout the world.
One of the strongest commitments is to outline a cybersecurity strategy describing how the country will prepare and respond to attacks against its digital networks. Only 38% countries have a published cybersecurity strategy and only 11% have a dedicated standalone strategy (Figure 5.1.1, left); another 12% have a cybersecurity strategy under development.
More effort is needed in this critical area, particularly since it conveys that the government considers digital risks high priority. In the area of training, efforts need to be enhanced particularly for those who are most likely going to legally handle cybersecurity crimes given that less than half the Member States (43%) have capacity-building programmes for law enforcement and the judicial system (Figure 5.1.1, right).

Figure 5.1.1: Cybersecurity strategy and training commitments
Despite half of the Member States not having a cybersecurity strategy, 61% do have an emergency response team (i.e., CIRT, CSRIT, and CERT) with national responsibility (Figure 5.1.2, left). However, just over a fifth (21%) publish metrics on cybersecurity incidents (Figure 5.1.2, right). This makes it difficult in most countries to objectively assess incidents based on the evidence and determine if protection measures are working. Figure 5.1.2: Computer emergency response teams and metrics
Just less than a third of countries (32%) replied affirmatively to the existence of a homegrown cybersecurity industry (Figure 5.1.3, left). More efforts need to be devoted to this area as a local industry will have knowledge of national circumstances and make the security ecosystem more sustainable. The potential for global cooperation is heightened by participation in international cybersecurity events. This is almost universal with 95% of countries replying affirmatively (Figure 5.1.3, right).

5.2 Comparing GCI with other indices
A qualitative comparison has been performed to raise awareness on the importance of investing on cybersecurity, as an integral component of any national ICT for development strategy. This paragraph is not intended to provide thorough, exhaustive statistical analysis, but rather an indication on how cybersecurity can relate to existing national processes, in order to emphasize the importance of investing and being committed. Comparing GCI scores to notable ICT for Development Indices does not reveal an especially close relationship as experience shows that countries which score high in term of ICT for Development do not necessarily invest in cybersecurity with the same level of commitment, and vice versa. For example, comparing the GCI with the ITU ICT for Development Index (IDI), shows that some countries are performing much better in the GCI than their level of ICT development would suggest. The following figures show the relation between the GCI and IDI with each graph identifying the top three countries for each region.

6 Regional Outlook
During the active data collection phase of the GCI 2017 exercise, there was a varied response from countries in the ITU regions: · Out of the 44 Member States in the Africa region, 29 responded to the survey. · Out of 35 Member States in the Americas region, 23 responded to the survey · Out of 21 Member States in the Arab States region, 17 including the State of Palestine responded
to the survey. · Out of 38 Member States in the Asia and the Pacific region, 25 responded to the survey · Out of the 12 Member States in the Commonwealth of Independent States region, 7 responded
to the survey · Out of 43 Member States in the Europe region, 34 responded to the survey. Figure 6.1 illustrates the average GCI score for all countries in a particular region for the respective pillar. Scores that fall below the 33rd percentile have a red background, scores that are between the 33rd to 65th percentiles have a yellow background and scores that lie above the 65th percentile have a green background. There is scope for improvement since most regions have an average score for the different pillars (i.e., lying between 33rd and 65th percentiles). The exception is Europe, where average scores are high across all pillars. The Africa region averages low scores for the organizational pillar while the Commonwealth of Independent States region averages a high score for the legal pillar. The following sub-sections show the findings for each individual ITU region, highlighting the results and findings for the three top-scoring countries in each region. As well, a "regional scorecard" summarizes the countries' level of commitment to every pillar and sub-pillars (green for high, yellow for medium, and red for low).

7 Illustrative practices by pillar
This chapter identifies noteworthy and thought-provoking practices in cybersecurity across the various GCI pillars. Examples are drawn from a number of countries and provide an insight on the cybersecurity commitment taken in their focus areas.
7.1 Legal
Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in national cybercrime legislation regarding unauthorized access, data and system interference or interception, and misuse of computer systems.
7.1.1 Cybercrime legislation
Colombia became one of the first countries in the world when, in 2009, it enacted a law specifically targeting cyberspace. Law 1273 (entitled "By means of which the Penal Code is amended, a new legal right is created- called 'protection of information and data`- and systems that use information and communication technologies are fully preserved, among other provisions"1) calls for a prison sentence or large fines for anyone convicted of information systems or telecommunication network crimes. The law covers areas such as illegally accessing personal information, intercepting data, destroying data or using malicious software.
Georgia established cybercrime legislation in line with the principles and rules of the Budapest Convention both in terms of substantive and procedural aspects. Illegal access to information systems, data and system interference, and misuse of devices are criminalized by the Georgia criminal code. The Personal Data Protection Act was enacted by Parliament in 2011 and is intended to ensure protection of human rights and freedoms, including the right to privacy, in the course of personal data processing.2
7.1.2 Cybersecurity regulation
Sultanate of Oman established the eGovernance Framework, a set of standards / best practices and process management systems to enhance the delivery of government services in alignment with the mission of e.oman (Sultanate of Oman Digital Oman Strategy and eGovernment). The framework spells out the rules and procedures that ensure that government IT projects and systems are sustainable and in compliance with the Information Technology Authority (ITA) strategies and objectives. It provides assurance about the value of IT projects and framework for the management of IT-related risks. It helps in putting controls to minimize risks and better delivery of IT initiatives3.
7.1.3 Cybersecurity training
Mauritius makes available training for law enforcement and judiciary which has been conducted under the GLACY Project since 2013 and is still ongoing. CERT-MU also carried out cybersecurity trainings on digital forensic investigator professional and network forensic (packet analysis) for law enforcement officers. Training on

information security standards and best practices is given to the technical officers of the IT Security Unit (ITSU) of the Ministry of Technology, Communication and Innovation4.
The New Zealand (NZ) Police is introducing a 3-tiered training program for specialist cyber staff, investigators and then frontline staff. This is outlined in NZ Police's Prevention First National Cybercrime Strategy 2014-2017 5. NZ Police also provides training to the judiciary and prosecutors.
7.2 Technical
Examples for this pillar illustrate practices in areas such as existence of technical institutions, child online protection and industry standards and certification.
7.2.1 National CERT/CIRT/CSIRT
Egypt provides computer emergency response team (EG-CERT) support to several entities in the ICT sector, the financial sector as well as the government sector, in order to help them tackle cybersecurity related threats. EG-CERT is expanding and is currently upgrading its laboratories in the four key operational departments. Additional laboratories are being planned for mobile cybersecurity and industrial control systems cybersecurity6.
Brazil has three computer emergency response teams with different functions, namely: the national CERT, a government CSIRT and a sector specific SCIRT. The Brazil Federal Police participates in the I-24/7 global police communications system developed by Interpol to connect law enforcement officers, including cybercrimes. There is also a complementary Standard No. 17/IN01/DSIC/GSIPR that establishes guidelines for the certification and accreditation for information and communication security professionals of the direct and indirect Federal Public Administration.
7.2.2 Government CERT/CIRT/CSIRT
Luxembourg created a computer emergency response team (GOVCERT.LU) in 2011 to help protect government computer systems and data as well as specific infrastructures and is engaged at both national and international level under the name of NCERT. LU7. GOVCERT.LU is also a critical player in the event of a large cyber-attack affecting country's ICT assets.
7.2.3 Sectoral CERT/CIRT/CSIRT
Sri Lanka created the Financial Sector Computer Security Incident Response Team (FINCSIRT) in 2014 with responsibility for receiving, reviewing, processing and responding to computer security alerts and incidents affecting banks and other licensed financial institutions in the country8. FINCSIRT is a joint initiative of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka computer emergency response team and is steered and funded by the banking sector. Related to FINCSIRT is LankaClear, the country's certification authority owned by the Central Bank and commercial banks9.

7.2.4 Cybersecurity standards implementation framework for organizations Malaysia created the Information Security Certification Body (ISCB), a department of Cybersecurity Malaysia, which manages information security certification10. The certification services are consistent with international standards and guidelines and include among others the Malaysian Common Criteria Evaluation and Certification (MyCC), which certifies security functions of ICT products based on the ISO/IEC 15408 international standard11.
Hungary national regulation lays out the framework for information security training for state and local government officials12. The National University for Public Service (NKE) is charged with training and establishing a certification system13. Certificates issued include information security risk assessment and testing of electronic information systems.
7.2.5 Child online protection Singapore's Internet Content Providers (ICPs) and Internet Access Service Providers (IASPs) are licensable under the Broadcasting Act and they are required to comply with the Internet Code of Practice to protect children online. Since 2012, all service providers have been legally obligated to offer filtering services with Internet subscriptions and to make this known to consumers when they subscribe or renew. The Info-communications Media Development Authority also symbolically blocks 100 pornographic, extremist or hate websites.
7.3 Organizational
Examples for this pillar illustrate practices where governments are organized by having a cybersecurity strategy, a coordinating agency and compilation of indicators for tracking cybercrime.
7.3.1 Strategy United Kingdom issued in 2016 its second five years National Cyber Security Strategy14. The strategy, issued by the Cabinet Office, aims to make the country one of the safest places in the world to carry out online business and doubles investment in cybersecurity compared to the first plan.
Russian Federation officially adopted its National Security Strategy in 2000 and National Security Concept of the Russian Federation as well as Concept of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation in 2013. It established an Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation in 2000 and each government entity in the Russian Federation performs an annual audit of its own networks and systems in line with the doctrine and the areas identified in the various strategies adopted.

7.3.2 Public consultation Canada conducted a three-month public consultation on updating its cybersecurity strategy, asking security professionals and citizens for inputs and views. The consultation was done to help identify gaps and opportunities, bring forward new ideas to shape Canada's renewed approach to cybersecurity and capitalize on the advantages of new technology and the digital economy15.
7.3.3 Responsible agency Iceland created the Cyber Security Council, appointed by the Minister of the Interior that is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. In addition, a cyber security forum has been created as a collaborative venue for representatives of public bodies who sit on the Cyber Security Council and of private entities.
7.3.4 Cybersecurity metrics Netherlands uses metrics annually in order to measure cybersecurity development at a national level, summarized in the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands report16. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) compiles disclosure reports, security advisories and incidents using a registration system. The metrics allow trends to be observed and acted on.
7.4 Capacity building
Examples of practices for capacity building include the aspects of developing the technical and human resources for fighting cybercrime. This includes raising awareness about cybersecurity among the public, the existence of cybersecurity standards and standards bodies, best practices guides, education initiatives and research and development.
7.4.1 Standardization bodies
Romania created the National Standardization Organization17 to produce relevant national standards on processes, tools and technologies for software products and systems in the area of security in information technology. It also tests the standardization integrity of encryption algorithms, authentication services and algorithms for confidential services in compliance with accepted international standards18.
7.4.2 Good practice Canada created the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization (IIROC) that is the national self-regulatory organization overseeing investment dealers and their trading activity in the country's debt and equity markets. IIROC published a cybersecurity best practices guide for its members19.

7.4.3 Cybersecurity research and development programmes
Germany signed an agreement in 2009 on cooperation in IT security research between the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI). The IT Security Research programme covers research and development in new information security technologies. The BMBF has been supporting three research centres since 2011 that bring together leading university and non-university establishments in cybersecurity 20.
Kenya Education Network, (KENET), is the National Research and Education Network (NREN) of Kenya. KENET is the computer emergency response team (CERT) for the academic community and is licensed by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) as a not-for-profit operator serving the education and research institutions. They most notably provide affordable, cost-effective and low-congestion Internet bandwidth services to member institution campuses in Kenya.
7.4.4 Public awareness campaigns
Latvia has published a series of articles on its national CERT portal about free-ofcharge security solutions including anti-viruses, firewalls, NoScript, etc.21 Twice a year, the national CERT organizes a campaign where people can bring their computers for a check-up to see if they are infected, and it also distributes commercial anti-virus installations during the campaigns that are made available free-of-charge for one year.
7.4.5 Cybersecurity professional training courses
Bulgaria established the International Cyber Investigation Training Academy in 2009, which is a non-governmental organization22. The academy aims to improve the qualification of specialists working in the field of cybersecurity. It has trained over 1 300 people from both the public and private sectors.
7.4.6 National education programmes and academic curricula
Germany has several universities and institutes providing degrees and certificates in information security23. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research funds the KASTEL competence centre that offers training leading to a certificate equivalent to a specialized master degree in IT security24. The Technical University of Darmstadt has been offering a Master of Science Degree in IT security since 201025.
7.4.7 Incentive mechanisms
Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) is committed to establishing a network foundation for Internet users and Internet companies by improving competitiveness of Internet services and reliability of Internet information and knowledge.

service to support start-ups to gain ground not only in the domestic market but also the global market to expand their business models.
7.4.8 Home-grown cybersecurity industry Ireland has the largest proportion of the Information and Communication sector of its economy compared to all other countries in Europe and is leveraging that advantage to grow its cybersecurity industry. The country is drawing on existing incentives and attractions with the aim of being a cybersecurity capital26. These incentives include a favourable business environment and low taxes, a talented pool of highly skilled and multilingual workers and a good base for access to European markets27.
7.5 Cooperation
This pillar considers collaborative efforts across national and international domains and between the public and private sector.
7.5.1 Bilateral agreements Finland is an active member of many organizations, such as the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations (UN). Finland has also joined the NATO Partnership for Peace and is engaged in cooperation with the organization in, for example, crisis management. There is also local partnership with Finnish company Codenomicon, which later was acquired by Synopsys, to develop the national IDS system and automatic incident reporting service with FICORA28.
7.5.2 Multilateral agreements Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden collaborate through the Nordic National CERT Collaboration. This includes technical cooperation and cybersecurity exercises to assess and strengthen cyber preparedness, examine incident response processes and enhance information sharing in the region29.
7.5.3 Participation in international fora Participation in international cybersecurity events, workshops and training is the one indicator where virtually all countries score high on the GCI. Therefore, it is more revealing to describe one of the most significant initiatives in this regard. The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)30 was founded in 1990. Its members are security and incident response teams from the public, private and academic sectors. It organizes an annual conference, technical colloquia and training workshops.

7.5.4 Public -private partnerships The United Kingdom is working with local company Netcraft on cyber security initiatives.31 This includes combatting phishing and malware hosted in the United Kingdom as well as phishing targeting the government32. The partnership helped stop 34,550 potential attacks on government departments in the last six months of 2016, or 200 incidents a day. 7.5.5 Interagency partnerships The United States of America started its first cross-government security information sharing agreement in 2015. The Multilateral Information Sharing Agreement (MISA) binds government agencies from defence, health, justice, intelligence community and energy to work collaboratively to enhance cybersecurity information sharing, with an emphasis on information exchanges at machine speed33. South Africa established the national cybersecurity hub to serve as a central point for collaboration between industry, government and civil society on all cybersecurity incidents. The cybersecurity hub is mandated by the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (NCPF) that was passed by Cabinet in 2012. The hub enhances interaction and consultations as well as promoting a coordinated approach regarding engagements with the private sector and civil society34.

8 Conclusion
Cybersecurity is an increasingly important part of our life today, and the degree of interconnectivity of networks implies that anything and everything can be exposed, and everything from national critical infrastructure to our basic human rights can be compromised. Governments are therefore urged to consider policies that support continued growth in technology sophistication, access and security, and as a crucial first step, to adopt a national cybersecurity strategy. The GCI 2017 edition measured the commitment of the ITU Member States to cybersecurity and highlighted a number of illustrative practices from around the world. As a logical continuation of the first iteration of the GCI issued in 2014, this version has motivated countries to improve their work related to cybersecurity, raised awareness in countries for the need to start bilateral, multilateral and international cooperation, and increased the visibility of what countries are doing to improve cybersecurity. However, the research also revealed that while increased Internet access and more mature technological development is correlated with improvement in cybersecurity at the global level, this is not necessarily true for countries with developing economies and lower levels of technological development. The data collection shows that developing countries lack well-trained cybersecurity experts as well as a thorough appreciation and the necessary education on cybersecurity issues for law enforcement, and continued challenges in the judiciary and legislative branches. There is a need for the developed world to help train local experts in cybersecurity, and more cooperation should be initiated between developed and developing countries to assist them in cybersecurity development. For the Global Cybersecurity Index to have an impact on raising awareness on this crucial emerging concern over time, continuity of the GCI effort is essential. ITU therefore welcomes all Member States and industry stakeholders to actively participate in future efforts to enhance the current reference model. As well, the success of future iterations of the GCI largely depends on the engagement of Member States and the quality of their responses to the questionnaire, and ITU calls on all Member States to take part in the next GCI survey. ITU would like to thank all Member States for their valuable support for the conduct of the GCI survey and the publication of this report as well as future ones.
