Protect, control and monitor your data wherever it goes

Dell Data Guardian
If your business is no longer restricted to an office, your data is at increased risk. Critical business data can be anywhere and everywhere. If employees mistakenly­or intentionally­send a file or link to the incorrect person or use a public network that is hacked, data can quickly fall into the wrong hands. The results can be devastating: loss of business, reputation risk and/or fines.
An increasingly mobile workforce enables higher risk. Organizations are enabling more anywhere, anytime workforces to increase worker flexibility and productivity. To be productive, many employees are using a wide variety of devices, from desktop computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets. They are also using external devices and cloud services to share information as part of increasingly collaborative work models.
A new approach to data protection will safeguard data wherever it goes and however it is used. Data needs to be protected from the moment it is created on desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. Data protection must persist when in motion and in use as files are shared with personal email accounts or cloudbased collaboration services. Data should remain protected as it is accessed on a wide range of devices, in a variety of locations and on any type of network. You must ensure data stays secure even as it is shared among a broad array of colleagues, partners and customers. Through all of this data movement, you need ways to monitor who is accessing the data and to revoke access if necessary.

· Protect: secure data wherever it goes. Your data is protected as it is shared via email, cloud services, FTP and portable storage devices by company employees, contractors, vendors and business partners.
· Control: define how data can be accessed. You can define who has access to specific data, when your data can be accessed and how your data can be used.
· Monitor: data access, activity and location. You now have the capability to see who is using your data and how it is being used. You can detect potential problems before they occur and identify potential threats. Take action such as revoking file access where appropriate.
