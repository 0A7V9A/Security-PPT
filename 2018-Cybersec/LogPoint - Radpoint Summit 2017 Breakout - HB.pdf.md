WHAT IS SIEM?

How do we:
Extract information, answers, knowledge and value from the data that already exists within the
organisation

Decentralized logging
­ Problematic areas
Separate logging of different systems
Eg searching in AD requires manual search of X logs
Some logs and systems are not handled today Difficult and timeconsuming to search information
Eg up to X working days for basic reports
No overview of the entire environment Highly dependent on individual employees (Way) too short retention times on some systems
