Abstract

Fearless Security
You have nothing to fear but fear itself

 The information world has changed over the 70 years since computers became a vital component of the modern world, and yet the science of information protection has remained largely stagnant since the 1980s.

 Governments largely chose offense over defense, feeling that the need for intelligence outweighed the need for secure operations. But at the same time, societies and the critical infrastructures supporting them became increasingly dependent on and connected to information systems and networks.

 Today, there is a global and dire need to advance both the science and the practice of information protection. Building a science takes a long time, but a standard of practice for reasonable and prudent protection decision-making exists today

 This talk outlines the process by which a standard of practice can support the development of a science and a science can support the development of a standard of practice, discusses how that process is being undertaken today, and asks for your participation in the effort.

Fearless Security
Fear, Uncertainty, and DoubtYou have nothing to fear but fear itself
 "Computer Security" as a business

­ The goal is to make money

­ If it works too well, you don't need any more of it

­ If it doesn't work well enough, you won't buy it

­ How do we sell it? ­ Fear

FUD

 Bad things will happen to you ­ they have happened to others
­ Uncertainty

 How do you know you're safe? Who's watching the watchers?

­ Doubt

Note: Consistency

 Even the NSA couldn't keep their secrets safeis not the hallmark

 To sell, you need to relieve the fear

of computer security sales

­ If you buy from us, you will be safe ­ trust us, the NSA does

Fearless Security
Fear, Uncertainty, and DoubtYou have nothing to fear but fear itself

 Facts bring clarity ­ ignorance is not bliss

Fearless

­ Governments largely chose offense over defense

 How much is spent on attack weapons vs. defensive shields?  "The best defense is a good offense"  How much is spent on "intelligence" vs."counterintelligence"?  Need for intelligence outweighs the need for secure operations
­ However, as the information age has dawned

 Societies depend on critical infrastructures
­ Water, food, fuel, power, air, financial systems, record-keeping, medical and health systems, police and fire, governance, communications, and ultimately, education, environment, etc.
 These are increasingly dependent on and connected to information systems and networks
­ Critical infrastructures increasingly depend on computers

 Can / will we unwind these dependencies? Likely NO

Fearless Security
The art of information protection You have nothing to fear but fear itself
 Like alchemy ­ information protection is an art, not a science
­ A set of "mystical" notions with rules of thumb
 Change your passwords every XX months  More protective measures makes for more effective protection
­ Many/most of the rules of thumb have little basis
 The password basis stems from WW2 cryptographic systems  The basis for "more is better" doesn't really exist
­ Many/most of the notions are not provided with a real basis
 Probabilistic risk assessment (largely refuted for this area)  Following standards improves protection posture
­ Most of the basis provided is without any science applied
 None of the PRA elements can actually be determined  Most standards can be perfectly followed with little benefit

Fearless Security
Rationalizing decisions You have nothing to fear but fear itself

 Alternatives

­ A finite set of alternatives to choose from (the reality today)

 Example: Duties to protect in what form?

 Decisions

­ Written / Verbal / Email / Web site / Database w/workflows /etc.

­ Conditionals based on finite numbers of facts
 Example: If maturity > "managed"  Database w/workflows
 Basis

­ How and why these conditionals are sensible
 This maturity level requires systematic approaches to process and this (typically today) works via a workflow system
­ Why the particular conditional applies ­ or why not in this case
 But we may have a paper workflow system  no database

Copyright(c) Fred Cohen 2014 ­ All Rights Reserved

Fearless Security
But why is this scientifically valid? You have nothing to fear but fear itself
 It's not ­ but it could be
­ The reason for higher maturity levels is that higher maturity tends to reduce errors and omissions
 e.g., Airplane safety improved by checklists etc. (lots of studies)  e.g., Medical care improved by checklists etc. (a few studies)
­ Higher maturity forces more well-controlled and verified process
 But we haven't done studies on this for information protection
 We need to do scientific studies to bring clarity to this
­ Systematic presence and absence of maturity elements ­ Blind studies of errors and omissions in protection ­ Measurements and analysis to test hypotheses
 Is higher maturity actually better? Always? How high to go?  When is what level of maturity called for?

We apply our Standard of Practice You have nothing to fear but fear itself
 What is a (our) Standard of Practice (SoP)
­ An SoP is not a "Standard" (something you follow) ­ "Reasonable and Prudent" practices (diligent vs. negligent)
 Not the ONLY such practices ­ not always applicable
­ Open source / reviewed: http://all.net/  Protection  SoP ...
 We use the standard of practice to help our experts
­ Ask a reasonably comprehensive set of questions ­ Codify responses consistently in a defined language ­ Guide decisions using pre-defined bases ­ Identify variances from baselines for consideration
 When the standard practice works, we use it
­ When it doesn't, we adapt, and update if/as appropriate

Theory

Fearless Security
You have nothing to fear but fear itself

 Theory is largely non-existent in information protection today

­ Some exceptions:

 Some elements of cryptography  Some elements of information flow control (Shannon, etc.)  Some elements of viruses and malicious software (Cohen, etc.)  Some other things here and there
­ All very limited

 Cryptography largely ignores real-world realities  Information flow controls are rarely used  Viruses and malware theory is largely on what cannot be done  Some other things are very limited
 We need to develop theory for hundreds of subfields

­ The SoP offers a starting point for where to explore

The science of cyber securityYou have nothing to fear but fear itself
 Causality, Testability, Refutation, and Adaptation
­ Cause works via mechanisms to produce effects
 C m E ­ Causality is the foundation of all science
­ A scientific theory must be testable by experiment
 The experiment can show the theory to be wrong  For a universal theory, it cannot prove the theory right  To "test" we need to "measure" something ­ what?
­ When a theory is refuted, we adapt the theory
 Or try another
 The flat earth was a scientific theory
­ An experiment proved it wrong (circumnavigation) ­ Science developed a new theory

Critical threshold
Linear combination of resources consumed

 Examples of critical resources: Critical resource usage

Fearless Security
You have nothing to fear but fear itself

Time to serve

 Testing the theory:

R=(k r +k r +... k r )

11 22

nn

­ Isolate a specific resource, one at a time

Critical threshold
Linear combination of resources consumed

­ Limit resource to a finite known value k =100

Critical resource usage

­ Measure performance with consumption scale

 Consume more and more and measure performance

­ Use up the limited resources

u =(1, 2, ..., 99, 100, 101, ...) 2

 Consume to a threshold and it should hit a knee point

 Should deny services past the knee point
­ Increase available resources

u > k  DoS

Insurance as a further exampleYou have nothing to fear but fear itself
 Ridge Insurance Services Company (RISCO) and Fearless (FS)
­ RISCO offers cyber-insurance as a master broker
 Underwritten by Corporation of Lloyds members and others
­ FS provides SoP reviews for potential insured clients
 Metrics on actual practices vs. SoP with expert judgement (situation)  Better risk understanding for rates / deductibles / limits (theory)
­ Insurance requires reporting on losses / incidents / changes
 Reporting (measurement) correlated to SoP results (theory)
­ FS supports improvements in protection posture by clients
 Changes in practice tracked to feedback (measurements v. theory)  Report on improvements and risk changes to RISCO
­ RISCO offers rate reduction for better protection environments
 Actuarial data produced rate reduction for better protection
­ Together we build the scientific basis through feedback

How does insurance help society? You have nothing to fear but fear itself

 Decision-makers need a good reason to spend money

­ What reasons can you provide internally?

The feedback we have been



Whatever

those

reasons

are,

they

are

limited

looking for  You don't know enough internally to do risk management right!

 Insurance changes this by looking at risk pools

­ Many organizations with characterized protection approaches,
environments, and details of changes Fearless Security
­ Knowledge of incidents and outcomes You have nothing to fear but fear itself

 Final outcomes result in payouts from insurance pools  Incidents are used against deductibles and are reported
 The net effect will be correlation between protection and outcome

­ Decision makers pay known insurance or protection costs

­ Markets drive value of goods / services per outcomes
