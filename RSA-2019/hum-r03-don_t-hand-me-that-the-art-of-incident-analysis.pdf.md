Agenda
My inspiration for this talk The problem: Is your SOC doing effective incident analysis? All about the three `C's What can we do?
­ Right now and longer term

Some inspiration

#RSAC
Why am I here?

#RSAC
So I heard about this book
· It's not about Information Security
· Let's take a closer look...

#RSAC
It is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room--especially when there is no cat.

#RSAC
And then there is this book...
"In complex systems, decisionmaking calls for judgments under uncertainty, ambiguity and time pressure. In those settings, options that appear to work are better than perfect options that never get computed."

Analysis is Like Solving a Mystery... A good example of #RSAC solving a mystery:
"I was trained as a physicist, and in physics we're always trying to figure out how the world works," he explained. "But you have to ask the right questions. You have to investigate things. You always have to be willing to question your assumptions. DDoS defense is very similar. You can't just look at the attacks you're getting. You have to be more proactive and try to attract more attacks and take some risks." ­Damian Menscher

Incident analysis is also a world of uncertainty

#RSAC
How to save the world
Stanislav Petrov literally saved the world, in the face of wildly incomplete information

#RSAC
What's broken here?

#RSAC
Wanna Cry?

Is your SOC doing effective analysis?

#RSAC
Polling Question #1
How would you currently rate your incident handling analysis quality? https://rsa1live.eventbase.com/polls?event=rsa2019&polls=3868

#RSAC
What does this mean?

#RSAC
Or how about this?

#RSAC
What does this mean?
Jul 16 10:54:39 SourceFire SFIMS: [1:469:1] ICMP PING NMAP [Classification: Attempted Information Leak] [Priority: 2] {ICMP} 210.22.215.77 -> 67.126.151.137
"The known is never safe; it is never quite sufficient." -Firestein

#RSAC
Think about a task you are given- how do you analyze it?
You put together a timeline/project plan You work diligently to achieve it Yet the steps you originally map out never end up completed like you originally planned
­ Oftentimes, the end-result isn't what was originally asked for either

The three Cs
Critical Thinking Communication Control of the Message

#RSAC
The Six Step Analysis Technique
1. Build your knowledge of the target 2. Determine the global level of experience 3. Determine any bias or ulterior motives 4. Translate jargon 5. Be sure the test platform analysis has been properly
calibrated 6. Assure that the you get the most direct answer

#RSAC
Where does the Critical Thinking need to happen?

#RSAC
Critical thinking applies to InfoSec analysts, too
"Being a scientist requires having faith in uncertainty, finding pleasure in mystery, and learning to cultivate doubt." -Firestein

#RSAC
Let's talk about Target (yes, again)
"Predicting or targeting some specific advance is less useful than aiming for deeper understanding." ­Firestein
Ouch!

#RSAC
Hypothesis or no? "...you may often miss data that would lead to a better answer, or a better question, because it doesn't fit your idea." ­Firestein

#RSAC
Let's dissect a site for a second...

Communication, communication, communication

#RSAC
Polling question #2
How would you rate your communication process for incidents? https://rsa1live.eventbase.com/polls?event=rsa2019&polls=3869

#RSAC
At what point does Visual Incident Response help?

Sometimes For sure

#RSAC
Controlling the message What's going on Impacts of the event Actions Communication considerations

What can we do?

#RSAC
So what should you focus on?
"The lesson here is to recognize the value of the observable and to leave the unmeasurable stuff for later." -Firestein

#RSAC
OK, so what do you do now?
Start asking questions (as soon as you get back)
­ Always assume (yes, you have permission) that you don't know everything
Take a look at your incident handling SOPs (longer term)

#RSAC
Then maybe apply a little DREAD (longer term)
We need to think a little differently Having a framework for your questions can be helpful So use as you see fit

#RSAC
Another way to go

#RSAC
"In an honest search for knowledge you quite often have to abide by ignorance for an indefinite period."
-Erwin Schrodinger

#RSAC
In summary
Need more analysis Careful automation Practice, practice, practice! There are a lot of resources listed in this presentation (use them!) Ignorance drives science...so why not InfoSec as well?

Thank you! Keep the conversation going
