What We've Learned
Allies are people who:
­ Believe in abundance, that when one group is elevated, all rise. ­ See something, say something, even better do something. ­ Understand that no cultural movement happens when large groups are
disenfranchised and create a way for everyone to participate. ­ Invest time, money, sweat, and tears, even if the payback is not in view
yet. ­ Believe it can be better and that they have the personal responsibility to
take whatever action is in their sphere of authority and ability. ­ Use their talent to ensure that everyone's voice is effective and heard. ­ Find the way to make positive change sustainable.

What We've Learned
The cybersecurity community has rallied in so many ways to creatively address the talent shortage they are impossible to list here. Individuals, non-profits, the public sector, and corporations have stepped up to do two amazing things at the same time:
­ Train and equip a new generation of cyber professionals and fill the pipeline.
­ Create opportunity for women and underrepresented groups to participate in meaningful, and well-compensated employment.
