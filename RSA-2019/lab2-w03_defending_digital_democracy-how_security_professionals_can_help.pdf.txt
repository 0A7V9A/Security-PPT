What is a Tabletop Exercise (TTX)?
A simulation mirroring real world conditions and events that help prepare to overcome future challenges. Everyone has a role and corresponding responsibilities. Compressed timeline provides additional stress; requires participants to absorb information, make decisions, and develop/execute plans on an accelerated timeline. Provides actionable lessons learned and increased awareness.

The Big Picture Behind this Scenario
The scenario, location, and all its actors are fictional. This is a non-partisan event. Every attack in the scenario is something that has either happened, been attempted, or observed in a parallel fields. These threats are absolutely real. Just like in reality, there will be times when you have imperfect information and must make a decision.

#RSAC
Injects
Injects will occur throughout the scenario. Think of them like Chance cards in Monopoly. Something good or bad (but probably bad) is going to happen. Your actions do not count if they are not written down in detail!
­ What are they? ­ When do they occur? ­ Who executes them? How?

Apply What you Have Learned Today!
In the next week you should:
­ Join the Team: Reach out to D3P if you want to help an election office or campaign (we already work with Crowdstrike, Google, Microsoft and many others).
In the next three months you should:
­ Do Your Part: Consider how your organization can help an election office or campaign by providing time, knowledge, or resources (e.g., Google's Project Shield and Cloudflare's Athenian Project provide DDoS mitigation for election offices).
­ Communicate: Local officials can use your support not only to implement security solutions but also to educate and communicate with the public.
­ Advocate: Elections are a state and local run issue--your legislators decide how to regulate election security, so talk with them!
