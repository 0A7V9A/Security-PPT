Agenda
What is the security metrics matrix? The contingent value of security controls without metrics Demonstrating value for money: Useful metrics Moving from the defender's dilemma: A better approach to risk management Creating customized metrics

The importance of metrics
An overview

#RSAC
Frustrated observations from C-level managers
"It's abundantly clear that security companies like to sell their stuff almost as much as my IT department likes to buy it."
"We keep having the same discussion every year. The only difference is that the costs keep getting higher."
"I keep talking ROI. They keep talking about the latest hack in the news. How is that even relevant?"
"Isn't this as simple as just doing more end user training, or even punishing careless actions?"

#RSAC
The problem

Meaningful cybersecurity metrics are hard to create and use

There's a disconnect between these three major elements

Security

Corrections DMV

controls
Message Switch

Management

Metrics / Municipal County State
measurement Federal Law Enforcement

We've seen that security professionals struggle to create and customize meaningful metrics

#RSAC
Lots and lots of questions
How do I justify spending to leadership? Am I spending too little, too much or just right? Are my controls effective? Are my controls worth the cost? How can I improve my operations and controls? How do I demonstrate effectiveness of security controls for third parties/regulatory/contractual requirements? How do I drive the behavior I want in the organization in regards to security?

#RSAC
Terms, terms and more terms
Cloud... IoT... Risk... Breach... Response ... ROI...
7

#RSAC
Common denominators
How do I determine/demonstrate value? How do I maximize value? How do I know and show how well I'm protecting my organization? What do I need to do to protect it better and how much will it cost?
8

Group discussion 1: Talking about your environment and situation
What questions are most important for you? What approaches are working/not working and why?

Setting the stage
A starting point... Detection and Response/SOC operations

#RSAC
Foundations and core beliefs
Value people & skills over technology & prioritize my investments accordingly
Prevention failures are inevitable.
­ The trick is to contain them before they become breaches ­ Define your terms
Measuring the effectiveness of everything and constantly improving it is critical

#RSAC
Essential terms and approaches
Business
­ Value for money vs. Return on investment (ROI)
­ Risk management
Technical
­ Sensors ­ Threat hunting ­ Root cause analysis

#RSAC
Root cause analysis and exploits ­ using consistent terms

Compromise / prevention failure
­ When the system protection files
­ For example, antivirus doesn't catch the exploit

Breach: Threat actors completing
their objective

Detection
­ Secondary control ­ Individual

Containment
­ Not exposure time
­ How long it takes to manage the attack

#RSAC
Defining terms (cont'd)

Dwell time

Very important to create and use consistent terms. Consider the complexities that are involved . . .

Detection elements
­ Collect info ­ Validate ­ Implement ­ Containment
time
­ Metrics

Management may not be technical, but they know risk very, very well

Group discussion: Metrics and organization maturity level
Would the detection and response approaches work at your organization?

Group discussion: Baselining your organization
Where are you, based on the data we've given you?

Creating meaningful, impactful metrics
Questions to ask ­ and answer

#RSAC
Mapping controls to metrics
Security controls galore
But very little measurement of success
The goal?
­ Create consistent, justifiable metrics
­ Ensure funding for personnel
­ Funding for tech, too
This isn't a "checkbox" exercise

#RSAC
Some considerations
X vs Y side of the equation Coverage Baselines Use cases Team member skill

#RSAC
Some considerations (cont'd)
Overlap != Bad
­ Defense in Depth vs. Redundancy ­ Approach

#RSAC
Some considerations (cont'd)

Cost vs. Breach
­ Direct Cost
o Legal o Notification o Professional Services
­ Reputation/Brand
Considerations
­ Cost ­ Savings ­ Recovery

(R-E) + T = ALE R ­ ALE = ROSI
T == Cost of IDS E == Dollar Savings of Using IDS to stop intrusions R == Cost per year to recover

#RSAC
ROI ­ really?
ROI compares the amount of income derived from an investment with the cost of the investment. ROI is known as a profitability ratio, because it provides information about management's performance in using the available resources to generate income.
Those who advocate using ROI in the context of security equate savings with return. The key principle to understand is that
wealth preservation (saving) is not the same as wealth creation (return). -- Bejtlich

#RSAC
Conclusions?
Justify new spend?
­ 7% - 10% of overall IT
Buy/No Buy/Replace/Remove
­ Does it provide a significant NEW/UNIQUE capability?
­ Does it significantly improve an existing capability?
­ What is the effectiveness measurement of the tool?

Group discussion 4
Mapping metrics to security controls: Tracking progress, identifying value for money / ROI

Driving behavior with metrics?
Let's pivot to another outcome: Can we leverage security metrics to drive fundamental behavior changes?

#RSAC
Does security really need to be so hard?
Social engineering ­ we can (re)educate for that Most application security flaws are just good coding practice issues Most system security flaws are just poor IT hygiene issues Many of the challenges in security stem from weak IT fundamentals
­ Patching ­ Consistent Configuration and Maintenance ­ Basic concepts like least privilege
42

#RSAC
What if we can cut through the confusion?
Clarity on what we want business teams to prioritize Use a scoring model readily understood Patching? Findings? Security awareness? SAST, DAST, and Pentests?
43

Group discussion 5
What behavior would you want to drive with metrics?

Practical Application
Current situations and moving forward

#RSAC
Your current situation
1. What metrics do you have in place right now?
2. How do you develop those metrics?
3. Is management aware of these metrics? Do they understand them?
4. Have you shown progress to goal?
5. Discovery questions
a) How do you prove value for money? b) What does the funding discussion look
like with management? c) What teams do you currently have in place?

#RSAC
How to move forward
1. What would that discussion look like?
2. It's not a perfect world:
­ How do you cope with less-than-ideal situations?
­ Who can help you build consensus?
­ What tactics and strategies can help?

#RSAC
Real-world implementation challenges
Data availability Resistance to measurement Measuring activity done by other teams People collected data vs. machine collected data
48

Group discussion 6
Discuss thoughts on how to move forward based on your current challenges

Group discussion 7
Using teams to customize and verify metrics

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned today
Next week you should:
­ Identify stakeholders, as well as technical and business environments
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Identify most-critical resources (e.g., "crown jewels") ­ Determine metrics for using key security controls ­ Have approved metrics
Within six months you should:
­ Review metrics in a meaningful way ­ Adjust metrics according to findings of red team / blue team
