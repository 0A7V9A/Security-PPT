Immediate Action Items
Identify if your organization has privileged corporate network?
What access do users get as a result of this implied trust?
Identify gaps in the provisioning and de-provisioning process in your organizations
Are you tapping into event sources? What about de-provisioning?
If you liked anything which is not open-sourced yet. Please email me @tdharamshi@netflix.com.

How to apply what we learnt today
Adopt standards OpenId, OAuth 2.0, SAML and leverage IDP's like PingFederate, Okta, Auth0 etc. See if apache module, alb authentication fits your organization needs. Adopt multi-factor authentication and adaptive authentication for stronger authentication How does your endpoint security strategy looks like?
Does your organization adopt BYOD? Checkout Stethoscope app
