Inputs from the Sessions
Innovations and leverage in Technology, Operations and Policy Getting Diversity into the Cybersecurity Workforce Four possible future scenarios

TAKING ACTION ­ Can we try some game theory?

#RSAC
Move from reactive Whack-a-Mole to Chess
But threats and IT "advancements" are more like random moles than predictable chess pieces
5

#RSAC
Find the Ladders, Avoid the Chutes
Unfortunately, the ladders and chutes don't stay still...

Machine Learning and Adaptive Something or Other to the Rescue?

#RSAC
Constants
Software will always have vulnerabilities
­ But it can have fewer!
People will always make mistakes and take chances
­ But usually in a human understandable manner
Keeping the business in business will always be Job 1
­ But security can move up from Job 99 to Job...
The infrastructure will never secure the infrastructure
­ But it can be much less of an attractive nuisance
8

More Money and More People!

#RSAC
The Right Resources vs. More Resources
Every cybersecurity survey ever done lists lack of budget, lack of resources
­ Same as every IT or business survey
There is little to no correlation between security spending as a % of revenue or IT budget and security results. Complexity is still the enemy

#RSAC
Effectiveness and Efficiency

Very High (>7% of rev)
Security cost to business
Very Low (<.1% of rev)

Go directly to jail

Good work if you can get it

Flying ? Best of Breed

net

lucky

Security Cost =
Security Expenditures + Incident Costs + Bus. Restraint Costs

Too Low Level of Protection Too High

#RSAC
Leverage = Convincing Others to Support Change
Convince CIO security can enable IT cost reduction/maturity improvement. Convince COO that reducing downtime due to security has positive ROI. Convince CMO that privacy and trust will increase click through rates. Convince HR that training attracts and retains diverse workforce, saves money over trading unicorns with other companies.

#RSAC

#RSAC
When You Get Back To Work
Establish a realistic baseline
­ May require outside look
Start/build relationships with key leverage "partners" Identity strong authentication and encryption insertion points as enablers Establish "Basic Security Hygiene" gains as efficiency improvements Make a measurable promise in effectiveness and/or efficiency gains
­ It is only a journey if you predict where you will be when you get there
