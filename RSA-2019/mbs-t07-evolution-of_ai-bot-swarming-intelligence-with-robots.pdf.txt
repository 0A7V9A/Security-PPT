Will Robots be Top of Mind for Parents?
20 years ago: Physical Security in Schools was not a concern of parents and students
Present Day: Security Officers (humans) are being added to Schools
Future: Robots will work with Officers:
­ Higher Quality of Safety ­ More Rapid Detection of Danger ­ A safer Team-oriented Resolution ­ Lower costs of School Safety ­ Machine-Human "swarming"

Swarms

#RSAC
Swarm-as-a-Service
A new methodology was announced by scientists in Hong Kong that uses natural swarm behaviors to control clusters of nano-robots. These microswarms can be directed to perform precise structural changes with a high degree of reconfigurability, such as extending, shrinking, splitting and merging.

Swarm Intelligence
Unanimous A.I. is using human swarm intelligence to help its AI algorithms predict with better accuracy.

Swarming Robots
Radhika Nagpal is an American computer scientist and researcher in the fields of self-organising computer systems, biologicallyinspired robotics, and biological multi-agent systems. She is a Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University and the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

The Evolution of Robotics
1962-1979: Robots emerged in Manufacturing
1908-Present: Modern Industrial Robots
Robots now assist with Brain Surgery
Robotic Swarming Intelligence is an emerging Technology

#RSAC
Robotic Vision/NLP with Deep Learning Algorithms
TensorFlow and other Open Source Deep Learning algorithms are available for computer vision and NLP Example: WowYow (startup) and video object recognition through lens of a robot camera

Swarming Algorithms

Vector = spatial heading and velocity of robots and drones
Swarms: Collective, Collaborative, Cooperative... execute missions

.y=u1 sin

(speed)

u1
(heading)

.x=u1 cos

Can Vectors represent cognitive behaviors and discovered opinions?

collision avoidance

Ant Colony

Flocking

Optimizations algorithms

Heading and Velocity x

Could Blockchain be used for decentralized sharing and voting in swarms?

Today's robot Swarming Algorithms are focused on physical spatial aspects of swarming Drones
and Robots

#RSAC
Swarming Algorithm Examples
2018 Winter Olympics, record-setting 1,218 drones
Intel's Shooting Star drones are a footlong, weigh eight ounces, and can fly in formation up to 20 minutes
"A Sea of Robots": Institute of Telecommunications at University Institute of Lisbon and from University of Lisbon in Portugal
Learned "Behaviors" to Communicate, Collaborate and reach Consensus

Back to Cyber Security and AI-Bots
Cyber-Criminals build systems that can `learn' and adapt to defenses: Nachi Worm, Mirai, Reaper Botnets... EternalBlue exploit has now merged with the Mirai botnet!
Bots are becoming one of the fastest growing trends with intelligent reasoning, messaging and conversational interfaces (e.g. Chatbots)
AI-Bot Capabilities:
­ Machine Learning and Cyber Intelligence ­ Behavioral Analysis and Ontology ­ Understands Entity State (Posture) ­ Orchestration and Deception Tactics
AI-Bots can live inside a Robot, Drone, be virtual in a Cloud, be resident on an Edge (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA TXT2), be the brains of a new-age SIEM (AI Cognitive Security Tool)

#RSAC
AI-Bots and Cognitive Machine Learning Value-add?
Security Operations Centers (SOC) require a new paradigm to be effective, especially when the attackers may now be using AI/MachineLearning technology (Attack Bots) in their attack vectors:
Automation where it hurts the most
Visualization Tools which "Connect the Dots" on a potential breach
Combine the strengths of Humans and Machines
Create unified Workflow and a seamless investigation Workspace
Use machines to Model how attackers operate and Automate the way analysts Investigate

#RSAC
Cognitive AI-Bots have Contextual Cyber Insight
Many new Security Tools are focused on time-series data flows (Why?)
Metadata-rich Security Events should:
­ Answer a "Question" ­ Reveal an "Intent" ­ Represent a "Behavior" that can be
classified
A Semantic Chain of Events can represent the "Incident" (related events) AI-Bots collaborate with humans to "team" and create the "Storyline" of behavioral changes and "Entity" changes in state (posture)

#RSAC
Physical and Cyber Security Convergence
IT is an Event, Alert, Ticket oriented workforce
Cognitive Engines will automate event workflow analysis between humans/machines/robots
­ Exposure: Virtual and Physical ­ Risk Profiles: Probability and Analytics ­ Threat Actors and Threat Methods ­ Human Understanding: "Controls", Business Model

What

Resources Vendors Business Technology

does the organization rely on that can be exploited by others?

#RSAC
Summary: Cyber and Robotic Security Swarming
Cognitive AI-Bots are here today:
can live inside a cloud, a robot, drone, a Raspberry Pi, TXT2 Edge... can chat with humans using Slack, Alexa, Mobile Apps... will have Cognitive Engines (brains) to understand an event stream of the Past, Present and AI/ML Predictive Future have vision through cameras for Objects of High Risk Interest (AI) can listen through microphones for gun shots or screams Can Swarm with other AI-Bots to Collaborate, Communicate and reach Consensus

Applying the Cyber and Physical Dimensions of Security
Think about your Data Ingest points for "Cyber Intelligence" that are both Virtual (e.g. logs) and Physical (e.g. IoT cameras) Identify Use Cases where having physical intelligence would make your security framework "smarter" and more effective
­ For example, a Botnet attack on your IoT devices that cause them to change virtual and physical behaviors
Get with your Facilities team to partner on making IoT devices not only protected, but part of the Security Framework.
­ For example, if a certain object of interest is seen, generate alert and also orchestrate an automated action to be taken
Identify and track future Robot capabilities that can help integrate (swarm) with your security AI tools and staff for a safer, smarter security posture
­ Example: Promote and Support robots that can help secure your child's schools

Example Use Cases in our Security Domain:

Tying AI/ML to Biometrics

Outdoor Surveillance

Home Security Police Action Work Safety School Safety
