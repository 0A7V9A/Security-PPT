I Am The Cavalry

The Cavalry isn't coming... It falls to us

Problem Statement
Our society is adopting connected technology faster than we are able to secure it.

Mission Statement
To ensure connected technologies with the potential to impact public safety and human life are worthy of our trust.

Why Trust, public safety, human life

How Education, outreach, research

Who Infosec research community

Medical

Automotive

Connected Home

Public Infrastructure

Who Passionate volunteers

What Long-term vision for cyber safety

Collecting existing research, researchers, and resources
Connecting researchers with industry, media, policy, and legal
Collaborating across a broad range of backgrounds, interests, and skillsets
Catalyzing positive action sooner than it would have happened on its own

#RSAC
The single biggest risk to the health of future generations is trust and trustworthiness of care delivery.

A Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices
I will revere and protect human life, and act always for the benefit of my patients. I recognize that all systems fail; inherent defects and adverse conditions are inevitable. Capabilities meant to improve or save life, may also harm or end life. Where failure impacts patient safety, care delivery must be resilient against both indiscriminate accidents and intentional adversaries. Each of the roles in a diverse care delivery ecosystem shares a common responsibility: As one who seeks to preserve and improve life, I must first do no harm.
To that end, I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability, these principles.
· Cyber Safety by Design: I respect domain expertise from those that came before. I will inform design with security lifecycle, adversarial resilience, and secure supply chain practices.
· Third-Party Collaboration: I acknowledge that vulnerabilities will persist, despite best efforts. I will invite disclosure of potential safety or security issues, reported in good faith.
· Evidence Capture: I foresee unexpected outcomes. I will facilitate evidence capture, preservation, and analysis to learn from safety investigations.
· Resilience and Containment: I recognize failures in components and in the environment are inevitable. I will safeguard critical elements of care delivery in adverse conditions, and maintain a safe state with clear indicators when failure is unavoidable.
· Cyber Safety Updates: I understand that cyber safety will always change. I will support prompt, agile, and secure updates.

WARNING

LIVE HACKING
MEDICAL DEVICE SECURITY RESEARCH IN PROGRESS

MOST MEDICAL DEVICES ARE DESIGNED AND TESTED TO REDUCE RISK FROM FORESEEABLE HAZARDS. NO
SECURITY WORKS PERFECTLY AGAINST ALL ACCIDENTS AND ADVERSARIES. PATIENTS WITH CONNECTED MEDICAL
DEVICES ENTER AT THEIR OWN RISK.
