WE NEED GOVERNANCE OVER CYBERSECURITY
"Information Security governance is a subset of enterprise governance that provides strategic direction, ensures objectives are achieved, manages risk appropriately, uses organizational resources responsibility, and monitors the success or failure of the enterprise security programme."
- IT Governance Institute

#RSAC
WIKIPEDIA EXPANDS THE DEFINITION...
Governance relates to decisions that define expectations, grant power, or verify performance. It consists either of a separate process or of a specific part of management or leadership processes. Sometimes people set up a government to administer these processes and systems.
In the case of a business or of a non-profit organization, governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility. For example, managing at a corporate level might involve evolving policies on privacy, on internal investment, and on the use of data.

#RSAC

National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD)

Principle 2 Directors should understand the legal implications of cyber risks as they relate to their company's specific circumstances.

Principle 3

Boards should have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise, and discussions about cyber-risk management should be given regular and adequate time on the board meeting agenda.

Principle 4 Directors should set the expectation that management will establish an enterprisewide cyber-risk management framework.

Principle 5

Board-management discussion of cyber risks should include identification of which risks to avoid, which to accept, and which to mitigate or transfer through insurance, as well as specific plans associated with each approach.

You are the CISO of a major healthcare institution, here is the situation:
1. It is 1 Month before the 04/30/19 annual board update 2. 12 months ago, a IOT Healthcare provider suffered a breach
from web app vulnerability (150M Records, impact still unknown) 3. Your company's merger efforts are in trouble, costing millions more than anticipated, stock price down 15% last quarter, still up 20% for year 4. Re-imaging of machines due to ransomware is running 20% a month 5. Big 4 assessment indicated 2.6 program maturity on 5pt scale 6. Oh... you are presenting: What are you going to say?
