Blockchain Definitions & Use Cases Vary Greatly and Are Rapidly Evolving
Blockchain - A distributed data base or digital ledger that records transactions of value using a cryptographic signature that is inherently resistant to modification
"Blockchain "Smart Contract" represent a digital protocol that automatically executes predefined processes of a transaction without requiring the involvement of a third party

Blockchain Use Cases and Goals

Various project partners, board members and advisors from industry, academia and government

Examine when, where and how to apply blockchain to solve complex cyber security challenges for critical energy infrastructure
Develop blockchain smart contract for energy producers and consumers to transact more autonomously and securely and to regulate both supply and payment
Increase the speed, scale and security of complex peer-to-peer transactions to accelerate decarbonization and decentralization
More autonomous detection of data anomalies to maintain integrity of critical systems
Secure ledger for an array of vulnerable things
Improving asset management management and supply chain security

Blockchain Changes How We Trust
Blockchain Provides Data Provenance and Attribution
Blockchain is constantly in a self-reinforcing Nash Equilibrium state to keep the network Byzantine Fault Tolerant and maintain a stable state Changing How We Trust Will Disrupt Many Sectors

Blockchain Transactions ­ Cryptographic Proof Replaces Third-Party Intermediary
Blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions conducted without the assistance of a third party intermediary.
The public key can be used to view the transaction history of a user but it cannot be used to make a transaction unless the private key is also known.

Blockchain Shows Potential to Increase Trustworthiness of an Array of Vulnerable Things
Cyber And Physical Systems, IT and OT, are Converging In Critical Infrastructures Expanding the Attack Surface

#RSAC
Current Cybersecurity Defenses are Not Keeping Up With Threat

Blockchain can provide a secure ledger for an Array of
Vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT)

20.8 billion connected IoT devices by 2020 (Gartner Inc.)
Spectre and Meltdown - Nearly every computer chip manufactured in the last 20 years contains fundamental security flaw
By 2019 there will be 2 million cyber security positions that go unfilled.
Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021.
Cybersecurity spending to exceed $1 trillion from 2017 to 2021.
Human attack surface to reach 6 billion people by 2022.
Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $5 billion in 2017 -- a 15X increase in two years and expected to worsen

What have we learned from real world use cases?

Use Cases & Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned & Recommendations
· Know Your Critical Cyber Assets
· Monitor Your Critical Cyber Assets
· Test & Understand Risk Associated with Critical Cyber Assets
· Legacy facility related control systems are not "Smart," safe or efficient
· A lot "Smart" industrial controls systems are NOT Cyber smart

#RSAC

Use Cases & Lessons Learned

· Global supply chains are becoming increasingly challenging to secure

· Cyber-physical foot print growing.

· A number of precedents where cyber/digital

attack caused physical damage

"The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines

and valves was programmed to go haywire, to reset pump

speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond

those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result

was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire

ever seen from space."

Use Cases & Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned & Recommendations
· Know and Monitor Your Critical Cyber Assets
· Do Not Run A Flat Network - Segregate & Secure Critical IT & OT Networks
· Cyber Policies Should Help Protect Us From Ourselves
· Hackers Often Use Very Basic Tactics to Hack Very Vulnerable Systems
· Implement Password Management Controls, Firewalls, Encryption & Configuration Policies

Use Cases & Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned & Recommendations

Wanna Cry

· Cyber threats are evolving faster than control system defenses

· Cyber security starts with smart supply chain security, smart procurement and provisioning of devices

· Though it is easy to find vulnerabilities, you can make it tough to exploit them

Non-Petya

· Patch early, Patch often, Patch Smart
· Security is a continuous process that requires active management of cyber risk

Use Cases & Lessons Learned
Lessons Learned & Recommendations
· Get the basics right: Critical facilities lack basic cybersecurity risk management
· Inventory: If don't know your critical cyber assets you can't protect them
· Trust the process: Cybersecurity is a continuous process, not an end state.
· Culture: A holistic response is required to mitigate a complex, evolving and non-linear threat.

"Apply" Lessons Learned: When Should your Organization Consider Using Blockchain Technology?

Fundamentally, different blockchain (BC) technologies offer different "read and write" features. Although readability and writability features come with blockchains, they are also available with typical database technologies. The need to share, the writer's identity, and trust are the key elements in this area to determine the need of a blockchain.
