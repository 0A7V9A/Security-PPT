#RSAC
Do you have to have a third party risk management program?
2

#RSAC
So, what's driving 3rd party risk management programs?
Contractual flow through
­ HIPAA security & privacy ­ GDPR & other privacy regulations
(Australia, China, Russia, Brazil, California, & growing)
Operational risk
Liability management
Regulatory requirements
­ Financial services (OCC, FFIEC, more?)
3

#RSAC
Third party programs can feel out of control
Different requirements from different customers Competing approaches ­
­ SSAE18 ­ Shared assessments ­ Vendor-specific solutions
Multiple security frameworks Lack of uniformity, even within industries Made-up questionnaires
4

#RSAC
Your 3rd party risk program is really two programs

Your infosec program
Demonstrating how you manage risk as a 3rd party to other companies

Your 3rd party program
Managing risk from your 3rd parties

Most companies are both suppliers and consumers of third party solutions

#RSAC
Demonstrate your infosec program

Build a `sharable' document demonstrating your program's compliance with and alignment to a framework
Share the document instead of answering questionnaires
Get external proof (especially if required) and re-use that proof as much as possible ­ SSAE 18 ­ Shared assessments ­ CyberGRX
Identify any specific contract requirements from customers ­ Ensure mechanisms to comply - for example
breach notification requirements

Four score and 7 weeks
ago,our CISO brought forth a
new Information Security Program,
conceived in ISO 27001, and dedicated
to meeting NIST CSF maturity. Now we are
questioned whether this program, or any program so
conceived and so dedicated can pass muster for a third party
risk management program. We are met during an audit of that program. We have come to dedicate a large portion of our time to
answering questions about the program, that our program, and our relationship
with you, our customer, might long endure. Our brave team have struggled mightily to ensure
the security of our systems. The world may little note, nor long remember the answers to these questions, we can only hope that our efforts are sufficient to protect us from adversaries.

8

#RSAC
Contract flow through and your infosec program
Virtually every new contract includes security requirements With provisions for verification by:
­ Questionnaires, ­ Interviews, ­ And potentially audits
Note specific provisions ­ for contract compliance, and to protect your organization Often copied and pasted without regard to your specific products or services
9

#RSAC
Identifying contract requirements

Capturing requirements

Ensuring compliance

Contract requirements come in many forms
­ Addendums & references ­ Jurisdictional regulations
(california, china, russia, EU, etc)
Use spreadsheets and GRC tools to capture these specific requirements
Track changes in requirements

Establish mechanisms to ensure compliance Automate compliance where possible Use reporting and metrics to support compliance Breach notification is quickly becoming a key area Other concerns will be strengthened over time

Remember, compliant is not secure ­ but compliance is contractually required

10

#RSAC
Engage your customers

Work with your business teams to identify your most important customers Meet with the CISO/security team and understand how your security impacts your customer's security and risk Understand how your customers view your security Determine where real program changes are warranted Explore conducting joint incident response exercises Participate in customer advisory board activities with the business

Get to know your customers before an incident forces you to become friends

11

#RSAC
Last thoughts on your information security program
Backstop your program with appropriate insurance: business, cyber, operations, selfRepresenting your program can be costly ­ negotiate with your business partners about resources Customers shouldn't expect to have new security requirements met for free Finally, external risk scorecards can be misleading, investigate and challenge them appropriately
­ These scorecards should be treated like tools, not tablets from the mountaintop
12

3rd Party Program

#RSAC
Forge your 3rd party program carefully
Optimize what drives your business success
Calibrate for Your company
Minimally do what you have to
14

Start with why - why do you have a program?

To pass customer requirements and expectations on to your vendors?

To manage risk from your

vendor's?

To comply with external

requirements?

To manage operational risk?

#RSAC WHY

Your requirements for 3rd parties

#RSAC Requirements

What requirements are you placing on your vendors? Are they realistic and balanced? Can they be verified? How much will you spend on verification? What proof is enough?

Can you leverage what others are doing?

#RSAC Comply

Financial services
Regulators expect banks to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring for all 3rd-party relationships.
Due diligence should be specific to, each third-party relationship.
­ Consistent with the level of risk and complexity posed by each third-party relationship.
­ For critical activities, monitoring will be robust, comprehensive, and appropriately documented.
For low risk activities, this should follow the bank's established policies and procedures for due diligence and ongoing monitoring.

HIPAA & Health
Any third party that contacts PHI through the work it performs is a business associate, or BA.
Both parties must have a contract detailing commitments to compliance
­ Providing assurances relating to the safeguarding of phi or the electronic equivalent, ephi
­ Before granting any level of access to PHI/ ephi

Privacy & GDPR
GDPR deepens or adds requirements :
­ Article 28, requires contractual protections with data processors and their sub-processors.
­ Article 30, "requires data processors to maintain an inventory of the eu personal data they host;
­ Article 32, requires data processors (and subs) to implement information security controls to protect data;
­ Article 33, requires speedy breach notification
­ Article 36, requires data processors to provide impact assessments (dpias) to their clients.
Bottom line: contractually establish SLAs

Tied to critical business operations and the "crown jewels" of that business or businesses
Unique to each organization; may need to be refreshed and updated as your organization changes

Follow the money, especially revenue
Develop enterprise risk management processes, frameworks, metrics and reporting
Evaluate all third parties and triage based on multiple factors.

Side Note: Companies should be especially deliberate in choosing security vendors; Balance streamlining operations and cost efficiency with managing the associated risks of outsourcing.

21

Managing liability

#RSAC Liability

Establish standard language in contracts, with specific, relevant requirements (ie not 27001 compliance for every contract & purchase)
­ Identify specific requirements, especially critical service levels (for example breach notification)
­ Use a consistent framework where you have control
Contractual indemnity clauses can only cover some risk transfer Track compliance by 3rd parties ­ if you require an SSAE-18, did you get one? Could be low level, checklist, well maintained, by anyone Collect 3rd party proof only when needed, but reuse/accept 3rd party proof
­ Use a standard checklist ­ don't build your own
22

Minimize most requests to suppliers

Require minimum compliance in contracts
Presume vendors are compliant with the contract ­ rely on contract law
Track compliance for a formal program, limit verification
Leverage the fact that other companies are verifying and auditing vendor compliance.
Verify only the most critical suppliers (who are unlikely to be verified by someone else)

Benchmarked Practices
Some best practices worth highlighting

#RSAC HOW

A documented end-to-end 3rd party risk management process with identified stakeholders and sub-processes that covers "all" aspects of supplier risk including financial due-diligence, legal assessments, personnel screening, contract compliance verification, and risk scoring. The process includes business owners, technology associates, security experts, risk management personnel, and legal, contracts, and other departments as appropriate. Technology automates the 3rd party risk management process and manages the prioritization of vendors and compliance checks; specifically, databases and automation to ensure regular reviews are conducted, metadata to capture business and technology points of contact, etc. Trained and certified (preferably dedicated) resources are hired and retained to manage 3rd party security. CISSP or similarly certified security experts combined with internal training on company risk processes, source selection, and contracting facilitates highly effective 3rd party risk management. Critical 3rd party solutions are reviewed from an attacker perspective with both automated and manual testing to limit vulnerabilities, proactively prevent foreseeable threats, and eliminate known challenges (like cross-site scripting) prior to deployment.

#RSAC WHAT

Prioritizing 3rd party risk and security management against competing security program portfolio activities and priorities
Automation tools for 3rd party security (and risk) management are not comprehensive; for example, just tracking points-of-contact and related metadata due to personnel changes can be a full-time job.
Many contract and regulatory requirements focus on vulnerabilities and compliance making it hard to prioritize vendors based on risk or threat modeling.
Hiring, developing, and retaining employees with the proper expertise and skill-set is challenging; specifically training and certifying individuals to conduct vendor security assessments and adopting a risk management culture.
Enforcing sub-vendors' information security practices around data storage, processing, and transmission requires a real focus on understanding actual operating practices.

Push your industry ISAC to drive common approaches:
­ Similar 3rd parties, similar needs
­ Reduce system noise and turbulence
­ Highlight opportunities to work together
­ Drive the right behaviors

30

#RSAC
Apply these lessons at home
Review both aspects of your program (up and down) Look beyond the "traditional" for your 3rd party risk program Remember the things you can and can't change at 3rd parties Right-size your activities for your business operations and your specific 3rd parties Review your resource and planning needs Adjust your strategy Focus your program execution on the things you can control
