#RSAC
So what can the firms stuck among the information security 99% do? Wait to be gobbled up or destroyed?

#RSAC
Use all the strategies at your disposal
Standardize Automate Source externally: rent the expertise you can't afford to hire Look for talent that the 1% misses Invest in training people with raw talent and desire to learn

#RSAC
Those are just bandages. How do we fix the problem?

#RSAC
Starting next week, you should:
1. Learn from your firm's public/government affairs office
> Influencing policy is hard... > ...And it takes time and dedication > Like information security, policy has its own language and
conventions that they can teach you

#RSAC
In the next three months you should:
2. Support influential policy organizations and non-profits that reflect your priorities
3. Join relevant industry consortia that need more security or privacy representation
4. Volunteer your expertise to regulators and government officials

#RSAC
And in the longer term:
5. Use professional associations to amplify your voice 6. Use industry consortia to agree policy priorities with your
partners and even competitors and push for them. 7. Want to do even more? Make policy your day job.

#RSAC
Still not sure how to get started? A few easy steps:
Subscribe to a cyber policy newsletters to stay informed (Politico, Axios, etc) Know your target legislative or administrative bodies Check the superiority and cynicism at the door
