Session Outline
What are the attributes of enterprise-grade encryption? How many enterprises are actually using the right encryption? Enterprise encryption case study Enterprise encryption fundamentals Demonstration The intersection of encryption, security and compliance

#RSAC
Enterprise-grade Encryption Attributes
Cryptographic sovereignty ­ not subject to the whims of another party
­ Autonomous root authority ­ Total control over issuance ­ Policy enforcement upon use ­ Full revocability
Problematic situations
­ SSL ­ too many Meddlers in the Middle ­ SaaS ­ whose root is this exactly? ­ Consumer-grade `secure' messaging apps ­ enterprise loses all control

#RSAC
State of the Market: Enterprise Encryption Madness
Working on research with Digital Shadows on extent of SSL manipulation
­ How easy is it to purchase a *.* root from the underground and manipulate enterprise communications to/from SaaS platforms like SalesForce, Office365, etc.
o Should have idea on results by next revision deadline
iOS example of lack of control over SSL trusts
­ Updated graphic on iOS 12 roots of trust and how untrustworthy they are

Enterprise Encryption Case Study - Background
International professional & technical services firm 30,000 global employees, heavy use of WhatsApp because IT leadership believed it was `secure' Regulator from Country X asks for company employee communications relating to a government services contract Company turns over all email e-discovery information

#RSAC
Enterprise Encryption Case Study ­ The Twist

Regulator is given WhatsApp messages by a whistleblower which contradict emails and show significant under-reporting by company Company fined millions due to inability to produce complete WhatsApp message history Bottom line: WhatsApp's encryption is better than SMS or email, but its use within the enterprise represents a significant data protection and compliance risk

#RSAC
How to assure proper use of encryption in the enterprise
Assure appropriate cryptographic infrastructure which facilitates crypto sovereignty Look for tools which allow administrators to easily manage all aspects of the encryption lifecycle
­ Issuance ­ Use restrictions ­ Revocation
Implement encryption tools which reduce the risk of data disclosure and regulatory risks
