What is Being Done to Protect U.S. Election Systems?

U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) Lessons from 2018 Midterms...

· Trend towards resilience (paper records, audits) with non-stop activity to harden elections against dynamic threats

Prevention

· Resources needed to address chronic underfunding of elections/technical support
· Highly decentralized threat environment requires coordinated info-sharing

Monitoring

Response & Recovery

· Few reported threats to EI/ adversaries still attempting to sow discord, spread "fake news" online

Under a 2017 DHS Critical Infrastructure Designation, the federal government has created Government & Private Sector Coordinating Councils to secure U.S. election infrastructure

Exploitable Weaknesses, Vulnerabilities & Exposures

· Weakness: mistake or flaw condition in ICT
architecture, design, code, or process that, if left unaddressed, could under the proper conditions contribute to a cyber-enabled capability being vulnerable to exploitation; represents potential source vectors for zero-day exploits -- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) https://cwe.mitre.org/
· Vulnerability: mistake in software that can be
directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system
or network; Exposure: configuration issue of a
mistake in logic that allows unauthorized access or exploitation ­ Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) https://cve.mitre.org/
· Exploit: take advantage of a weakness (or multiple
weaknesses) to achieve a negative technical impact -attack approaches from the set of known exploits are used in the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) https://capec.mitre.org

2005
WEAKNESSES

2012 1999
2002 2005

VULNERABILITIES

CVEs
(reported, publicly known
vulnerabilities and
exposures)

Unreported or undiscovered Vulnerabilities
Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (previously unmitigated weaknesses that are exploited with little or no warning)

Uncharacterized Weaknesses
CWEs
(characterized, discoverable, possibly exploitable weaknesses with mitigations)

The existence (even if only theoretical) of an exploit designed to take advantage of a weakness (or multiple weaknesses) and achieve a negative technical impact is what makes a weakness a vulnerability.
