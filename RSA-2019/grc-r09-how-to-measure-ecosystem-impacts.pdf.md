Intro to DMARC
DMARC
­ Email security standard ­ "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &
Conformance" ­ Implemented via DNS records
Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) has a project to drive deployment Asked Adam, Jay and Wade for help measuring that project's ROI

#RSAC
The Concept of Measurement
"Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is based on the idea of approximation. If a person tells you they know a thing exactly, then you can be safe in inferring that you are speaking to an inexact person."
Bertrand Russell Philosopher, Mathematician, No1b1el Laureate

#RSAC
The Concept of Measurement
Measurement: A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity
"Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science is based on the idea of approximation. If a person tells you they know a thing exactly, then you can be safe in inferring that you are speaking to an inexact person."
Bertrand Russell Philosopher, Mathematician, No1b2el Laureate

The Object of Measurement
"There is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the ambiguity of words."
Thomas Reid Scottish Philosopher

Key Decision: Focus on Business Email

#RSAC

Compromise (BEC)

There is a morass between phishing email and breach

Path between email and financial loss is relatively clear

From the [incomplete] data, BEC losses dwarfed all other email losses

This concept of measurement made other decisions fall into place.

"On average a targeted organization has 5.2 BEC emails sent to them each month." - Symantec
­ Note: At 5.2 per month, the annual average is about 62 BEC emails.
"On average, companies were targeted by 18.5 fraudulent emails per quarter." Proofpoint
­ Note: at 18.5 per quarter, the annual average is about 74.
"In the second half of 2017, BEC attacks continued to accelerate with 96% of organizations analyzed by Agari being attacked at least one time, and with the average business experiencing 45 BEC attacks from June through December 2017." - Agari "In the first three months of this year (2017), nearly 85% of organizations were targeted by at least one BEC message." - Proofpoint

Proportion of BEC using Domain Spoofing
GreatHorn reports out of 537,617 spear-phishing threats, 44,726 were "direct spoofs", which is about 8% of the fraudulent emails they studied. Agari covers this statistic quite thoroughly:
"...Agari's research shows that 12% of BEC attacks use spoofing; 7% a combination of look alike domains  and display name deception; and 81% pure display name deception." "For organizations that use Proofpoint, 95% of attacks that went undetected used display name deception and 5% domain spoofing." "For organizations that used Microsoft EOP with no third party SEG, 90% of attacks were display name deception, 7% domain spoofs and 3% look alike domain based BEC" "For organizations that use Google G Suite with no third party SEG, 93% of the attacks that were not blocked used display name deception and 7% domain spoofing." "For small businesses, 90% of BEC attacks observed used display name deception, 6% used domain spoofing and 4% used look alike domains. "For medium businesses, 95% of BEC attacks used display name deception, 3% used domain spoofing and 2% used look alike Domains. "For large businesses, 75% of BEC attacks used display name deception, 16% domain spoofing and 9% look alike domains."

#RSAC
How Many Clicks Does a BEC Get?
Phishing success rates are "well studied"
­ Commercial training companies compete on click through rates ­ 5% to 100% success rates reported
BEC  phishing
­ Response to a message is not the same as funds transferred ­ We found no reported BEC success rate
Large opportunity to reduce uncertainty here
34

#RSAC
"Everything is Obvious...with hindsight"
We wrote decent justifications that span the possibility space "BEC uses social norms and gets less attention than phishing, so the rate of success could be higher"
­ Victims are giving it 110%?
"BEC requires more steps, so there's more to go wrong?"
­ Could reasonably be 1-5%
This is a key uncertainty -- we use a very conservative estimate

Financial Loss
Statistics: "In 2017, the IC3 received 15,690 BEC/EAC complaints with adjusted losses of over $675 million." (FBI/IC3). - Note average is $43k $131K in average loss for U.S. victims, and a $71K worldwide average loss. (FBI) over $12 billion in losses over 78,617 domestic and international incidents, which averages out to about $160,000 per organization (FBI 2018)
Headlines: "Leoni AG... became a victim of a BEC attack when its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) was tricked into transferring about US $44.6 million" (TrendMicro) "Xoom was probably the year's first victim of a Business Email Compromise (BEC) to the tune of $31 million." (Verizon) "...Belgian bank Crelan announced they were the victim of a 78 million BEC fraud." (about $91 million USD). (Verizon)

In the next month:
­ Set up a DMARC p of "none" if you don't have at least that. (None generates reports, doesn't change mail delivery.)
­ Within six months you should: ­ Have a stronger DMARC policy ­ If you release reports, make sure they pass the criteria we've shared
