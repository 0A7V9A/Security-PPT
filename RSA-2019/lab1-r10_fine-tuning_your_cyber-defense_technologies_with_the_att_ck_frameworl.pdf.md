ATT&CK
MITRE has developed a curated knowledge base and framework known as Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK). ATT&CK provides knowledge describing behaviors, actions, and processes that a cyber adversary might utilize once initial access has been gained within an organization's network.

Exercise 4 ­ Group Discussion
Why would we want to use deception nowadays?
­ Consider this with respect to the goals of ATT&CK.
39

#RSAC
Exercise 5 ­ ATT&CK and Deception
Using the ATT&CK Matrix in your handout and what we've discussed for deception, let's map techniques that are suitable targets for deception technologies.

Final Thoughts
Did you observe any patterns or trends here in our discussions today? What do things like the ATT&CK Framework, Threat Hunting, System Complexity, etc. imply to you?
42

#RSAC
Final Thoughts
Answer:
­ Embracing System Compromise
43

Final Thoughts
Traditional Thinking
­ Defend list of assets ­ Manage incidents ­ View pentest results as report card ­ Think about stopping attacks

#RSAC
Newer Thinking
­ Defend graph of assets ­ Manage adversaries ­ View pentest results as input ­ Think about increasing attacker
requirements

44

#RSAC
Summary ­ What did we accomplish today?
Learned about the MITRE ATT&CK Framework Learned how to Fine Tune Cybersecurity Technology with ATT&CK Learned how Deception and ATT&CK Can Work Together
45

#RSAC
Applying What You Have Learned
Next week you should:
­ Introduce your security staff and stakeholders to ATT&CK as a learning resource
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Perform a gap analysis using ATT&CK with respect to your people, processes, and technologies
Within six months you should:
­ Formulate and execute a roadmap for filling in any relevant gaps
