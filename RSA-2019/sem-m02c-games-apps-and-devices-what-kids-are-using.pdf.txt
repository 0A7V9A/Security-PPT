l Maybe? ­ Can you tell while you're being tricked?
l Do we care? ­ Do you? ­ Money, happiness, fun-- all worth it.

Final Observations
l Free is good but getting paid is better. l The older we get the more we care about interruptive ads. l The app doesn't have to be useful. l The game doesn't have to be fun. l We will keep an app even if we just have 1 connection.
