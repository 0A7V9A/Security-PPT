FTC Sues maker of consumer products for failing to build #RSAC in basic cyber security measures
http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/05/technology/ftc-d-linklawsuit/index.html?iid=EL
Part of the highly publicized Dyn Attack
D-Link is facing litigation costs and penalties, as well as court order mandates for compliance for omitting basic cyber security measures
FTC is bringing this forward.
D-Link products are extremely popular world-wide
Suit filed January 2017. Court dismissed 3 of 6 FTC complaints citing lack of demonstration of disclosure of PII or harm....lawsuit still ongoing.
Why is this happening?

Is the Internet of Things Really Different?
Key Concerns:
· Privacy ­ generating a lot of data · Security ­ Connecting everything
"Systems of Systems"

The Government Role is Slow to Evolve

January, 2017 - Challenges from Report:
1. Reserving certain frequencies for communication for emergency responders
2. IPv4, IPv6 problem-running out of addressable space on internet-need to solve for these two problem.
Conclusion: It will take gov't a while to catch up with technology

How to Get Started with IoT
Start by researching your industry, and emerging regulatory trends coming from Government agencies
­ Example, if your in the automotive industry, what is the Department of Transportation thinking about?
Next pick one of the emerging frameworks focused on IoT and the unique considerations associated with IoT and OT.
Think about risk, apply controls first in the areas of highest risk for your use case.
