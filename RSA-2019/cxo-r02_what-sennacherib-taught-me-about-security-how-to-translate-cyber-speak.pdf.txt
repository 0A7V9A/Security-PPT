Cybersecurity and Cuneiform, Seriously?

Both...
­ Begin with `C' ­ Are incomprehensible to many ­ Require "translation services" for non-experts to understand ­ ...including Why It Matters

And...
­ Cybersecurity is too important to be left to experts
­ "Translation" may also cause us to think and talk about security differently
o ...leading to "Eureka!" moments

Translate, Please...

(Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. (Isaiah 36:1))

A History Lesson: Sennacherib's Siege of Jerusalem
Described in the Bible (Isaiah, 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles)
Well-attested outside the Bible
­ Siege of Lachish (British Museum reliefs from Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh)
­ Described on three cuneiform prisms (Taylor, Oriental Institute, Jerusalem)
­ Archeological evidence (e.g., Siloam Tunnel to Gihon Spring, Jerusalem)

Takeaways
Stories and analogies have meaning for people Stories can illustrate lasting truths, even about ephemeral topics (like much of technology) Stories can help translate complexity into ideas people "get" Stories can reinforce desired cultural norms All of which are really important when we are talking about cybersecurity...

Some Caveats Before We Begin
Technical knowledge is important
­ "You gotta know the territory!" ­ "Double XOR ­ twice as strong as XOR!" ­ Using analogies helps you understand what you just
learned about the geeky bits
Examples herein I've used successfully
­ Abject failures are conveniently omitted...

My Own Experiences...

"You can't add rebar after the concrete has set..." "Closed, not a bug..." "Why would anybody do that?" LDAP and obsession "This is bad..." "Our own IT department wouldn't accept this risk..."

Pulling It All Together...
· The military has a lot to teach us about cultural ethos, defensibility and "the battlefield"
· ...which can transform the way we think about, talk about and change cybersecurity...

Changing the Battlefield:
Innate Defensibility of Software
What we build can and will change the network battlefield "Every Marine a rifleman..."
­ Marines are a lethal fighting force with a strong warrior ethos ­ Marines "assume an enemy" and prepare for war ­ ...including the next war
Implications
­ Each developer must be personally responsible for the security of his/her code
­ Products must self defend, every one of them ­ Mentality shift in development to disallowing every other possible
future use instead of allowing all possible future uses
Presenter's Company Logo ­ replace or

18#RSAC
Changing the Battlefield:
Self-Awareness of the Network (1)
Lack of situational awareness is caused by lack of basic information
­ Who's on my network? ­ What is on my network? ­ What is my "mission readiness" (performance, bandwidth,
security posture)
Causes
­ You can't correlate non-existing data ­ Some standards for threat information exchange ­ Value add is the BI component, not "translation services"

19#RSAC
Changing the Battlefield:
Self-Awareness of the Network (2)
Government could enforce such standards as a public good
­ Example: Transcontinental Railroad ­ Or find other ways (procurement, "certifications") to force the market to
provide situational awareness
Could enable "dynamic redoubts"
­ Lessons from the defense of Rorke's Drift ­ Reconfiguring networks and products that go to "DEFCON-n" when
under attack ­ ...because attacks are automated, defenses may need to be automated,
also

20#RSAC
Changing the Battlefield:
Innate Defensibility of Data
"He who defends everything defends nothing." - Frederick the Great
Search (and-destroy) engines?
­ The corollary to information lifecycle management is what you should not have/use/keep
­ GDPR may provide an incentive for automated data destruction
o Might also be a market differentiator
More flexible access models?
­ Self sealing/time-to-live data (SnapChat-ish) ­ Narrow risk/attack vector through more contextual access (time of
day/pattern of use/who do I think you are/what device are you using)

21#RSAC
Changing the Battlefield:
E-M Theory Applied to Networks
Fighter pilots "win" based on agility (Boyd's energymaneuverability (E-M) theory) OODA (observe, orient, decide, act)
­ OODA was an air warfare concept that changed the face of war (notably in Gulf War I)
­ And has been applied to other disciplines ­ Is there applicability to cyber-offense and defense?

Conclusions
"There is nothing new under the sun" Use stories to tell a story! Security is not just about technology, but also:
­ ...helping people understand fundamental principles, concerns and remedies
­ ...reinforcing security as a cultural norm ­ ...and knowing the limits of technology
