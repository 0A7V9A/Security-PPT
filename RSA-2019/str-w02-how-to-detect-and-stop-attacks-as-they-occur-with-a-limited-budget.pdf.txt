#RSAC
Guidelines
No product recommendations No company mentions
­ If I slip up, don't read anything into the mention
People, technical capabilities and integration only
2

#RSAC
Why?
Average time to detect an attack ­ hundreds of days High cost of a full remediation High cost of lost intellectual property High cost of business downtime Detect an attack sooner -> less cost Let's get detection time down to 300 seconds

#RSAC
True story!
Red team attack
4

#RSAC
Another true story!
Interactive attackers breach a remote office, then move laterally
5

#RSAC
Capabilities to enable quick response
6

#RSAC
People
Choose them well Train them well Rotate duties over time
7

#RSAC
Endpoint Telemetry
More than event logs and Antivirus Fine details Searches against these fine details for suspicious behavior
8

#RSAC
Network monitoring
Egress East-west For segments and endpoints without endpoint telemetry
9

#RSAC
Bring it all together
SIEM for correlation and analysis Alerts from endpoint and network
­ Possibly raw endpoint telemetry as well
Enriched and more data from other log sources
­ DNS, DHCP, Windows events, Firewall, Web Proxy
10

#RSAC
Bring it all together (continued)
Other tools
­ Netflow analysis and analytics ­ User Behavior Analytics
Alert when you haven't heard from a data source for a time Priority alerts from critical devices and infrastructure
11

#RSAC
Antivirus/Next Gen Antivirus
These product categories are merging Use them to block the commodity attacks, so your team can focus on the sophisticated attacks and anomalies that might indicate reconnaissance or an attack
12

#RSAC
Controls
Application whitelist Network segment "lock"
13

#RSAC
People multipliers
Let your team think about real attacks, and how to change architecture to prevent in the future Define normal for your environment Endpoint and network tools tuned -> increased signal/noise Consider outsourcing some analysis Automation Threat intel informs where and how to look
14

#RSAC
Cloud monitoring
Often this is an extension of your corporate environment Where you can, treat cloud endpoints as "normal" endpoints Ingest application use, user activity, and security logs CASB logs
15

#RSAC
Challenges
Opaque alerts ("There's something bad, over there. Sorry, no details.") Machine learning appears to be over-hyped
16

Put together a detection and response system that fits you
Some assembly and customization required!

What to do in the next n days
30 days
­ Know your environment, and your visibility ­ Understand the surprises found ­ Present surprises to senior management, and get budget to fix, or an explicit
acceptance of the business risk by the Executives and Board of Directors. ­ Review the capabilities of your team, and your hiring process ­ Compare Endpoint telemetry tools features; schedule demo
60 days
­ Evaluate one or more endpoint telemetry tools
90 days
­ Deploy endpoint telemetry tool ­ Test with purple team
