Enterprise-Scale Vulnerability Management
100s of products to manage 100s of sources of threat intel 1000s of vulnerabilities to investigate ... and many strained relationships

#RSAC
Risk Landscape is ALWAYS Changing
Discovery rate/public announcement of vulnerabilities are unpredictable
2017 ­ 2018 growth
­ 23% more investigations ­ 200% increase in vulnerabilities per investigation ­ 56% more defects filed ­ 50% more customer vulnerability inquiries

Audience Poll Questions

#RSAC
Poll the Audience

#RSAC
Poll the Audience
ASD-R03 Is security debt included as part of your software quality checkpoint?

FIX THAT VULN!!! IT'S A SUPER BAD, CRITICAL SHOWSTOPPER

#RSAC
Why the Release Process is Sometimes 'Security Challenged'

#RSAC
The Reality of why all Software Releases are Important

You are either here ...

OR, you are here ...

How to WIN Patches and Influence Developers

#RSAC
Prep: What is Security-Ready?
Customer reported issues: Public? Stuff? All fixed? Any coordinated disclosure vulnerabilities currently in flight? OSS security debt? Have security fixes been pulled into the release branch?
­ A fix in the build is better than two in the repository

#RSAC
Step 1: Who's Your Release Owner?
Release owner strives for timeliness ... AND quality!
Teach them the vulnerability management lifecycle Ask: How much of the software release is for security? Don't cry wolf every time (unless there is a wolf)

#RSAC
Step 2: Integrate Security Into Your own Software Quality Checkpoint
Establish leadership support to use security as a control Define your risk threshold (pass/fail criteria) Outline exception process (waiver) Tag vulnerabilities for ease of identification and tracking You need templates and standardization!

#RSAC
Step 3: Identify a Common Language
What is a vulnerability? (define it!)
­ Define based on risk to your customers, stakeholders, partners and brand
Assess risk level definitions
­ Agree on what "critical" really means
Ensure security and development are able to agree on prioritization of fixes, and what happens when they don't (we fail them!)

#RSAC
Step 4: Regular Security Control Metrics Touchpoint
Don't rely on your counterparts to look for security issues Share information on a regular cadence so that security debt has visibility Open and frequent dialogue shows dedication to the product, and support for the release's success

#RSAC
Day of Software Release Quality Checkpoint
Understand the security posture of each software release What's changed since the day of the build? You've discovered risk and liability that impacts the build, now how do you manage that until the next release? Do you ask for a respin?

Create your OWN Software Security Review Process

#RSAC
It's a Matter of Process: Review and Get Started
Review your software release process
­ Is the process uniform across the company? ­ Does each release have security criteria? ­ Is it compliance based or opt-in?
Find your release/security champion
­ Influence the influencer ­ Teach them the unpredictability of the vulnerability landscape
Close the GAPs
­ Compliance to process over ad-hoc escalation ­ Define the exception policy

#RSAC
It's a Matter of Process Continued: Review and Get Started
Standardize criteria and decision making
­ Track exceptions for future reference ­ Exceptions must be well documented
Measure compliance at the business level
­ Are all lines of business yielding similar results? ­ Continue to target the under performers

#RSAC
Expect the Bump-in-the-Night!
Threat landscape is unpredictable ­ there is no Patch Tuesday for OSS!
­ Difficulties with multi-party disclosure ­ Weighing business priorities and technical risk (who will own the
liability?) ­ Tracking fix commitments ­ keeping business units honest ­ Standardizing process between business units ­ Managing relationships

#RSAC
Defenders are a Small Community
Highly sought after content There's no playbook We need more of you to share your process, templates, etc.
