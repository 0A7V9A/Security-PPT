legal risk ... In some cases, researchers avoided working with devices and systems protected by access controls to eliminate the legal risks stemming from the DMCA" (CDT, 2018).
"Half of the interview subjects reported the CFAA as a primary source of risk. Of those, more than half reported avoiding some or all types of research that might implicate the CFAA" (CDT, 2018).
A survey of more than 100 security researchers finding 22% of them mentioned they were threatened with legal action (Gamero-Garrido et al. 2017).
"The threat of legal action was cited by 60% of 414 researchers surveyed as a reason they might not work with a vendor to disclose" (NIST, 2015).

CA IoT Security Law (1/1/2019).

"A manufacturer of a connected device shall equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that is appropriate to the nature and function of the device; to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit; and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access,
destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

if a connected device is equipped with a means for authentication outside a local area network, it shall be deemed a reasonable security feature under if either:
­ (1) The preprogrammed password is unique to each device manufactured. ­ (2) The device contains a security feature that requires a user to generate a new means of
authentication before access is granted to the device for the first time.

"Manufacturer" means the person who manufactures, or contracts with another person to manufacture on the person's behalf, connected devices that are sold or offered for sale in California.

Not construed to impose "any duty upon the manufacturer of a connected device related to unaffiliated third-party software or applications that a user chooses".
