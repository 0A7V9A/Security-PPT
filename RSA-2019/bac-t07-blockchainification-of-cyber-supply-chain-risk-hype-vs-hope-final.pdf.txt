Blockchain?
"...distributed ... ledgers of ... transactions ... cryptographically linked ... after validation and a consensus decision...."

Cyber Supply Chain Risk?
"risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems and reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation."
- OMB A-130

What does it all mean?

How is / could blockchain be used... really?

­ Visibility

­ Traceability

­ Automation

­ Security

­ Usability & Cost-Savings

For each:
p What problem do blockchain solutions hope to solve + How the blockchain could potentially help - What the blockchain does not do ? Possible solutions or opportunities

6

One Tool to Rule Them All!

1/5: Visibility
p No visibility = no control + Shared ledger - Scalability - Privacy - Completeness ? Required Participation ? Automation

2/5: Traceability
p Who made this? + Tamper-evident + Semi-permanent + Detailed & precise - Assimilation - Interoperability ? Standardized interplay

4/5: Security
p Tampering, theft, etc. + Cryptographic foundation + No single point of failure + Means to trust the untrusted - Trust - Contract code validity ? Validate participants

Summary
Blockchain is a supply chain of data. The further we get from its intended purpose... Are there opportunities for use in C-SCRM? What can we learn from the hype?

Homework: Apply What You Have Learned
Next week:
­ Are you drinking snake oil?
Next three months:
­ Do you have a use-case? ­ What are you looking to achieve?
Within six months:
­ Plan your blockchain strategy ­ Plan your research & development strategy
