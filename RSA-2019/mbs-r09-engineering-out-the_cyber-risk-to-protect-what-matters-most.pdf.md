Engineering as a Bridge

Engineering is unique as a linking discipline:
­ To the world of science
­ To the world of technology and society
­ As a source of innovation/economy

- Venkatesh "Venky" Narayanamurti, Former Harvard Dean, School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS),

Why Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE)?
Because traditional engineering methods do not account for cyber risk
And engineering curriculums do not include cyber
And bolt-on IT security solutions do not work well for digital industrial control systems
Sees potential to "engineer-out" many security risks

What is CIE?
Definition: Including an awareness of cyber security challenges in the engineering process of digital and non-digital systems
What is it?: A philosophy for characterizing the risks presented by digital technologies
Objective: Promulgation of an updated engineering strategy, informed by an acute awareness of the cyber threats, with engineering-based methods for mitigating such risks

#RSAC
Applied CIE Example: Design Simplification
Reduce design to minimum necessary Be aware of latent functionality Consider non-digital technology where it fits Use ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) as a metaphor

How to Begin to Apply CIE Concepts

Sooner:
­ Contact INL for a specific briefing ­ Grab the Cyber-informed Engineering technical report:
https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1369373-cyber-informed-engineering ­ Begin to socialize with engineers/operators and cyber security
specialists planning projects
Later:
­ If interested, contact INL for help inculcating into ongoing projects ­ Be on the lookout for future research enriching CIE to apply to new
technology development and to provide richer tools to implementers

1st Harvest: Consequence-driven Cyber-informed

#RSAC

Engineering (CCE)

Acknowledges breaches ongoing at critical infrastructure orgs

Admits even the best cyber hygiene doesn't stop certain adversaries

Posits engineering solutions to block or limit the consequences of attackers' best efforts

How to Begin to Apply CCE Concepts

Sooner:
­ Begin to socialize HBR concepts with senior leaders and engineer/operators
­ Keep an eye open for the Getting Started with CCE guide
Later:
­ Read the Intro to CCE book for practitioners, expected publication date: 2H2020
­ If interested, contact INL for potential 2-day orientation engagement
