Risk assessment

Magic level : risk assessment by experience

Knowledge

External security required

Understanding level : risk assessment by knowledge

Practice

External security still needed

Expert level : risk assessment by practice, security ownership

Relevance for IoT trustmodel (currently): undefined
! Centralized models will not work in the IoT context
! Best practice: Certificate transparency (CT)
Authenticity and integrity can be validated Distributed!

Innovative approach
Subscription Manager enables flexible, secure and efficient choice of connectivity provider for (I)IoT devices In combination with the newly specified Secure Element Management Service (SEMS) by Global Platform (I)IoT devices can be
­ Managed in groups using special certificates ­ Securely provisioned with new applications via app stores
Benefits:
­ Post-issuance remote control of (I)IoT device connectivity ­ Reduction of secure element content management costs
 Disruptive change of traditional management model

#RSAC
Mastering IoT security
 Train R&D about hacks & design with security  Complement IT security with OT security  Look for OT security products, manageable by OT staff
7

#RSAC
Relevance for IoT trustmodel (to be defined): distributed
! Trust in IoT: Elements need to interact spontaneously Hence trust building needs to be decentralized

What You Have Learned Today
IoT is a security challenge Cybersecurity is a race, between those who make "doors" and "locks", and those who attempt to break them. But, innovative solutions are available
