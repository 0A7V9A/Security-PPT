Actions for you!
Ask your organization why you aren't part of CTA. Adversary Playbook development is public and available on github. Start looking at what data you have that can help to complete or enhance playbooks as they unfold. What other ways can your organization share information and work towards adversary disruption? Reach out to the women in your organization for diverse perspectives and incredible problem solving skills.
