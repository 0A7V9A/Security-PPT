Four New IoT Challenges for Privacy and Security
1. Intimacy of Devices and Data
Fun Facts about Millennials
­ 83% sleep with their phones ­ 90% check first thing in morning ­ 1 in 3 use in bathroom

1. Intimacy of Devices and Data
Fun Facts about Millennials
­ 83% sleep with their phones ­ 90% check first thing in morning ­ 1 in 3 use in bathroom
Our smartphones already know:
­ Who we know, where we go, what we like

1. Intimacy of Devices and Data
Fun Facts about Millennials
­ 83% sleep with their phones ­ 90% check first thing in morning ­ 1 in 3 use in bathroom
Our smartphones already know:
­ Who we know, where we go, what we like
Will only become more intimate with IoT
­ This also means new kinds of intrusive ads, data breaches, accidental data sharing

2. Physical Safety
Today, main problem is data breaches Tomorrow, huge potential for many nasty scenarios
­ Many new kinds of ransomware we haven't imagined yet
o Malware that locks people out of their houses o Malware that turns off thermostats in winter --> burst pipes
­ Holding people and society virtually hostage
o Autonomous drones or vehicles deliberately crashing into things o Implanted medical devices giving or receiving fake data

3. Awareness of Devices
In my first year teaching at Carnegie Mellon, met with students in their lab Didn't know until end of semester we were being broadcast on Internet the entire time!
­ Do you see the camera?

3. Awareness of Devices
More and more devices will be hard to notice Ex. Mites "supersensor" under development at Carnegie Mellon
See http://mites.io

4. Complexity and Scale
Lots of unexpected and emergent behaviors

How to Address These Privacy and Security Issues?
Better technical approaches
­ Operating systems, networking, programming languages
Better UX design
­ Better disclosures, awareness of devices, controls, decision making
Better developer support
­ Most developers are C students ­ Tools, education, best practices for privacy and security
Better laws, policies, and standards
­ Mandatory cybersecurity insurance for manufacturers ­ Tools to help policy makers, journalists, product reviewers

How to Address These Privacy and Security Issues?
Operating Systems
Our team is developing an open source IoT Hub
­ Think of it as a smarter WiFi router that protects IoT devices
How far can we go if devices have simple metadata?
­ Ex. Here is my URL for software updates ­ Ex. Here is my Manufacturer Usage Description (MUDs)
o Whitelist: this lightbulb communicates only with lights.intel.com
What basic services can IoT Hub offer for all devices?
­ Ex. Disallow remote login for devices if well-known default password ­ Ex. Centralize telemetry and learn patterns

How to Address These Privacy and Security Issues?
Awareness of Devices
Our team looking at physical dimension of IoT privacy
­ Ex. Make it easy to see where camera is and where it's pointed ­ Want something cheap (so manufacturers will adopt) and effective ­ Testing out LEDs, audio, virtual maps

LEDs off

If device has camera -> LED on

Summary
IoT poses many new challenges to privacy and security
­ Ex. Intimacy, physical security, awareness, complexity
Existing approaches for privacy and security insufficient
­ Will require innovations in tech, UX, education, legal, standards
We're not going to have many second chances for IoT, and business as usual will be disastrous Let's make sure we create a world we would want to live in Contact me at jasonh@cs.cmu.edu
