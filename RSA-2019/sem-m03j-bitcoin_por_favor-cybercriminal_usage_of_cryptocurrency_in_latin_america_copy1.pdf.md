Deep and Dark Web

11

#RSAC
Mexico
· No dedicated cybercrime laws · Cryptocurrencies are legal and FINTECH companies gain
approval. · The Central Bank has not announced which
cryptocurrencies are legal
12

#RSAC
Colombia
· Cryptocurrencies do not constitute a legal form of payment
· Cryptocurrencies have been declared illegal · Not protected by any guarantee or deposit insurance
13

#RSAC
Argentina
· Not legal tender · They are not regulated · Treated as goods under the nation's Civil Code
14

Venezuela is the Ideal Case for Legitimate Use of #RSAC Cryptocurrencies
· Citizens have distrust of regional banks · Cryptocurrencies enables trust financial sovereignty to
individuals, perhaps outside of regional institutions · Venezuela
· Allows an independence which may not have been previously offered through conventional regional currencies due to weak or nonexistent infrastructures
15

#RSAC
Venezuela
· Currency controls on the Bolivar · Increasing inflation · Lack of international bank accounts from most citizens,
making cryptocurrency a viable option · Exchange controls force Venezuelan banks to only use the
local currency · Increased activity from local bitcoins, a
cryptocurrency-to-payment card service
16

Constituent Decree on the Integral System of

#RSAC

Crypto Assets

· "Venezuela's "Constituent Decree on the Integral System of Crypto Assets" has been published in the country's official gazette. The decree establishing the legal framework for cryptocurrencies and all related activities contains 63 articles; it entered into force with the publication in the gazette."

Legitimate Payment Processors
Fraudulent Use of Payment Processors

#RSAC
Cybercrime Payment Processors
· Which is the most popular for fraud? · What is accepted? What is solicited? · Cashing out
· When a threat actor transfers money from a compromised account ­ for example Venmo, PayPal, or bank accounts ­ to another account, usually one that is controlled by the threat actor.

Graph of Mentions of Payment Processors in Deep #RSAC and Dark Web Spanish Language Forums
Both Neteller and Skrill appear to be widely discussed in the DDW. Both services are online payment systems that also offer limited services for users to exchange cryptocurrency for USD.

Deep and Dark Web Activity
Popular Cryptocurrencies

#RSAC
Global Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies
· The perceived anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, and their increasing valuation has led cybercriminals to adopt them as their primary method of payment.
· Cryptocurrencies are additionally being leveraged to provide additional revenue streams through ransomware and cryptojacking campaigns.
· Although not as sophisticated in their campaigns, there has been an observable uptick in the interest of cryptocurrencies within the Latin American cybercriminal underground. Though the growth has not been consistent to other geographical locations.

Payment Preference for DDW Vendor
· Another well recognized Latin American vendor with over 1000 transactions (according to the fraud forum) appears to accept Bitcoin, Western Union, and OXXO payments to carry out refund fraud.
After carrying out an in-depth conversation with the threat actor they explained that most of the payments for their services tend to be Western Union and National Banks. The researchers were able to corroborate after conducting blockchain analysis in the actor's wallet.

#RSAC
Payment Preference for DDW Vendor
· Vendors across the Latin American Deep and Dark Web often use a large array of payment methods including cryptocurrencies, national and international bank transfers, as well as a large array of payment processors.
Moderator of a well known Latin American carding forum accepts a large array of payment methods for illicitly obtained flights.
31

#RSAC
Spanish Speaking Dark Net Vendors
· Spanish speaking threat actors operating on Dark Web marketplaces such as Dream Market and AlphaBay Market have to carry out transactions with cryptocurrencies due to the markets' enforcement.
· Most DDW vendors, even if Latin American, will list their products in English; potentially obfuscating their country of origin and getting a larger market share.
32

#RSAC
Just Another Payment Method
· It appears that Latin American threat actor vendors utilize cryptocurrencies just as an additional method to sell their products.
· If a potential customer is only interested in purchasing goods and services with cryptocurrencies, vendors will give them that option.
· However, it is clear that due to the fact that they also offer regular payment methods in addition to cryptocurrencies, that the latter option is meant as an additional option and not a necessity.
33

#RSAC
Bitcoins in Brazil
· Brazil, while Portuguese language, has a fairly sophisticated cybercrime ecosystem
· This recent conversation from a dark web version of Reddit demonstrates current cryptocurrency mentality
34

Summary
What have we learned?

#RSAC
The Case for Non-use of Cryptocurrencies
Deterrence or Acceptance?
· Cryptocurrencies, however, retain connotations and associations with cybercrime
· There are technical barriers to entry that may deter neophytes, or individuals without access to technology
· Lack of regional law enforcement may not deter cybercriminal use of legitimate payment processors, or cryptocurrencies
· Convenience
36

#RSAC
Future Cryptocurrency Use
· Legitimate use of cryptocurrencies within the region will continually be slow, as the volatility of the currency, and lack of regulation, will deter most individuals
· Cybercriminal use of cryptocurrencies will be slow, as convenience trumps security, for most threat actors
· The lack of law enforcement actions regarding cryptocurrencies within the region will permit potential future use, though will likely be accepted as a secondary payment method to more legitimate payment methods
