#RSAC
Hospital Infection Control
· Infection prevention and control (IPC)
§ is a scientific approach and practical solution designed to prevent harm caused by infection to patients and health workers. It is grounded in infectious diseases, epidemiology, social science and health system strengthening.
4

#RSAC
Hospital Infection Control
· Infection Control Specialists
§ work to prevent disease outbreaks from becoming epidemics § focus on preventative actions (encouraging good hygiene, preparing
for an outbreak, etc.) § and respond to outbreaks in progress

#RSAC
The Overlap
Cyber security professionals and hospital infection control practitioners perform similar roles in very different environments...
6

The Overlap
Cyber security professionals and hospital infection control practitioners perform
similar roles:

#RSAC
· Phases: Prevention, Detection, Response
· Penalties: regulatory, financial, public perception/reputation
· Surveillance system design · Infrastructure to aid prevention · Behaviors of individuals/end-users · Agility needed to keep atop threats · Global scale

7

#RSAC
The Big Differences
· Expected Impact:
§ Healthcare: Loss of life/health is possible or probable
§ Cybersecurity: Financial/reputational damage is most probable
· Types of Threats:
§ Healthcare: All threats are self-spreading, infectious diseases
§ Cybersecurity: Only a subset of computer viruses are "worms"

A Brief History of Infection Control
· Wait and see · Witch burning/folk remedies · Quarantine · Individual treatment · Immunization · Preventative treatment · Individualized/genetics-based treatment

What's the Problem?

#RSAC
· Anyone admitted to a hospital has a 5% chance of contracting an HAI.
· The hospital length of stay increases by 17.6 days when patients get an HAI.
· Nearly 99,000 people die in the United States annually from HAIs; this is more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.
· Around 9.4% of inpatient costs are HAI-related. · HAIs cost the healthcare system around $35
billion per year.
· HAIs account for $1,100 per patient admission.

#RSAC
The Scope of the Cyber Threat
· Today, 1 in 13 web requests lead to
malware (Up 3% from 2016). (Symantec)
· Malware and web-based attacks are the two most costly attack types -- companies
spent an average of US $2.4 million in
defense. (Accenture)
12

#RSAC
The Scope of the Cyber Threat
· 69% of organizations don't believe the
threats they're seeing can be blocked by their anti-virus software. (Ponemon Institute's
2017 Cost of Data Breach Study)
· By 2020, we expect IT analysts covering
cybersecurity will be predicting five-year spending forecasts (to 2025) at well over
$1 trillion. (Cybersecurity Ventures)

Case Study

WannaCry vs. Ebola

2017-Present

2014 ­ 2016 outbreak

#RSAC
Case Study: WannaCry vs. Ebola

WannaCry 2017-Present

Ebola, 2014 ­ 2016 outbreak

· Organizations poorly prepared to deal with worm using NSA exploits
· Discovery of a "kill switch" enabled propagation to be controlled

· Long period to identify Ebola in an unexpected location
· Poor public health infrastructure and resources to control propagation

15

#RSAC
Case Study: WannaCry vs. Ebola

WannaCry 2017-Present
· Traditional cybersecurity policies and procedures harmful to managing the outbreak
· Use of outdated technology helped enable the worm to propagate
· Current device patching methodologies need a redesign

Ebola, 2014 ­ 2016 outbreak
· US Healthcare system inadequately trained/prepared (e.g., Dallas)
· CDC with delayed and perpetually updated guidance
· Personal protective equipment challenging and needs redesign

16

Case Study

Business Email

vs. Typhoid Mary

Compromise

#RSAC
Case Study: BEC vs. Typhoid Mary

Business Email Compromise

Typhoid Mary

· Targets employees in positions of power or influence
· Victims commonly believe that it couldn't/didn't happen to them
· Often, BEC attacks are aimed at compromising other targets using the victim's trusted account

· Worked as a chef, which enabled spread of the bacteria
· Mary Mallon never believed that she was a typhoid carrier
· Mary Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier and exhibited no symptoms

18

#RSAC
Case Study: BEC vs. Typhoid Mary

Business Email Compromise

Typhoid Mary

· User's poor email security habits lead to compromise
· Users often return to old habits after a breach

· Failure to wash hands increases the probability of typhoid infection
· Mallon took a position as a cook under a false name after promising not to

The State of Cyber Hygiene
· 90% of cyber breach claims were caused by human error1
· 91% of successful cyberattacks start with a spear phishing email2

21

#RSAC
The State of Cyber Hygiene
· In 2017, spear-phishing emails were the most widely used infection vector, employed by 71% of those groups that staged cyber attacks. (Symantec)
· 65% of companies have over 500 users who are never prompted to change their passwords. (Varonis)
22

#RSAC
Takeaways
· Both the medical and cybersecurity fields have issues arising from poor user hygiene
· The lack of global epidemics means they're doing something right
· What can we apply from hospital infection control to our field?
23

How Do We Solve It?

#RSAC
How is Physical Hygiene Promoted?
· Gentle reminders (signs, etc.)
· Proactive gestures (providing hand sanitizer, wipes, etc.)
· Regular checkups
· Incentives for preventions (health awareness programs, etc.)
25

#RSAC
How Can We Improve Cyber Hygiene?
· Gentle reminders (signs, etc.)
· Proactive gestures (providing free USB drives, AV subscriptions, etc.)
· Regular checkups
· Incentives for preventions (cyber health awareness programs, etc.)
26

#RSAC
Effective Cybersecurity Training

Has to be relatable

Has to account for culture
27

Has to be human centric not policy
centric

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
§ Evaluate how your organization is promoting good cyber hygiene
§ Identify aspects of your organization's cybersecurity strategy where behavior change is necessary but difficult
28

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
§ Create user stories mapping good cybersecurity hygiene to good personal hygiene
§ Develop a strategy for building training focused on behavioral change
§ Identify and produce low-cost, high-impact cyber hygiene aids
29

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
