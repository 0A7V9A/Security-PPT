1939: three circumstances that enabled them to solve ENIGMA.
1. Double encoding of the message key
2. The cryptographers' preference for certain
specific message keys such as AAA, ABC, etc.
3. General Bertand's acquisition of the daily key for the months of September & October 1932

Understanding the Challenges

#RSAC
Don't care? Don't know?
Security tasks and costs are not acceptable because there is no benefit. Avoidance and risk-taking.
Can't use?
People understand the benefits but either cannot identify the correct technology or can not use it

Ensure that we would not harm the participants by locking them out of their accounts Ensure that they had the contact information of the team and a specific researcher before they left Offer them the security keys as a token of appreciation for their participation

No one responded or showed any sign of using the Yubico security keys

They discussed they do not find any value by using the keys to secure their accounts

"No, my password is secure enough and alerts are active." "Why is it still asking for a password?"
"use it out of curiosity, [as it] might not be practical."
well... I don't really understand the point of the key if I still need to enter my username and password." "Probably not [on] Gmail is not important. Would have used for work". "For my use, No, it is inconvenient to use. The reason is that I don't have any sensitive information."

The Yubico security key is a 2FA device designed to be user friendly. We examined the usability of the device by implementing a think-aloud #RSAC protocol, and documented the halt and confusion points. We provided this analysis to Yubico, who implemented many of the recommended
Wall of Text changes. We then repeated the study in the same context; noting significant improvements in usability. However, increase in usability did not
affect the acceptability of the device, affecting the prolonged usage of the device. In both phases we interviewed the study participants about the acceptability of the device, finding similar concerns about lack of benefits and the invisibility of risk. A source of opposition to adoption is the concern for loss of access, with participants prioritizing availability over confidentiality. Another concern is that these do not lessen or simplify interaction with services as passwords are still required. We close with open questions for additional research, and further recommendations to encourage online safety through the adoption of 2FA. We analyzed acceptability and usability of the Yubico security key, a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) hardware token implementing FIDO. This token has notable usability attributes: tactile interaction, convenient form factor, physical resilience, and the design goal of ease of use. Despite the Yubico security key being among best in class for usability, participants in a think-aloud protocol still encountered several difficulties in use. Based on these findings, we proposed design changes, some of which Yubico adopted. We repeated the experiment, showing that these recommendations enhanced ease of use but not necessarily acceptability. With the primary halt points mitigated, we could identify the principal remaining reasons for rejecting 2FA. These reasons were the fear of losing the device and perceptions that there is no individual risk of account takeover. Our results illustrate both the importance and limits of usability on acceptability, adoption, and adherence in two-factor authentication. %The risk of loss of availability was perceived as greater than the risk of loss of control. Participants believed that their passwords were strong enough, and that their accounts were sufficiently secured by their own acumen. We report on both experiments, and detail the progress between them. Our results illustrate both the importance and limits of usability on acceptability, adoption, and adherence in two-factor authentication. Specifically, we implemented a think-aloud protocol to identify stop points, perceived benefits, and perceived costs. We reported the findings along with recommendations to Yubico and documented the consequent changes for a second iteration of the study implementing these modifications. We focused on participants with above average technical literacy by recruiting students from STEM degree programs. Our goal was to identify difficulties that might be barriers to Adoption for technically literate participants, particularly those who were likely to use GitHub, DropBox, or other sharing platforms. We conducted the entire experiment in two-phases. In both the phases we asked the participants to configure a FIDO U2F security key for their Google account. Significant improvements in usability were noted in Phase-II over Phase-I. However, the overall acceptability did not change.
Subsequently, we provided additional recommendations, such as confirm37ation of successful completion of the login, and the need to

Smoking is a factor which contributes to lung cancer. Most cancers that start in lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas that derive from epithelial cells. Depending on the type of tumor, so-called paraneoplastic phenomena may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome (muscle weakness due to auto-antibodies), hyperkalemia, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Tumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to changed sweating patterns and eye muscle problems (a combination known as Horner's syndrome) as well as muscle weakness in the hands due to invasion of the brachial plexus.
