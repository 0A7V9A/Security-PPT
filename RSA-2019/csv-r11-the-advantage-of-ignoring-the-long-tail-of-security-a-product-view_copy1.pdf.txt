Product considerations

#RSAC
Honeywell Buildings Technology

· We currently serve 25% of all buildings in the world
· 1,000s of products that depend on the cloud service providers · 100s of cloud subscriptions and millions of resources
· Millions of hardware end-points (IOT), handheld devices, and more with orchestration between fixed locations and the cloud
· Ongoing Challenge ­ Deliver to market expectations, regulations, and a brand of trust ­ Heavy evolution in our space ­ Transformation of technology available in our space and utility ­ Churn in regulation and geo-political relations impact our supply chain

What is the long tail of security controls
Practicality and focus

Long Tail of Security Controls

Send feedback to @jdeluccia on twitter

#RSAC

Refers to the value (impact) of security control compared against all other controls
Viewpoints and analysis are best done in house:
· Reflective of your product · Customer use cases · Technology truths

Long Tail of Security Controls
· Take a pragmatic view of your products, tooling, and platforms. Then apply a deployment priority that demands the table steaks first, and then allows for incremental expansions.

Demonstrative Organizational Roles & Priority
DO GOOD GIVE YOUR TIME HELP OUR WORLD

#RSAC
PROGRAM Backbone - Standards

Demonstrative Examples:

· IOT/IIOT = ISA/IEC 62443 , (DRAFT) NIST IOT Baseline

· Cloud = CSA STAR, SOC 2 Type 2.

· Product or Process Certifications = ISASecure, UL 29001

· People = CSSLP, Ethical Hacker, CCSK, CCSP, CISSP + ISA/IEC 62443 Cybersecurity certificates

· SSDL = Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle

Together these guide our core controls

5. Live with your developers, residents vs. guests
· Be a part of the Product Planning and design discussions · JOIN daily stand-ups and sprints · Embrace their development cycles · Deploy Architects to development teams to build together · Mutually accountable for product delivery and success

4. Invent and create alternatives
· You are not a robot, yet ... · Adapt cybersecurity requirements to the actual world · Set infrastructure; intent & guidance
­ Limit cognitive dissonance with choices (NetFlix) ­ Platforms and shared components  Cyber security helps source

3. Track, Log exceptions, and escalate
· Code evolves and gets reused, thus our tickets allow us to keep practicality match to new truths.
­ Assumptions evolve ­ Client environments change ­ Scope of product impact shifts
· All impact risk management and mitigation considerations · All exceptions go beyond the security architect on the project:
­ Product Security Leaders ­ Chief Technology Officers (monthly)

2. Build and scale your knowledge with broader

engineering

· Create the Passionate Few across the engineering organization
­ Individuals not owned by Cyber or matrixed into cyber ­ Give them training and free resources to develop their skill sets ­ Support and over deliver on growing their careers
· We are not creating cybersecurity professionals, we are making the engineering teams better

1. We must evolve too
· Our programs must also constantly evolve
­ Weekly track our security metrics across all phases, programs, and work with escalations directly
­ Monthly review over entire governance, documentation (training, and operational wikis), and make updates broadly
­ Sit with our engineers, participate in planning at the business and product level (early identify skill sets and tools we need)
­ Report up to the CTO and CEO level; risks to act on, and customer impact
­ Annually we globally get together for deep dives & program updates

Shiny Objects - resist

Long Tail - Foundational vs Shiny Controls Send feedback to @jdeluccia on twitter · High ROI · Foundational Controls · (Encryption, FWs, IAM, quality code, etc..)
· Higher sophistication · Unique operational situations · Shiny objects

History supports that core elemental focus is critical

NOTHING has changed in the past 10 years · OWASP Top 10, · SANS Top 20, · Verizon Data Breach .....top causes of breach remain fairly constant

The right thing is still the right thing

The only variable is are you having to edge more and less practical controls given the platform and customer nuances

Why IGNORING the shiny objects benefits you...
· Allows you to improve on strengths · Resources spent on where we gain the biggest impact · Are we really stopping an APT · Prevents fatigue of cybersecurity in engineering teams · Prevents burn out from cybersecurity team · Brain matter can focus on the organization's custom needs
...... I have found these to disproportionately impactful at Google, Microsoft, and now Honeywell

How can you measure shiny impact needs for your org?
· % of coverage; · probability of impact; · customer event; · are we even using that tech or playing in
that technology space; · is that technology space in play for us now
or near term?

Our focus for tomorrow

#RSAC
What should be our focus over the next few years?
· Supply chain - hardware, software, and partnerships in the market (less isolation and more collaboration)
· Abstraction of services - continued refactoring of code and product stack
· Growth of cybersecurity standards and practices across our sectors
· Elemental security - further expanded

#RSAC
Actions, the most important

· Audit your coverage of security programs with the development of new products (are you involved cradle to grave?)
· Create clarity of security objectives against product types and your own control reference standard
· Connected products establish core basics - 100% vision of resources; automation of scripts that trigger; empower
· Conduct root cause analysis against engineer behaviors to discover cultural manifestations of policy
