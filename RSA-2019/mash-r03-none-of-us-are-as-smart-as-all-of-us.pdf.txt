The basis for this talk
Once upon a time, our industry lacked data We no longer lack data; we're drowning in it Making sense of that data is now our challenge ­ quality, coherence, synthesis, inference, etc. How to we turn abundant data into better decisions?

#RSAC
Toward "Shared Understanding"...
...at the RSA Conference ...in industry reports. ...in meta-analysis ...in original research
How do these help us "climb the pyramid" toward greater shared understanding?

#RSAC
Making sense of the RSA Conference
The slogan of the RSA Conference is "Where the World Talks Security." But have you ever wondered "how" the world talks about security? This report mines a decade's worth (~15,000) of CFP submissions to help answer that question. Updated for this talk with 2019 CFPs!

#RSAC
Declaritive Statements: "blockchain is..."
"Blockchain is a hot technology topic, yet 36% of respondents admit they don't understand its mechanism." "A blockchain is a distributed, verifiable datastore." "A blockchain is a distributed ledger system that records online transactions." "A blockchain is a verifiable transaction database carrying an ordered list of all transactions that ever occurred." "...the only valid blockchain is the one with most blocks in it." "A blockchain is a series of records or transactions, collected together in a block that defines a portion of a ledger." "Blockchain is no magic bullet."

Finding Shared Understanding in Meta-Analysis

#RSAC
Modern meta-analysis
36

#RSAC
Modern meta-analysis
"A systematic review attempts to identify, appraise and synthesize all the empirical evidence that meets pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a given research questions."
Given a Research Question:
Identify sources of evidence Appraise the quality of evidence Aggregate and synthesize evidence (meta-analysis)
