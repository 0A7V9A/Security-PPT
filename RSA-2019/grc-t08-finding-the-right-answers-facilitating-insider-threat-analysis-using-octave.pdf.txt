#RSAC
Can This Happen to Your Organization?

Law Enforcement Employee Performed Unauthorized Queries in Database; Provided Sensitive Information to Domestic and International Acquaintances

Disgruntled Former Employee Compromised Supervisor Credentials to Read Email, View Employee Reviews, Steal IP, and Post Data to Social Media Site(s)

VP of Technology Company Transferred >$19M from Organization to Personal Accounts; Created False Reimbursement Documents for Health Insurance Plan

Assessing Insider Threat with OCTAVE FORTE
All attendees will walk away with a greater appreciation for risk:
Educate + Learn = Apply

We will apply OCTAVE FORTE process to an Insider Threat Risk

You will actively participate with your own
organizational challenges

You will gain practical ideas to manage risk and be
educated on insider threat

Bottom Line: Insider Threat is a critical risk that can be included in most enterprise risk portfolios

In a World of Great Uncertainty
What is Certain?
· Risk environment will not contract ­ number of risks and complexity will increase
· Organizations must get better at "surviving" uncertainty
· Knowledge and awareness of risk issues must be pervasive throughout the organization
· Traditional tools, techniques, and methods may not work and will need to evolve
· Organizations must be agile enough to adapt

#RSAC

OCTAVE's Evolution => FORTE
Accounts for Several Standards to Incorporate
· Leverages many standard principles and best practices
· Facilitated ­ Getting Organizational Input · Operational ­ Real Time Applicability · Risk ­ Establishing a Process to Assess · Tailored ­ Flexible for All Organizations · Enterprise ­ Application at All Levels

#RSAC

#RSAC
Use Case for an Organization...
No Two Organizations are the Same
Suppose you belong to a private, mid-sized company that consults for various industry sectors with sensitive information.

Where to begin...

#RSAC

Think Marathon, NOT Sprint

#RSAC
Most Critical Item to Get Started from Step 1...
Risk Appetite that is Quantitative and Functional

Revenue (Operating Profit)

Safety

Escalate to Executive Attention

Any more than a 10% deviation from planned operating profit for a quarter

Loss of life or permanent disability

Escalate to Management
Attention

Any more than a 5% deviation from planned operating profit for a quarter

Time away or other reportable incident

Operations

Reputation

No more than three Loss of market

days of lost

segment with

operations

multiple customers

No more than one day of lost operation Loss of customer

Compliance Debarrment from a particular market segment linked to regulatory violation(s)
Any fines or other penalties linked to regulatory violation(s)

Human Capital Any more than 5% high performer attrition from any business unit in a quarter Any more than 3% high performer attrition from any business unity in a quarter

Projects
Liquidated damages that exceed contract value
Liquidated damages that erode the margin as sold

Any deviations from

No more than one

Provide Front Line planned operating

shift of lost

Attention profit for a quarter Bumps, strains, bruises operation

Customer complaints Any warnings linked Any developing

or negative social to regulatory

trend in high

media buzz

violation(s)

performer attrition

Minor disputes with limited contractual impact

Appetite May Also be Characterized by Likelihood, Adaptability, and Others

Compressing Effort for Time...
STEP 1: Establish Risk Governance and Appetite

Assume Steps 2-4 are
Completed

STEP 10: Review, Update, & Repeat

STEP 2: Scope Critical Services & Assets

STEP 9: Monitor & Measure Effectiveness

STEP 3: Identify Resilience Requirements
of Assets

STEP 8: Implement Improvement Plan
STEP 7: Plan for Improvement

STEP 4: Measure Current Capabilities
STEP 5: Identify Risks, Threats, & Vulnerabilities to Assets

#RSAC
High Value Asset: People, Information,
Technology, or Facilities of which a High Value Service
is Dependent.

STEP 6: Analyze Risks Against Capabilities

Summary of Results from Steps 2-4
Asset Management and Requirements

People, information, technology, facilities, and external providers are documented
Their contributions to business objectives are understood
Ownership determination is critical

4. Manage Assets
3. Document Assets

#RSAC
1. Plan for Asset
Management
2. Identify Assets

#RSAC
Linking Asset Disruptions to Strategic Objectives
Crossroads of Strategy, Risk, and Operations
Thinking about that day that may never come...

#RSAC
Information Security Risk Management
Risk = Probability (Threat exploits Vulnerability causing Unwanted Outcome) Threat = External, Internal, Human, Non-Human, Malicious, Non-Malicious

Insider Threat Mitigation

Prevent / Detect
if detected
Respond/Recover

Identify / Deter
if detected
Consistent Response

#RSAC
Not Alienate

#RSAC
CERT's Definition of Insider Threat
The potential for an individual who has or had authorized access to an organization's assets to use their access, either maliciously or unintentionally, to act in a way that could negatively affect the organization.

#RSAC
Insider Threat to Critical Assets

#RSAC
The Insider Threat
There are no insider threats that can be characterized as "one type"
Remember that the organization's critical assets include:
· People · Information · Technology · Facilities
Insider threat can be based on the motive(s) of the insider Impacts to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are possible
Cyber Attack = Cyber Impact Physical Attack = Physical Impact
Cyber Attack = Physical Impact Physical Attack = Cyber Impact

Examples of Insider Incidents

National Security Espionage

IT System Sabotage

#RSAC
Theft of IP ­ Entitled Independent

Espionage / Sabotage

Fraud

Theft of IP ­ Ambitious Leader

#RSAC
Insider Threat Observables

The CERT National Insider Threat Center has amassed a repository of over 2500 Insider incidents (over 18 years).

Potential Insider Threat Risk Indicators (not a complete list)

Organizational

Mergers

Acquisitions

Downsizing

Reorganization

Workforce Turnover Workload Promotion

Bonus / Pay Expectations
Organizational Support
Job Engagement

Behavioral

Drug Use

Policy Violations

Mood Swings

Concerning Behaviors

Aggressive Behavior Poor Performance

Absence / Tardiness Sexual Harassment

Technical
Disable Backup Log Modification
Unauthorized Downloads Network Probing

Conflicts (Supervisors)

Conflicts (Co-workers)

Compromised Accounts

Disable AV Unauthorized Accounts Email / USB Usage
Accumulated Privileges Unauthorized Device(s)

Qualifying the Insider Threat
Operations: Insider Driven Disruption
Scope Statement: If the organization suffers a major interruption in operations or impairment from an internal actor, then mission and lives could be jeopardized. Opportunistically, if all malign insider action is avoided, then resources could be saved, reputation could elevate, and mission success could improve.

Risk Triggers and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Layoff(s) for portions of the workforce

Poor Org Performance Policy Changes

Conditions for Risk Realization

Consequences
Additional costs
Delayed mission schedule

Reduction of benefits Poor Org Performance Policy Changes Employee Complaints
Toxic work environment and/or culture
Low Employee Morale Employee Complaints

· Could happen during any operational environment
· Most likely to occur with poor corporate performance

Loss of intellectual property
Loss of information
Reputational damage
Loss of confidentiality, integrity, or access
