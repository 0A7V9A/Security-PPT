#RSAC
Types of Satellite Hacks
Jamming
­ Flooding a communications channel to block information transfer (DDoS)
Eavesdropping
­ Intercepting a communication channel
Hijack
­ Replacing content (not taking over the satellite itself)
Control
­ Taking over the TT&C ground station, bus, or payload

Intrusions into NASA Systems
1997, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, data exfil 1998, US-German ROSAT blinded by unplanned turn towards the Sun (RU) 2002, Huntsville, engine design (CN) 2003 ­ 2006, data exfil propulsion systems 2004, Ames Research supercomputer shut down to halt intrusion 2005, Kennedy VAB. Johnson Space Ctr, data exfil (TW) 2006, NASA HQ, phishing, data exfil satellite design 2006. NASA bans Word attachments 2007, Goddard, EOS network compromised (CN) 2007, Landsat-7 12 minute interference 2008, Landsat-7 another 12+ minute takeover 2008, Terra EOS AM-1, 2+ minute takeover 2008, Terra EOS AM-1, 9+ minute TT&C takeover 2008, Johnson Space Ctr, Trojan disrupted ISS and infected obsolescent on-board computers 2010, seven NASA systems compromised, Chinese national detained 2010, China Telcom routed 15% of Internet traffic through Chinese servers, including .gov and .mil sites 2011, NASA and ESA identity and authentication data hacked and published

Control Takeover Hacks
February 1999, SkyNet, UK. Hackers controlled one of four British military satellites, moving its position and demanding ransom 2000, US Abrams and British Challenger tank trials in Greece meaconed by French intelligence agencies ­ GPS takeover
26

Remediation

#RSAC
Threat-specific Detection and Response
Anti-jamming
­ Spread-spectrum
Hardening
­ EMP and radiation shielding ­ GPS Authentication
Embedded security processor
­ Encryption ­ Digital signing ­ Identity management ­ authentication and authorization
Detection and blocking
28

#RSAC
Systemic Detection and Response
Deploy security orchestration
­ Real-time anomaly detection and response
Apply ISO 7498-2
­ Authentication ­ Authorization ­ Encryption ­ Data Integrity ­ Non-repudiation
Expand monitoring and logging Exploit secure chip architectures
29

#RSAC
Long Term Solutions
View satellite as just another communication channel Use comprehensive information security, privacy, and identity management across appropriate layers Imbed security and privacy by design (both IT and OT)
30

#RSAC
Conclusions and Next Steps
Costs plummeting per Moore's law
­ Both satellite costs and hacker RF attack kit
Attack surfaces widening 5G fringe coverage will require satellites Industrial IoT firmware updates via satellites Private sector regulation required
31

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Extend your information security architecture to include OT ­ and possibly satellites. Upgrade to 13-bit "week" counter by April 6
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Assess the potential value to satellite infrastructure for your Industrial IoT deployments
Within six months you should:
­ Train your architectural, infrastructure, and procurement teams to include enhanced information security criteria in design, deployment, and acquisition
