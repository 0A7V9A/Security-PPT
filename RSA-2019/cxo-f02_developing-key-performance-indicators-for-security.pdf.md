Laying a Foundation
For metrics to be effective, organizations must define their goals
Most organizations have not taken the time to define their intentions for security We need more detailed metrics than "don't get breached"
Before we can define metrics, we have to lay a foundation

#RSAC
An Architecture for Security Program Management
To lay a solid foundation, organizations must:
1. Document a security program charter 2. Empower stakeholders to govern the program 3. Clearly document their intentions (policies) 4. Establish their priorities for defense 5. Create a plan for quality management 6. Define specific measures / metrics for success 7. Regularly report to key stakeholders / leadership

WARNING!
There are no shortcuts!
If organizations skip steps in the process, they are bound for frustration, confusion, and failure It's time for our industry to grow up and do the hard things

#RSAC
Defining Appropriate Controls
Security defenses are generally derived from three places: ­ Regulatory requirements ­ Industry standards ­ Contractual obligations
It is pointless to define measures, if goals have not been defined

Popular Security Control Standards

#RSAC
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls
Official home of the Critical Security Controls Not-for-Profit group responsible for managing the CIS Controls Utilizes a volunteer army of contributors to define defense Responsible for maintaining community efforts such as:
­ Security benchmarks ­ Security metrics ­ CIS Controls ­ Managing the MS-ISAC

The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls (cont)

1. Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets 2. Inventory and Control of Software Assets 3. Continuous Vulnerability Management 4. Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges 5. Secure Configuration for Hardware and
Software on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations, and Servers 6. Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs 7. Email and Web Browser Protections 8. Malware Defenses 9. Limitation and Control of Network Ports, Protocols, and Services 10. Data Recovery Capabilities

11. Secure Configuration for Network Devices, such as Firewalls, Routers, and Switches
12. Boundary Defense 13. Data Protection
14. Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know
15. Wireless Access Control 16. Account Monitoring and Control
17. Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program
18. Application Software Security 19. Incident Response and Management
20. Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises

Key Principles for Version 7.0 & 7.1
1. Improve the consistency and simplify the wording of each sub-control 2. Implement "one ask" per sub-control 3. Bring more focus on multi-factor authentication and application whitelisting 4. Account for improvements in security technology and emerging security
problems 5. Better alignment with other frameworks (e.g., the NIST CSF) 6. Support for the development of related products (e.g. measurements/metrics,
governance, and implementation guides) 7. Definition of control levels based on organizational demographics

Controls, Measures, Metrics, Maturity

Start with Attestations
Start the process with simple interviews There's no reason for a deep dive if the basics are not done

Six Sigma and the CIS Controls
Starting in version 7.0 of the CIS Controls, Six Sigma was adopted to be the quality management program for the controls "Six Sigma is a quality program that, when all is said and done, improves your customer's experience, lowers your costs, and builds better leaders."
-- Jack Welch, GE
Purpose was to define thresholds for maturity for each defined measure Organizations do not need to be perfect, but this allows them to define a standard for what is acceptable risk

The Future of Information Security
Cyber hygiene has been defined We have standards of care
Information security is a business intelligence problem Automated measures show the way

Call to Action
Every organization is at a different place in the journey Remember the basics:
1. Document a security program charter 2. Empower stakeholders to govern the program 3. Clearly document their intentions (policies) 4. Establish their priorities for defense 5. Create a plan for quality management 6. Define specific measures / metrics for success 7. Regularly report to key stakeholders / leadership

Operationalizing Security Program Metrics
Next week you should:
­ Download the free resources at cisecurity.org & auditscripts.com ­ Decide which standards will drive your security program
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Create / review your security program charter ­ Evaluate / update your security policy library to reflect your goals
Within six months you should:
­ Choose 5-10 measures to report to senior leadership
