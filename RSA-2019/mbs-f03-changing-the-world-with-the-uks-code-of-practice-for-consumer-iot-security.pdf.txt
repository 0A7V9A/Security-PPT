Secure by Design
UK National Cyber Security Strategy:
"the UK is more secure as a result of technology, products and services having cyber security designed into them by default"

#RSAC
Review
Primarily address two key risks related to consumer IoT:
­ Poorly secured IoT devices and associated services increasingly threaten consumers' online security, privacy and even safety.
­ Poorly secured devices are likely to be hijacked and can be used in large-scale DDOS attacks (e.g. mirai botnet). The impact is felt by third parties rather than the end user.

#RSAC
UK Government Approach
2017 - 2018:
­ Cooperation with industry, academia, consumer associations and international partners
March 2018:
­ Policy report
October 2018:
­ Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security ­ Mapping of the Code to existing
recommendations ­ Consumer guidance

UK Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security
13 outcome-focused, high-level guidelines. Brings together what is widely considered good practice. Focuses on what matters most. Not a silver bullet to all problems. Primary audience: device manufacturers.

standards and recommendations

Analysed 100+ sources from 50+ organisations
Mapping for each guideline
­ Guideline 1 - No default passwords: 39 recommendations mapped from 13 organisations
­ Guideline 5 ­ Communicate securely:
144 recommendations mapped from 26 organisations

Pledges to implement the Code of Practice
IoT manufacturers that have made a public commitment to implement the Code of Practice:

#RSAC
Development of an ETSI TS on Consumer IoT Security
ETSI TS 103 645

#RSAC
Consumer Guidance

#RSAC
Labelling
Evidence based research on an IoT label based on priority aspects of the Code and ETSI TS Engaging with international governments and expert working group Reviewing how and where labels are signposted to consumers Further details on labelling scheme in Spring 2019

#RSAC
Apply your knowledge!
Next week you should:
­ Read the Code of Practice and understand where you are in the ecosystem
In the first three months you should:
­ Assess any IoT products you control, manufacture, sell or use ­ Understand who the key stakeholders are ­ e.g. mobile app providers,
device suppliers etc.
Within six months you should:
­ Understand how the security of these IoT products and services maps to existing recommendations and standards
