Conclusion
Silos are death to a multi-cloud strategy ­ a uniform "best-of-breed" security stack is essential Build vs. buy ­ make the best choice you can based upon your needs Automation is key to gathering the right data to make decisions Clear tracking with established escalation paths keeps things moving Connect dashboards to real business results for executives
