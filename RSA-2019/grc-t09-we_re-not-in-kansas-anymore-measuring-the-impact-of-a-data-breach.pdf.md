Apply What You Have Learned Today
How can you use this?
­ How do you measure impact of breach risk in your organization? ­ How are these measurements communicated to management?
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Understand how your organization measures risk of breach ­ Determine which of these indicators apply to your situation ­ Include your findings in your management communications and
evaluate how they can be used to better your security posture.
23

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Within six months you should:
­ Incorporate risk indicators into your IR planning ­ Determine if these indicators change your risk calculations ­ Expand your incident response planning to account for relevant new
risks ­ Incorporate feedback from management about the communications
you are providing and enhance as needed
24

#RSAC
Considerations
These cases take a long time for some of these indicators to surface. Some settlements are not publicized. This dataset is continuing to evolve.
25

#RSAC
Future Research
How to handle unknown number of records Look at international incidents (different legal framework) Refine/bring more rigor to weighting Can we use this to make a predictive model?
