#RSAC
PCI DSS and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Applies wherever payment card data is stored, processed or transmitted
Provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements
Focused on the protection of payment card data
4

Voluntary Framework for managing cybersecurity-related risk
Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices
Promotes the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure

Mapping Relationships

Observations from Mapping Exercises
Both PCI DSS and the NIST CSF provide a comprehensive approach to security
Mapping results are not exact matches
Controls used to meet PCI DSS can contribute to meeting CSF, and vice versa
Meeting either PCI DSS or the CSF does not result in the other being met

#RSAC
Example Mappings ­ Equivalence

NIST CSF (ID.AM-3)
· Organizational communication and data flows are mapped

PCI DSS (Req. 1.1) · Network diagram that identifies all
connections to/from CDE (Req. 1.1.2)
· Diagram that shows all cardholder data flows (Req. 1.1.3)

8

#RSAC
Example Mappings ­ Subset

NIST CSF (PR.DS-7)
· The development and testing environment(s) are separate from the production environment

PCI DSS (Req. 6.4) · Separate development/test
environments from production environments, enforce with access controls (Req. 6.4.1)
· Separation of duties between development/test and production environments (Req. 6.4.2)

9

#RSAC
Example Mappings ­ Intersections

NIST CSF (PR.DS-2) · Data-in-transit is protected

PCI DSS · Use strong cryptography to protect
cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks (Req. 4)
· Use strong cryptography to protect authentication credentials during transmission (Req. 8.2.1)

10

Mapping View
NIST CSF · Integrity checking
mechanisms are used to verify hardware integrity (PR.DS-8)

#RSAC
PCI DSS (Req. 9.9) · Devices that capture
payment card data are protected from tampering and substitution

11

Reverse View
NIST CSF · Integrity checking
mechanisms are used to verify hardware integrity (PR.DS-8)
· Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried (ID.AM-1)
· All users are informed and trained (PR.AT-1)

#RSAC
PCI DSS (Req. 9.9) · Devices that capture
payment card data are protected from tampering and substitution

Example Mappings ­ Not Related
CSF Subcategories
­ Availability
o Adequate capacity to ensure availability is maintained (PR.DS-4)
o Systems operate in pre-defined functional states to achieve availability (PR.PT-5)
­ Recovery communications
o Public relations are managed (RC.CO-1) o Reputation after an event is repaired (RC.CO-2)

#RSAC
The Mapping Process
PCI SSC is the first organization to work with NIST to undertake an exhaustive study on the extent to which another standard fulfills CSF elements
Process requires a thoughtful approach to mapping

#RSAC
Lessons Learned
PCI DSS and NIST CSF both offer comprehensive security coverage Complementary approaches; one does not supersede need for the other NIST mapping shows one-way relationship from the Reference to the CSF Achieving CSF outcomes may not result in payment data being protected

And PCI is Evolving.....

DSS Revision and Future Updates
2018 Revision Next major release

#RSAC
What We've Heard During Open Feedback Period

Objective Based Requirements
BENEFITS
Suited to organizations with mature risk management programs and robust
governance structures Supports adoption of cutting-edge technologies ­ organizations finding new ways to meet their security needs

CHALLENGES
Broader variance between implementations: Greater effort required to validate if security
requirements are met
More open to subjective interpretation when evaluating
level of security assurance

#RSAC
DSS Potential Goals
Design security requirements to include objective/outcomebased assessment Establish culture for on-going security practices Enhance the validation methodology

#RSAC
Security Approach for Different Audiences
Objectivebased Testing
Traditional Security Testing
Tools & Guidance
Breadth and variance of target audience

#RSAC
TIMELINE FOR DSS V4.0 ENGAGEMENT
Expected 2020 Publication with additional RFCs starting in Fall 2019

Opportunity to Provide Feedback on DSS
New RFC Process for 2019: Consistency in approach Transparency in changes RFC Logistics

#RSAC

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned
Evaluate existing critical assets and properly label their priority to your organization Evaluate industry mappings to reduce duplicity of internal assessment Stay connected and informed as these frameworks constantly change to reflect new risk
