#RSAC
Aviation sector benefits from its DNA...

Culture

Mature accountability and risk management
Robust international standards
Pro-active to emerging risks
Timely information sharing

PHYSICAL SECURITY

Dedicated security teams Objective testing and exercising

Safety culture "everyone's responsibility"
Accountability, governance, objectivity
`One in a billion' risk of catastrophic system failure

SAFETY

Risk ­ `ALARP'

Timely information sharing

Dedicated safety teams Objective root cause analysis of incidents

Set by?

Culture
Standards and regulations
Or both?

From cybersecurity regulations

Critical Operators regulations
Applicable to Airports and Air traffic management centers

Passenger Data Privacy associated regulations
Applicable to Airports and Airlines mainly

Conclusions

We are on the cusp of a digital revolution that will
transform the aviation sector

Aviation now looks like any other digitized, connected industry
Much the same technology,
vulnerabilities and adversaries

We must secure stakeholder trust as
well as safety critical systems

We must also learn across sectors
to be safer, faster, together

35

#RSAC
What can other sectors learn from aviation?
Speed of technological development can outstrip your ability to understand, find and fix vulnerabilities
The value of risk culture as well as regulation and compliance
Info sharing and collaboration can be more than a bullet point...
Leadership, accountability and governance are critical...
The strength of an international approach and the risk of regionalisation in a global industry
36

#RSAC
What can the aviation sector learn / do?
The benefits of an open dialogue across all stakeholders about risks and opportunities
Collaborate with other sectors, we have the same challenges, supply chains and potential solutions
Apply the foundations of safety and physical security to the cyber security challenge
Resilient trust is as essential as resilient systems
Secure today's aviation sector but also securely design tomorrows
