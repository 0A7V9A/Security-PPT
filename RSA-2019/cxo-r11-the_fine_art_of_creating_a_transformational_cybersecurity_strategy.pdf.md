Security 101 ­ Do You Have Support?
Do you really have senior management support? Ask yourself: Have they committed to funding the program, or are they on the journey to offer funding?
Do they understand that cybersecurity is a business risk? Is cybersecurity risk on the corporate risk register? Am I empowered by executive sponsors, and do I have direct access to them? Does my governance board represent my whole business, and at a level senior enough to make decisions?

SHOW HOW SECURITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

Security mission -- "security will neither hinder nor halt our business."

Our current issues:
· Low maturity security function as assessed during recent internal audit
· Reactive to incidents rather than proactive
· Inhibits business growth and not seen as a trusted business partner
· Embryonic capabilities in most areas

We will address this by:
· Transforming security function to become a trusted business partner
· Addressing risks highlighted by audit
· Delivering a forwardthinking security function that drives new technology adoption
· Refreshing perimeter controls and enhancing monitoring capability

Enabling the following business benefits:
· 30% decrease in customer complaints related to security
· 20% reduction in security waivers
· Partnership scores of 8/10 on business projects that we support
· Decrease in incidents based on 2015 to 2018 average
