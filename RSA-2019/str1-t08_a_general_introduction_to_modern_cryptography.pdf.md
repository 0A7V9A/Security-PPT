Cryptography Basics on the Internet

Internet Security?
The Internet was not designed for security.
Sending data via the Internet is like sending post cards through the mail ...
...when you don't trust the Post Office.

#RSAC
A Typical Internet Transaction

You (client)

Merchant (server)

I want to make a purchase. What is your Credit Card Number? My Credit Card is 6543 2345 6789 8765.

#RSAC
Basic Encryption
Can we at least protect the credit card number so that it won't be revealed to anyone except the intended merchant?

#RSAC
Kerckhoffs's Principle (1883)
The security of a cryptosystem should depend only on the key.
You should assume that attackers know everything about your system except the key.

#RSAC
Symmetric Encryption
If the client has a pre-existing relationship with the merchant, the two parties may have a shared secret key  ­ known only to these two.
User encrypts private data with key .
Merchant decrypts data with key .

#RSAC
Requirements for a Key
A key should be really, really hard to guess ... Even if you have a lot of time. Even if you have a lot of computational resources. Even if you have a lot of samples that use the key.

#RSAC
PINs, Passwords, & Keys
Informally ... A PIN is a 4-6 digit speed bump. A password is a short, user-chosen, usually guessable selection from a small dictionary. A key is an unguessable, randomly chosen string ­ usually at least 128 bits.

#RSAC
On-Line Defenses
On-line attacks can be mitigated.
Rates can be controlled. Counts can be limited. Real-time monitoring can detect unusual access patterns.

#RSAC
Off-Line Attacks
Encryption keys are subject to off-line attacks. An attacker can search a space of roughly 264 values. ­All PINs of fewer than 20 digits ­All passwords of fewer than 14 lower case letters ­All alphanum passwords of fewer than 12 characters ­All printable passwords of fewer than 10 characters

#RSAC
Off-Line Attacks
Don't even think about using user-chosen passwords as encryption keys.
Don't even think about using keys derived deterministically from user-chosen passwords.
Given the ciphertext, an attacker can do a (guided) exhaustive search through the space to find the password.

#RSAC
Modern Symmetric Ciphers
Private-key (symmetric) ciphers are usually divided into two classes.
Stream ciphers
Block ciphers

#RSAC
Stream Ciphers
RC4, A5/1, SEAL, SPRITZ, etc.
Use the key as a seed to a pseudo-random number-generator (PRNG). Take the stream of output bits from the PRNG and XOR it with the plaintext to form the ciphertext.

#RSAC
The XOR Function

0 1 001 110

Each of the two input bits indicates whether or not the other bit is flipped.

#RSAC
Some Good Properties
Stream ciphers are typically very fast.
Stream ciphers can be very simple.
The same function is used for encryption and decryption.

#RSAC
Stream Cipher Insecurity
If two plaintexts are ever encrypted with the same key stream
1 =   1 2 =   2
an attacker can easily compute
1  2 = 1  2 from which 1 and 2 can usually be teased apart easily.

#RSAC
SSL/PCT/TLS Secure Channel
Once the negotiation is complete, all subsequent secure messages are sent encrypted ­ using the negotiated session key, and integrity checked with a keyed "message authentication code".

#RSAC
Hybrid Cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography has many useful features not available in traditional symmetric cryptography.
Symmetric cryptography is much more efficient than asymmetric.
The practical hybrid is formed by using asymmetric cryptography to establish a secure channel and symmetric cryptography within the secure channel.

#RSAC
SSL/PCT/TLS Agility
A principal reason for the success of SSL/TLS is its agility.
The handshake negotiates symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, the hash function, and even the protocol's own version. This has allowed the protocol to survive and expand while many underlying primitives have been discredited or lost favor.

#RSAC
Forward Secrecy
If RSA is used to encrypt symmetric keys, then if your RSA key is ever compromised, an eavesdropper who has been quietly collecting your encrypted messages can suddenly "go back in time" and decrypt all of your prior traffic.
If instead, a new Diffie-Hellman key is exchanged with each new transmission and destroyed when the transmission is complete, attacks must be active and real-time and cannot decrypt prior traffic.

#RSAC
Wikipedia
"In mathematics, an elliptic curve (EC) is a smooth, projective algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point O. An elliptic curve is in fact an abelian variety ­ that is, it has a multiplication defined algebraically, with respect to which it is a (necessarily commutative) group ­ and O serves as the identity element. Often the curve itself, without O specified, is called an elliptic curve."

Why use Elliptic Curves?
The best currently known algorithm for EC discrete logarithms would take about as long to find a 160-bit EC discrete log as the best currently known algorithm for integer discrete logarithms would take to find a 1024-bit discrete log. Currently, 256-bit EC discrete logs take about as long as 3072-bit integer discrete logs.
256-bit EC algorithms are faster and use much shorter keys than 2048-bit "traditional" algorithms.

#RSAC
Why not use Elliptic Curves?
EC discrete logarithms have been studied far less than integer discrete logarithms.
There's no fundamental reason why a sub-exponential algorithm for EC discrete logarithms couldn't be found.
Basic EC operations are more cumbersome than integer operations, so EC is only faster if the keys are much smaller.
Getting the best performance from elliptic curves requires use of special curves.
EC Cryptography requires the use of "sophisticated" pre-agreed curves.

#RSAC
Quantum Computing

#RSAC
What is a Quantum Computer?
A quantum computer operates on quantum mechanical qubits instead of ordinary binary bits. An ordinary bit is either a 0 or a 1. A qubit can hold the superposition of many ordinary bits.

#RSAC
What can a Quantum Computer Do?
Quantum computers can do two things better than ordinary computers.
1. Grover's Algorithm: Fast exhaustive search
 objects can be searched in  time.
2. Shor's Algorithm: Fast integer factorization
An -bit integer can be factored in () time. (The same is true for discrete logarithms.)

#RSAC
Decoherence
Keeping qubits stable is very, very hard. The standard trick is to use error correction ­ lots of error correction. But this requires more qubits. It can take tens of thousands of physical qubits to from a single logical qubit.

#RSAC
Post-Quantum Cryptography
What would cryptographers do in the face of a large quantum computer?
Quantum cryptography is not the answer to quantum computation.
The remedy is quantum-resistant (or postquantum) cryptography.

#RSAC
Post-Quantum (PQ) Cryptography
Symmetric Ciphers Grover's algorithm enables searching through  objects in  time. A classic attack on a good 128-bit cipher requires  2128 time. A quantum attack can reduce this to  264 time. Solution: Use 256-bit ciphers.

#RSAC
Post-Quantum (PQ) Cryptography
Asymmetric Ciphers
Shor's algorithm hits RSA, Diffie-Hellman and related asymmetric ciphers much harder.
Quantum-resistant alternatives generally require much larger keys, much larger ciphertexts and signatures, or both.

3 Definitions of One-Way Hashes
1. Non-invertible: Given a target output, it's hard to find an input that produces the target output.
2. 2nd pre-image resistant: Given an input, it's hard to find another input that produces the same output.
3. Collision-intractable: It's hard to find any two inputs that produce the same output.

Write and use their own election verifiers. Download applications from sources of their choice to verify the mathematical proof of the tally. Believe verifications done by their political parties, LWV, ACLU, etc. Accept the results without question.

The "Great" Rift
There is a long-standing dispute amongst election advocates.
Most security experts say that paper ballots are necessary for good election security.
Accessibility advocates say that paper is a nonstarter for voters with visual or motor skill needs.

#RSAC
The "Great" Compromise
In a 2017 meeting at the headquarters of the Election Assistance Commission in Silver Springs, it was agreed that compliant voting systems must either 1. be paper-based, or 2. be end-to-end verifiable. (Note that a voting system can be both.)

What's Next?
Internet Voting? Some jurisdictions are beginning to explore Internet voting. There is a strong push towards IV from a variety of constituencies.

#RSAC

#RSAC
U.S. Vote Foundation E2E-VIV
Principal Conclusions
1. Any public elections conducted over the Internet must be endto-end verifiable.
2. No Internet voting system of any kind should be used for public elections before end-to-end verifiable in-person voting systems have been widely deployed and experience has been gained from their use.
