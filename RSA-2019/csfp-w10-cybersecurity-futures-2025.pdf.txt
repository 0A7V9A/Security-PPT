#RSAC
WHAT: Key Propositions for the Project
Cybersecurity, broadly defined, is the master problem of the Internet era The problem set is evolving more quickly than is our understanding of it (and certainly our ability to `solve')
Different countries and societies will grapple with the challenges those two propositions present, in different ways
Gaining foresight into those differences now will better situate us to tilt the digital world in a direction that is more secure and beneficial to people and societies...

#RSAC
WHY: Bridging the Gap

between policy,

between short

research and strategy term and long term

between people and technology

6

#RSAC
HOW: Using Scenarios

Simplify

Exaggerate

Add Complexity

And now...Moving away from the official future...

New Wiggle Room
Perfect information makes societies perfectly miserable ­ and the escape is
multiple identities.

Quantum Leap
Quantum capabilities are available to some, and containing `proliferation' is not
a simple matter of carrots and sticks.

Barlow's Revenge
In the digital world, the state is now either fully in or fully out ­ and not all countries make the `obvious' choice

Trust Us
The stakes of deciding between an unsafe-yet-open internet and a safe but closed and surveilled SafetyNet are clear,
but not what we expected.

Part II: March Madness
A whole new take on bracketology

#RSAC
Today's activity

Step 1: Work through the left side of the bracket
(most likely, most positive outcomes)

Step 2. Decide on your pick

Step 3: Use the live polling application to
register your pick

Rinse and Repeat for the most worrisome negative byproduct

16

#RSAC
Polling results and discussion

Q 1 results

Are these results surprising?

Q 2 results

How do we address the most worrisome byproduct?

How do we foster the environment for the most positive byproduct?

Part III: Preliminary findings

#RSAC
Overarching Observations
A nationalized discussion Disillusionment with cyber norms Keeping hold of the upside
19

#RSAC
Re-Framing the Landscape
1. The `golden mean' of light-touch regulation and permission-less innovation will not endure, because it is not an effective route to improved digital security
2. Digital geopolitics is not simply another layer on conventional geopolitics. Alliances, trade relationships, and wars may be re-configured around digital as a primary driver.
3. Digitally-induced job displacement and inequality is more than a stressor. It is set to be a driver of fundamental breakdown in markets and states, and could be a primary cause of transnational realignments.
4. Platform firms are different. They can't continue to free-ride on social order, and not just because of market power. It's also an issue of managing truth and discourse. Competition policy and cybersecurity policy are converging.
5. The greatest security challenges are not about protecting networks and data from (sovereign and criminal) thieves. It is about protection from manipulation -- the maintenance of data integrity and trust.

Part IV: Applications of today's presentation

#RSAC
How to apply Cybersecurity 2025: When you leave today
Go into the website (www.cyberfutures2025.org), watch the bonus video and engage with the tool
­ Provides us with data ­ Provides you with some time to think strategically
Read the report Encourage your colleagues in other sessions to go to the website and engage with the tool
­ The more data the better!
22

#RSAC
How to apply Cybersecurity 2025: In the next 3 months
Hold a futures session with your leadership Show them the videos (www.cyberfutures2025.org) and present the report findings Provide the short report we will generate with the data that comes from this session (helps set priorities) Engage in discussion aimed at:
­ Preventing those outcomes that are most detrimental to your business ­ Investing in those outcomes that provide the best environment within
which your business can succeed
