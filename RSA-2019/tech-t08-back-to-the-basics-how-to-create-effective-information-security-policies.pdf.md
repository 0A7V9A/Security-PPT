#RSAC
What's worse?*
having a poorly executed policy that no one follows -or-
having no policy at all?
*with credit to the CISO Security Vendor Relationship Series Podcast (https://cisoseries.com/)

#RSAC
What's worse?
being granted permission to publish whatever policy you want -or-
having to explain and justify the policies you want to implement

The Foundation for Good Policies

#RSAC
Why do policies fail?
C-Suite doesn't buy-in The "why" isn't understood Too complex Lack of monitoring and enforcement Re-using someone else's policy Creating audit fodder

First... what are the differences between policies,

standards, procedures, and guidelines?

Purpose

Policy

Defines management intent for addressing risk; provide support for other controls

Standards Provides technical details to support policy implementation

Procedures Step-by-step directions for implementing one or more aspects of a policy

Guidelines User-focused tips that support the objectives of a policy

#RSAC
Foundations for a good policy
Setting a clear tone from the top Gaining broad-based input and support Focusing on adding value, not just checking a box Aligning with the enterprise risk appetite Aligning with the business
9

#RSAC
Elements of policy alignment
Regulations Frameworks Business engagement Governance Leadership
10

#RSAC
Alignment with regulations and frameworks
Understand the regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, PCI) that apply
­ Identify areas of risk to address ­ Provide boundary conditions where risk may/may not be acceptable
Leverage frameworks (e.g. NIST, ISO) to guide the process
­ Provides best practices for creating controls ­ Meet multiple regulatory requirements with a single set of controls ­ Caution: not usually easy to use! Need to put in context of the business ­ May need a hybrid of multiple frameworks
11

#RSAC
Business alignment: input from stakeholders and SMEs

Stakeholders
Board C-Suite Compliance/Audit Engineering/Operations Customer-facing functions GenOps functions Customers

Subject Matter Experts
Peer organizations (e.g. ISACs) Professional groups (e.g. ISC^2) Consultants (e.g. benchmarking) Informal networking with peers
12

#RSAC
Business alignment: requirements and constraints

Requirements Regulatory Legal Contractual Business plans

Constraints Financial Operational Technology People

#RSAC
The importance of governance
Use a governance committee for stakeholder input and buy-in ­ Include representatives from all key stakeholder groups ­ Right-size the group ­ Have a regular meeting cadence ­ Include agenda time for handling exceptions ­ Maintain transparency
14

#RSAC
Leadership: the CISO's role in policy making
The CISO should:
­ Understand and be part of the business ­ Help the business balance risk vs. value ­ Educate the business on information security risks ­ Calibrate the organization's moral compass on data privacy ­ Act as a "choice architect" for leadership ­ Understand that there will be differences of opinion on risk vs. value ­ Not be afraid to take a stand against egregious or negligent behavior
15

#RSAC
Leadership: the CISO's role in policy making
The CISO should not:
­ Not behave as if above the business ­ Expect to win every battle ­ Always take a hard line and refuse to budge... you will be marginalized
16

Writing Effective Policies

#RSAC
The keys to writing effective policies
Readability Structure Maintainability SMART Content

#RSAC
Readability
Write with the audience in mind Don't go overboard with legalese Keep policies to a manageable length Remember: if the policy can't be easily understood, it probably won't be followed!
19

#RSAC
Policy structure
Use consistent structure to enhance policy readability; example: ­ Scope ­ Purpose ­ Policy statements ­ Roles and responsibilities ­ Exceptions ­ Revision history ­ Approvals ­ Definitions ­ Cross-references to regulatory and/or framework requirements
20

#RSAC
Maintainability: consider using a glossary
Need to keep terminology definitions consistent This is challenging when terms are repeated across policies Defining commonly used terms in a glossary improves manageability
21

#RSAC
SMART policies
Specific: the policy addresses specific, clearly defined issues Measurable: there is a means to measure the effectiveness of the policy Achievable: the policy can be implemented in a reasonable manner Relevant: the policy addresses the needs and risks of the business Timely: the time required to implement the policy is appropriate

#RSAC
1. Develop
Summarizing key points from earlier discussion:
­ Align with and seek input from stakeholders ­ Ensure readability and enforceability (e.g. with SMART principles) ­ Use governance processes to review and ratify

#RSAC
2. Announce
Avoid surprises! Develop a communications plan
­ What will be happening (including any accompanying technical controls) ­ Why is it happening ­ Who is affected ­ When it will be happening ­ Where more information can be found
Use multiple channels to communicate
27

#RSAC
3. Publish
Use a central repository for storing and publishing policies
­ Usually on the intranet, but may be Internet-accessible ­ Must be available to all who must abide by the policy ­ GRC systems (e.g. Archer) can help
Maintain a revision history
­ Follow best practices for change management ­ May be needed to support post-breach regulatory investigations
28

#RSAC
4. Educate
Policies won't/can't be followed if they're not understood! The level of required understanding may differ Plans for education before rolling out the policy Track completion and effectiveness of education activities
29

#RSAC
5. Monitor & Enforce
Goals, metrics, KPIs, and targets should be used to monitor and manage progress, e.g.:
­ Goal: require the use of MFA by a certain date ­ Metric: number of users enrolled in MFA ­ KPI: % of users enrolled in MFA (is going up or down?) ­ Targets: 50% enrolled by X, 75% enrolled by Y, 100% enrolled by Z
30

#RSAC
5. Monitor & Enforce
Policies should also include enforcement mechanisms Define roles and responsibilities for enforcement
­ Consider using RACI chart
Have a mechanism to consider and approve exceptions
­ Must be done at an appropriate level in the organization
Define penalties for failure to comply
­ Tie to HR processes
31

#RSAC
6. Feedback
Continuous improvement is a must Learn from incidents Business requirements and constraints evolve Regulations change Rule of thumb: review all policies on a 1 to 3 year cycle
32

Wrap-up

#RSAC
Summary
Policies usually succeed or fail based on the "tone from the top" Policies should underlie all other security controls Ensure policies are aligned with the business Write policies in a way that they can be understood and followed Regularly review and update policies Have reasonable consequences for non-compliance Effectively communicating policies is key to adoption
34

#RSAC
Apply
Within the next month
­ Review current policies and note those that are out of date
Within the next quarter
­ Map policies back to your compliance requirements and note any gaps ­ If you don't already have one, start a governance committee
Within the next six months
­ Begin addressing identified gaps with new or revised policies
