TODAY'S CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE
Current cybersecurity training and education solutions are fragmented, often geared towards building a pipeline of candidates, and yet rarely relate skills or competencies to actual job roles.

OVER 260 ญญ
Universities teach cyber defense skills

ABOUT 150 ญญ
Universities teach offensive cyber skills

#RSAC
DELL/CYBERVISTA PARTNERSHIP

Dell sought to develop a human capital management plan for the company's current and anticipated cybersecurity staff by:
ท Fully understanding the cybersecurity job roles within its enterprise
ท Obtaining an underlying and comprehensive list of associated foundational and specialized skills mapped to each role

CyberVista sought to create employer-driven training and curriculum that addresses actual skills needed on the job by:
ท Fully understanding the skills needed to successfully perform cybersecurity job functions
ท Identifying career, skill, and training pathways for cyber professionals

ท Creating more accurately represented job families from a Human Capital perspective

ท Creating a detailed taxonomy roadmap that identified skill gaps between roles and levels

ท Researching more effective and efficient training and upskilling solutions

ท Developing and investing in more effective and efficient training and upskilling solutions

Dell Workforce Analysis

#RSAC
Challenges
What challenges did we face? ท All leaders believe their job is distinctly different ท Tight job family structure within Dell ท Hiring ramp running concurrently with job family changes ท Alignment to approved salary survey vendors ท Lack of existing market trends

#RSAC
Research Process
Building upon research done by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and leveraging the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF), we were able to understand the market taxonomy and discrete skills needed by Dell for job roles at multiple levels and create a roadmap that ties role requirements and skills together.
This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of our roles prior to market alignment.
The NCWF was also provided to our internal stakeholders and external consultant to ensure we were speaking the same language.

Approach

1. Job Inventory

ท Reviewed 400 + existing team members' roles ท Identified what jobs we were planning for in our 150 + open requisitions

2. Job Analysis

ท Conducted a thorough job analysis of all existing roles and open reqs through internal stakeholder interviews (50 + hours) with an external Radford consultant present
ท Identified role responsibilities and skills required of the team member

#RSAC

ท Discussed future state of the organization and skills needed with leadership team ท Evaluated market landscape and trends, created internal job hierarchy with future in mind 3. Future State Needs
ท Hosted multiple alignment sessions with external partners and consultant 4. Internal & ท Connected with internal Market Intelligence group and stakeholders
External Alignment

What Next?
Continue to move our Dell security organization towards professionalization ท Monitor the market for emerging trends and continue to refine our job family structure ท Establish a training plan and identify skills gaps ท Create a diverse pipeline of security professionals

CyberVista Training Development

#RSAC
Research Process
Through working with Dell to map the skills required in current and future cybersecurity roles, we were able to identify discrete skills needed by Dell for job roles at multiple levels and create a roadmap that ties role requirements and skills together.
We distilled and mapped the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's) outlined for each specialty area in the NCWF to define domains of skill knowledge that would be useable and consumable as training in a corporate environment.

#RSAC
Approach to Address Training
ท Created cyber workforce skill overview for each job family, divided by role, level, and track 1. Job Skill ท Validated common job families and roles again known skill requirements Analysis

ท Identified critical areas of skill gaps between level and various roles
2. Skill Gap ท Created visual roadmap to show career/job role pathway options and associated skills Analysis

3. Training Paths

ท Used this knowledge to define a common/generic core of domains across security ท Developed a detailed learning taxonomy that maps skills to roles, ensuring mapped to NCWF

4. Training Content

ท Created lexicon to differentiate levels and proficiencies ท Identified specific topics covered in each domain to target curriculum development

Skill Gap Analysis

#RSAC
Based on the NIST Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
By analyzing the frequency of the requested skills we were able to group them into subsets and identify skills gap between roles

Creating Career Pathways

#RSAC
Combining the defined skills with a detailed understanding of Dell's job roles, we were able to create and visualize career pathways that identify the skill gaps between different roles and their corresponding levels.

#RSAC
Training Pathways
