The Shifting IT Environment
(...or why security has become so important)

#RSAC
Shift: Compliance and Consequences
The business has to adhere to regulations, guidelines, standards,...
­ We are in a period of rapidly expanding legislation: privacy, data sovereignty, due care, PII/PHI protection, breach notification, ...
­ GDPR, HIPAA, GLBA, ..., many more
Audits have changed the economics of risk and create an "impending event"
Hackers may attack you but auditors will show up
Disclosure laws mean that the consequences of failure have increased
­ Waves of disclosure legislation

#RSAC
Shift: Technology
· The majority of applications/transactions now operate over the web · Most of the technology infrastructure the enterpriser operates on is not
controlled by the enterprise · Cloud has changed our notion of a perimeter · Worker mobility is redefining the IT landscape · Shadow IT is becoming enterprise IT · Vast majority of web transactions are now encrypted (SSL) · The security model has changed from good people vs. bad people to
enabling partial trust
­ There are more "levels" of access: Extranets, partner access, customer access, identity management, ...

#RSAC
Shift: Attackers
Many cyber criminals are organized and profit-driven
An entire underground economy exists to support cybercrime
Attackers are shifting their methods to exploit both technical and human weaknesses
Attackers after much more than traditional monetizable data (PII, etc.)
State-sponsored attacks Influence Hacktivism IP attacks/breaches

#RSAC
Shift: Customer expectations
Customers, especially businesses, are using security as a key discriminator
Security has become a non-negotiable expectation of businesses
Security is being woven into service level agreements (SLAs)
The "average person" is now familiar with security

#RSAC
Big Questions
How do you communicate the value of security to the enterprise (and management)? How do you measure security? How do you rank risks? How do you reconcile security and compliance? How do you adapt to paradigms like IoT? How can you be proactive and not reactive? What is "threat intelligence" and how would you actually consume, act on or share it? What changes are likely in privacy laws, data sovereignty, trust? What about big issues in the news like breaches of very personal data that cannot be reset or revoked? How should/can we adapt what we do based on them?

The Economics of Security

#RSAC
Hackernomics (noun)
A social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of attacker motivations, economics, and business risk. Characterized by 5 fundamental immutable laws and 4 corollaries

#RSAC
Law 1
Most attackers aren't evil or insane; they just want something
Corollary 1.a.: We don't have the budget to protect against evil people but we can protect
against people that will look for weaker targets

#RSAC
Law 2
Security isn't about security. It's about mitigating risk at some cost.
Corollary 2.a.: In the absence of metrics, we tend to over focus on risks that are either
familiar or recent.

#RSAC
Law 3
Most costly breaches come from simple failures, not from attacker ingenuity
Corollary 3.a.: Bad guys can, however, be VERY creative if properly incentivized.

#RSAC
The CAPTCHA Dilemma
Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

#RSAC
Law 4
In the absence of security education or experience, people (employees, users, customers, ...) naturally
make poor security decisions with technology
Corollary 4.a.: Systems needs to be easy to use securely and difficult to use insecurely

#RSAC

#RSAC
Law 5
Attackers usually don't get in by cracking some impenetrable security control, they look for weak points like trusting employees
