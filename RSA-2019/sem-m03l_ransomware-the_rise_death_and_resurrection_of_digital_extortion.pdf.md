"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"

· Back-up! Back-up! Back-up! · Use robust Endpoint security software · Network segmenting · Robust identity management · Keep all the software on your computer up to date · Show file extensions · Consider setting up a software restriction Policy (SRP)

Mitigation Tips

#RSAC

· Don't turn off or reboot the computer · Disconnect it immediately from the internet or other network connections,
when infected · Create a memory dump · DO NOT delete any files (inc. Ransom notes) · Take pictures for evidence · Make copy of the encrypted drive · Try to recover files with forensic tools like PhotoRec
· Don't pay, but check NoMoreRansom.org for a possible decryptor · If you decide to pay except the risk of losing everything
and seek professional advice
