Why NIST?
Long track record of successfully, collaboratively working with public and private sectors Experience developing the Cybersecurity Framework Extensive privacy expertise
4

#RSAC
Why a privacy framework?
Designing, operating, or using technologies in ways that are mindful of diverse privacy needs in an increasingly connected and complex environment Multiplying visions for how to address privacy challenges inside and outside the U.S. Good cybersecurity doesn't solve it all

NIST Privacy Framework: Review of Outline and RFI Analysis

#RSAC
Privacy Risk Management
Information Security and Privacy Relationship

Security Risks
arise from unauthorized
system behavior

Security of PII

Privacy Risks
arise as a byproduct of authorized PII processing

· There is a clear recognition that security of PII plays an important role in the protection of privacy
· Individual privacy cannot be achieved solely by securing PII
· Authorized processing: system operations that handle PII (collection ­ disposal) to enable the system to achieve mission/business objectives

Alignment with the Cybersecurity Framework: Tiers

Tiers 1-4:
1. PARTIAL

2. RISK-INFORMED 3. REPEATABLE

4. ADAPTIVE

Elements per tier:
Risk Management Process Informal, ad hoc privacy risk management processes à processes that enable continuous adaptation to changing technologies and data processing activities and incorporate the use of advanced privacy-enhancing technologies
Integrated Risk Management Program A limited awareness of privacy risk at the organizational level à all levels of the organization being able to make decisions with a clear understanding of the relationship between privacy risk organizational objectives
Ecosystem Relationships Entity does not understand its role in the larger ecosystem with respect to other entities à the entity understands its role in the larger ecosystem and contributes to the community's broader understanding and management of privacy risks
Workforce A workforce that has little or no understanding of privacy risks à a workforce that includes specialized privacy skillsets throughout the organizational structure
