#RSAC
· How secure are we? · What is our information security posture
today compared to last quarter? · Do we need to invest more in our current
capabilities and people?
· How effective are our controls? · What are our threats and high risk areas? · Are we protecting the most valuable assets? · What is the level of compliance to our
security policies?
· Where should we allocate our resources to address high risk areas?
· Are we meeting our SLA's in addressing incidents and patching?

Objectives of the ISMP
The Implementation of an Information Security Metrics Program (ISMP) allows the organization to:
Effectively communicate security posture Demonstrate the value of the security investment Drive performance improvement Help prioritize decision making Manage risk and compliance Provide quantitative measurements

#RSAC
The ISMP Framework
The stakeholder questions can be answered through an ISMP framework below:

Governance & On-going Maintenance

Case Study

Challenges we faced

Lessons learnt

Defining appropriate KRIs/KPIs

Answer Management questions

Collecting data from different source Setup a process to receive data from

systems manually

data owners on a monthly basis

Defining recommended actions and get buy-in from data owners to act on

Presenting dashboards with risk level to the management & business sponsors

Discrepancy between asset inventory fields and collected information from data owners

Work with data owners to update the asset inventory

18

Measure Security Posture Using NIST CSF

Adopt and customize NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

Define KRIs, thresholds, reporting frequency.

#RSAC

Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities. The activities in the Identify Function are foundational for effective use of the Framework. Understanding the business context, the resources that support critical functions, and the related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to focus and prioritize its efforts, consistent with its risk management strategy and business needs.
