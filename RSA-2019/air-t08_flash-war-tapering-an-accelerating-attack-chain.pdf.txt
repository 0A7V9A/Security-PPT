THE ACCELERATED ATTACK CHAIN
Automation & Swarm Decrease TTB (Time to Breach)

1 PLANNING

· Research target · Build or Acquire Tools · Test tools + detection

· Identify and collect sensitive data
· Staging Server

2 BREAK-IN

· Deliver remote exploits and malware
· Establish backdoors for commands

· Data exfiltration through

· Move laterally to increase system access
· Stronger Foothold

6 SURVIVE... Or PROFIT?

AUTOSPLOIT ­ BUILDING SWARMS
 Shodan is a search engine that indexes open ports and services  Attacker Queries Shodan  Attacker uses a list of known exploits to attack known IoT and other
systems based on indexed queries given by Shodan  Attackers then attacks IoT or vulnerable systems directly bypassing
per miter security features gaining a foothold into internal networks.

1986: CRAIG REYNOLDS CREATES BOIDS AI SIM
 Worked on Disney's 1982 Tron scene programming  Artificial Life Simulation Program (1986)  Program follows three simple rules
· Collision Avoidance · Velocity Matching · Flock Centering Rules  Used in computer modeling for video games, eg. 1998 Half-Life flying birds  2014: Algorithm adopted for autonomous deployment of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) · Aims for collision free, autonomous surveillance system

 Shortest Path Between Nest and Food  Traveling Salesman Problem  Nodes lay synthetic pheromones along
edges of their paths  History
· 1959: Stigmergy theory invented, behavior of nest building in termites
· 1989: Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is born · Food behavior model implemented
· 1994: British Telecommunications Plc publishes first application of ACO to telecommunication networks
 Applications include emergency vehicle response systems, planning & logistics, microchip manufacturing

Strategic, Agile & Scalable Approaches
Viable Solutions to a Growing Problem

#RSAC
Prediction: Advanced Deception Tactics
Integrating deception techniques into security strategies that introduce network variations built around false information will force attackers to continually validate their threat intelligence, expend time and resources to detect false positives, and ensure that the networked resources they can see are actually legitimate.

#RSAC
Deception Based Approach

DISCOVER

DECOYS

DEPLOY

DETECT

DEFUSE

 Automatically discover network and assets
 Config. monitoring IPs

 Build decoy profiles
 Real OS and services indistinguishable from real assets

 Automatically places decoys in the monitored networks
 Install tokens (breadcrumbs) in real assets

 Real-time alerts from decoy access
 Analyze and correlate of threat activities

 Automatically quarantine or block attacks

Key Takeaways

Humans need to be repurposed not replaced
­ Think about existing cycles that can be replaced with simple automation & orchestration
Deception can be simple
­ Start with deployment of decoy systems within network
Strengthen your kill chain, taper the attacker
­ Run automated red tests and evaluate time to breach window ­ Refactor and repeat tests, attempt to increase window
