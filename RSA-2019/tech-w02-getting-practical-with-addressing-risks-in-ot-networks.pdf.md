(aka "thank you, IT-OT Asymmetry")

1. What you're learned in ITSEC will not serve our mission in securing OT networks
2. We don't have time to close the gap step-by-step, we have to leap-frog

Where Do We Even Start?

#RSAC
Get Management On-Board

90% it's already a boardroom issue

F500 Companies already have an OT strategy

For most, OT is a
Top 5 priority

All started with an assessment: how big is the OT gap?

Lessons Learned

#RSAC
Case Study #1

Case Study #1

#RSAC
 Highly sophisticated ITSEC teams, initially wanted to create a separate OT SOC
 Conclusion reached: Impractical and not cost-effective across tech stack, people, process
 Invest in best practices that leverage existing infrastructure
 Leverage technology to "translate" niche domains

#RSAC
Use What You Already Have
Use What You Already Have
Lesson Learned #1

#RSAC
Case Study #2

Case Study #2

#RSAC
 Connectivity is needed and when not provided, people get creative
 OT network was a black box ­ no way to identify lateral movement
 No visibility into potential attack vectors  No way to identify abnormal process-
related behavior from the network

#RSAC
Visibility First. It's the Investment with the Highest RoI
Lesson Learned #2

#RSAC
Case Study #3

Case Study #3

#RSAC
 Large manufacturing operation, initiated a physical segmentation project (Level 2 and below)
 Impractical to achieve ­ cost, downtime, personnel
 Virtual zones provide what's needed (alert, not block) without the downtime
 Enforcement policy implemented at a higher level
 Doesn't apply to every industry segment

#RSAC
Divide and Conquer Physical segmentation is not always practical Use Virtual Segmentation
Lesson Learned #3

#RSAC
Case Study #4

Case Study #4

#RSAC
 Known case of Triton, lessons apply to any critical infrastructure network
 Attackers in the network for months; ICS network a black box, no ability to identify movement
 Changing programing of Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is a different category of alert
 Measure everything through lenses of potential impact ­ that will inform prioritization

#RSAC
Prioritize Based on Risk Understand the real risk based on OT-Specific Threat Monitoring
Lesson Learned #4

Ultimately, It's All About Investing Smart

Virtual OT Network Segmentation

Full OT Network Visibility

Real-Time Threat Monitoring

#RSAC
In Summary
Best Visibility Yields Better Security:  See and monitor nested devices that others cannot see  Expedite alert triage with OT-related details for improved risk-based decisions  Efficiently respond to threats with OT-specific context your existing SOC team can understand and act on  Pinpoint the vulnerable devices in your OT network by identifying firmware versions, model
Ability to Detect Targeted OT Attacks  Detect attacks Triton-style (0-Day) ­ without requiring signatures  The only way to efficiently detect manipulation of data is by automatically monitoring which device allows altering specific tags
Ability to Prevent Attacks  Eliminate a key OT attack vector ­ unmanaged remote access by employees and contractors  Vitally segment OT network for early detection of likely malicious task  Enable network segmentation - understand your current segmentation, assess weak points, and building mitigation plan
Improved TCO  Integrated platform and integration with your technology stack reduces deployment and operational costs  Capabilities that have no impact on existing headcount, process, and technology

"Apply" Slide ­ What you can do immediately

Establish clear ownership
Communicate who owns OT network security Budget allocations and project timelines

Assess the current status
Understand the true extent of the exposure
Discover the blind spots and quantify the implications

#RSAC
"Apply" Slide ­ What you can do in the next 6-9 months
Goal is to optimize Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) ­ Leverage existing technology stack ­ Plug and play with existing processes ­ Min impact on teams/habits
Transform Opacity into Transparency ­ Leverage all available methods to get to 100% visibility: passive monitoring, active querying, config files
dissection, etc.
Enable network segmentation - understand your current segmentation, assess weak points, and building mitigation plan ­ Implement virtual segmentation for lower levels of the OT network ­ Leverage implementations with existing network infrastructure to implement policy and alert-based
segmentation
Deploy threat detection technology ­ Contextual OT-specific tech with the ability to detect the full spectrum of OT-relevant threats
