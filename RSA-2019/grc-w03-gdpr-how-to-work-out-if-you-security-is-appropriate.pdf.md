"One line alone did it; as for the rest, they relied upon their crews, so far as they can be said to have relied at all.
An adequate receiving set suitable for a coastwise tug
can now be got at small cost and is
reasonably reliable if kept up; obviously it is a source of great protection to their tows."
Judge Learned Hand
@withoutfire

#RSAC
"But here there was no custom at all as to receiving sets; some had them, some did not; the most that can be
urged is that they had not yet become general. Certainly in such a case we need not pause; when some have thought a device necessary, at least we may say that they were right, and the others too slack."

B2. Identity & Access Controls
You understand, document and manage access to personal data and systems that process this data. Access rights granted to specific users must be understood, limited to those users who reasonably need such access to perform their function and removed when no longer needed. You should undertake activities to check or validate that the technical system permissions are consistent with your documented user access rights.
@withoutfire

#RSAC
It is, however, all appropriate
