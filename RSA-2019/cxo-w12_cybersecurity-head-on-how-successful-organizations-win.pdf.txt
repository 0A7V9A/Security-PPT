Privacy and Security Converge
Anticipated regulation and public sentiment on privacy that will drive data
protection policies. For example: GDPR Penalty is 4% of annual revenues or 20
million Euros which ever is greater. Increased focus on data security and privacy legislation translating to strict requirements on the business. Why? Marriott breach impacted 500 million guests & the Yahoo breach impacted 3 billion users The threat of penalties over compromised personal information will have a huge effect on security operations. Facebook lost $119 billion in market capitalization because of privacy concerns related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. U.S. Privacy Law is currently governed on a state by state basis CCPA total penalties for a single event can be up to $250,000 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created in a single day
