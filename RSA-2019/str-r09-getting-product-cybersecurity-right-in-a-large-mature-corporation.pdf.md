Common Questions ...
What are the big challenges? How can I determine what I need (People/ $$s) ? What should I do 1st? 2nd? What standards & practices should I look to? What are best practices for software development lifecycle? Budgeting & Funding techniques that can help with this? What kind of culture do I need to establish?

#RSAC
Biggest challenges for Product Cyber Leaders
Three of the greatest (perennial) challenges with this space: 1) Program ­ Strategy, methods & leadership support 2) Budget ­ Million dollar problem w 100k budget 3) People ­ Org imbalance, freeze, behaviors, recruiting

As you overcome 1,2 & 3... Must stay conscious of cadence for TRACTION

Architects & Assurance Staff to Projects

It's a journey... and it requires skilled people to navigate it

#RSAC
Options to help with Funding
KNOW the needs - start w/ release train owners / Dev managers Grow / Fund by products (Similar to QA or HFE) Use RATIOS! Several models - start w/ what already resonates Blended budget - central budget for Assurance... Archs funded out of BU. Going from 0 to anything is ALWAYS the hardest ...Negotiate
Team sport - Get HR, Legal & Finance to help support your case!

#RSAC
Product Incident Response Team (PSIRT)
If you make software you should have a PSIRT Have a documented & practiced Incident Response plan Many examples: First.org, CERT, ISO & NIST GREAT: First.org PSIRT Framework + CVSS & CWSS scoring
Still see too many companies without a basic IR/PSIRT

#RSAC
Training
Thoughtful & RELEVANT
Not the same as IT Security training (ex. USB Policy) UNDERSTAND your AUDIENCE ­ different msgs needed
­ Executive to Manager ­ Awareness & STEWARDSHIP ­ Developer (intro to adv controls for specific languages) ­ Every Employee ­ Awareness & their role ­ Sales/Service ­ Cyber capabilities of products ­ Supplier ­ Cyber requirements, PSIRT, Responsibilities
Bring in CBT vendor for basic SSDLC + secure coding Audit to Train

#RSAC
Standards & CERTS
In the absence of practices/ Standards use the following: IOT/IIOT = ISA/IEC 62443 , (DRAFT) NIST IOT Baseline Cloud = CSA STAR, SOC 2 Type 2. Product or Process Certifications = ISASecure, UL 29001 People = CSSLP, Ethical Hacker, CCSK, CCSP, CISSP + ISA/IEC 62443 Cybersecurity certificates SSDL = Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle
Use the right tool for the exercise

Methodology agnostic ­ works in Agile & Waterfall

#RSAC
Where the work gets done ...is where the TEAM belongs
Where do the software developers report to? SAME. Product Security is part of Product TCO & ROI (ex. Quality, HFE) Fully integrated & blended with development teams Product Security different from IT Security Collaborate and share (threats/Incidents)
Similar but optimized for different needs... Mixed results when used for cross purposes

#RSAC
GROWING the TEAM
Its not enough to hire, have to grow literacy
High demand specialty ­ Can't win w just $$$ Train to maintain ­ logically and regionally Passionate Few Program + training Fund your team to cyber training & conferences Evolve: part time/dotted line to dedicated/solid line Build into G&Os and raise the bar annually. Certify where it makes sense
This becomes part of the culture YOU build and sustain

#RSAC
Culture
YOU are responsible for the environment
Trust & Collaboration cornerstone of successful teams Arrogance kills collaboration and undermines TRUST Inclusive vs Exclusive Remember why people leave ­ don't be that leader Respect & reward the tech ­ teach the behaviors Share and give away everything (internal)
Give regular training on communication skills and negotiation!

#RSAC
Leadership
Who is your executive champion(s)? Build the story and sell the story to peers and executives KNOW BUSINESS's DATES and be EARLY (Budget, Quarterlies etc) BUILD important relationships with FINANCE, LEGAL, HR and SALES Make sure you and HR on same page (ex. salary, recruiting) Understand your own weaknesses ­ grow and bring in stronger Clarity is more important than perfection

Cyber is a team sport
you need EVERYONE to do their part
Executive Team
Ex. Stewardship, Company msg & posture
Marketing / Comms
Ex. PSIRT, cyber branding Knowledge of cyber value
BD/M&A
Ex. M&A Cyber Assessments

Sales
Ex. Trained in cyber value to customer & Security features in product
Engineering
Ex. Secure development, BUILDS Security & Privacy features Remote upgrade & patch management

#RSAC

Legal
Ex. T&Cs, Regulation Privacy & PSIRT
Supply Chain
Ex. T&Cs, disclosure requirements Secure by design & privacy

Manufacture (incl OEM & ODM)
Ex. PKI, Secure boot
Service
Ex. Secure Installation & Configuration and MAINTAIN... Consult to customer on security
IT
Ex. IP protection, Internal & Employee Privacy.

Having a strong executive champion is a key success factor

Applying What You've Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Assess where you are in relation to what you've learned (Knowledge/$/People) ­ Identify your roadblocks (Program? Budget? Structural?) ­ Identify your key stakeholders/Champions you need to influence
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Self assess (ex. BSIMM) & Identify key areas of improvement ­ What's your "story" to make improvements & correct / overcome roadblocks (ex. Structure) ­ Build/reinforce relationships with your TEAM & Champion(s) ­ INVEST NOW
Within six months you should:
­ Budget defined and BROADLY shared (& bought into) w/ ALL stakeholders ­ Report out to your leadership w CLEAR & SIMPLE plan (ex. MGPP) to enhance your program
