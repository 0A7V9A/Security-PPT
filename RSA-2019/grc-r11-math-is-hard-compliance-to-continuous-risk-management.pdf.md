State of Cyber Risk Management
According to the December 2018 Tenable Measuring & Managing the Cyber Risks to Business Operations study:
Less than half of organizations measure the business costs of cybersecurity risk
Only 38% of organizations believe their measures of business cost of cyber risk to be very accurate

#RSAC
Why Risk Management?
How does your organization identify, monitor, and communicate the value and effectiveness of its cybersecurity program?
How does your organization identify, prioritize, and address top cybersecurity risks?
How does your cybersecurity program gain buy-in to mature from a compliance mindset to a quantitative risk based mindset?

#RSAC
Lord Kelvin
"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science."
"I can state flatly that heavier than air flying machines are impossible."

Goals of Risk Management
Frameworks are moving towards a risk-based approach Customers increasingly want proven security maturity (competitive edge) Reduce waste, prioritize relevant security, and avoid fear mongering Make better, more efficient, and cost-effective decisions

#RSAC
Initial Steps to Ensure Buy-in
Identify Champions Tie to Business Goals/Objectives Have industry-relevant use cases ready
Conduct a proof-of-concept

Common Issues to Avoid
Unproductive Criticism of Current Approach · Focus on ideas that move toward process maturation Failing to Receive Input from Stakeholders · Ensure that the planning process is inclusive Over Promising · Ensure that implementation plan scope is reasonable Failing to Accept Constructive Comments · Be open to different approaches to continuous risk

Implementing Continuous Monitoring

Identify gaps via the assessment process and ongoing monitoring
Identify criteria & implement
­ Select metrics that determine continual effectiveness of controls
­ Evaluate security posture at different levels of the enterprise
Feed effectiveness of controls into risk management and analysis

From Monitoring to Risk Quantification
Using Continuous Monitoring data, we can determine our risk exposure
Once quantified, these risks can be prioritized
Multiple methods of risk analysis - qualitative, semi-quantitative, quantitative
Hybrid approaches can garner more buy-in without a major culture shock

How did you select values?
What if I'm unsure about the likelihood or impact score?
Do we prioritize by expected loss?

Common Questions

Why is there so much uncertainty?

This seems overly complicated. Why would we not do something simple?

Does this mean we have a "yellow" risk?

That number seems off. How can I trust any of this?

Quantitative Example
AVAILABILITY
Assume a 10,000 employee organization has a target uptime of 99.8% for their core network. The average fully-loaded cost/employee is $200/hr and works 2000hrs/year (40hrs/wk x 50wks/yr)
99.8% uptime = network is down for 4 hours/year.
Estimate that between 1,000 and 10,000 employees affected by that 4hr of downtime = $800k to $8mil in lost productivity
If uptime can be increased to 99.9%, then expected productivity loss is halved

Quick Start Guide to Risk Management
Take initial steps to foster buy-in with applicable use-cases and proof-of-concepts During implementation, map applicable policies to identify areas of focus and potential gaps Use manual and automated monitoring of individual policies to measure ongoing effectiveness Create reports at multiple tiers to identify effectiveness at different levels of the enterprise
Feed continuous monitoring data into risk analysis solutions Utilize quantitative risk to prioritize weaknesses and determine appropriate mitigations
