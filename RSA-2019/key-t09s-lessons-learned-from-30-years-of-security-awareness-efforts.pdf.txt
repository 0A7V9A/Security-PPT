#RSAC
Seminal Hasn't Changed Much...Sigh

1995 USENIX UNIX Security Symposium

2018 Social Engineering Webinar

Do not rely upon common internal identifiers
Implement call-back procedure for information disclosure
Implement security awareness program

Be paranoid Train client facing staff Verify identity with other information Implement MFA

Identify direct computer support

Create a security alert system

Perform social engineering to test security

How I Became Cynical, and Maybe an Expert

#RSAC
The Bad Awareness

#RSAC
The Good
There are some really screwed up people there Despite a couple disasters, there are relatively few significant security problems People do accept security procedures when expected to

The Sacred Cow Slaughter House

Social Engineering Doesn't Qualify You as an #RSAC Awareness Expert
I know first hand Social Engineering is easy
­ Amateurs are easily successful
Social engineering can determine unique problems, and possibly the scope Awareness is more than telling people, "Here are problems; Don't fall for that!" Knowing how to break something does NOT mean you know how to fix it
­ It's a completely different science

Corollary: An NLP Course is Not a Substitute #RSAC for Real Human Elicitation Training
Good spies seem to have a 6th Sense
Their lives depend on it
Intelligence operatives have years of training
NLP is good background, but not the same
­ Maybe it's usually enough ­ 90% successful with just the nerve
Give up a password vs Betray country under penalty of torture and death

#RSAC
Yes, You Can Patch Stupid
You better expect users to make mistakes Patching is not getting rid of a problem, but implementing a protection More later, but...
­ You can prevent attacks from getting to the user ­ Taking decisions away from users ­ Proactively mitigating attacks after the fact

#RSAC
You, NOT the Users, Are the Weakest Link
(Behind Every Stupid User is a Stupider Security Professional)
Users are a part of the system you are there to protect
If you can't secure a critical part of the system, it's your fault
Calling the user the weakest link abdicates responsibility
If the user can ruin your network, IT'S YOUR FAULT!

#RSAC
Users Are NOT the First Line of Defense
Grandiose terms about users are as bad as disparaging terms The users are part of the system
­ They are not a resource to the security team
They are not the first line of defense
­ You facilitate the attacks getting to them
They are really not a reliable line of defense

#RSAC
The Human Firewall Sucks
In the first place, technical firewalls fail miserably In the second place, just don't A human firewall is even more unreliable than a real one Users are again not your resource Humans are a part of your system

#RSAC
Yes, You Can Blame the User
Well, as long as the user should know what to do Not following policies and ruining the network/organization should be punished
­ It is literally done with every other business function in an organization ­ Remember the NSA contractors who gave Snowden their passwords
When you have no enforcement, you have no security program

#RSAC
It Is Literally Called Human RESOURCES

#RSAC
Stop. Think. Connect. Just. Don't. Do. It.
STC is a popular campaign Novices vs Skilled Sociopaths It's a losing equation Training people to be on the lookout for the Wascally Wabbit

#RSAC
Gamification Does NOT Mean a Game...

#RSAC
Funny  Effective

#RSAC
Some Examples
You lose your weapon, you will do jail! You lose your badge, you have to pay $100 for a replacement
­ It costs RSAC money ­ It prevents badge duplicate badge use
You don't badge in, you don't get paid You email out PII, you will be called into the office
­ Laws require it now ­ It costs companies money

#RSAC
Sommelier Vs Grandma

#RSAC
Awareness Programs Should All Over People

#RSAC
Likability is NOT a Valid Awareness Metric
Whether or not people like your training is not a valid measure of effectiveness There must be motivation to practice the desired behaviors It doesn't matter if people know why they're doing something It doesn't matter if it's funny They just have to do it
Does it change the behavior?

Why Awareness?

#RSAC
Awareness is a Business Function
Awareness is there to reduce business losses
If it's just a Check the Box, it doesn't matter
­ You might as well do anything
The only thing that matters is that you return more investment than the cost of the awareness program

Security efforts get the budgets they deserve, not the budgets that they need
Learn to deserve more!

Sciences That Don't Seem to Work
The Bro-Science of Awareness

#RSAC
Psychology
I realize it's counterintuitive Psychology is the study of the individual Individuals are mostly different You can't have a different awareness program for every person It helps, but it is too fluffy

#RSAC
Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)
And generally the science of influence Fundamentally, it makes Security behaviors a should Influence is about how to manipulate an individual
­ You are trying to create behaviors, not convincing people to take a specific action at a given time
Can try to incorporate it into awareness Fundamentally Hacking  Security

#RSAC
Mental Models Don't Help
How someone perceives something and makes a decision Some studies indicate Mental Models don't help with security One study showed that the wrong Mental Model can be the best
­ It doesn't matter what they know, it matters what they do
Either way, your goal is to create the behavior no matter how each and every person in the company thinks

A Bit of Science That Works

#RSAC
ABCs of Applied Behavioral Science

Antecedent Behavior
Consequence

Antecedent might create up to 20% of behaviors
Consequences create 80%+ of possible behaviors
Consequences can be positive, negative, or neutral
Positive consequences can reinforce bad behaviors and vice versa

#RSAC
ABCs of Awareness
Awareness creates behaviors Behaviors consistently practiced create culture Culture creates awareness Culture creates behaviors Culture is peer pressure Peer pressure should be the most effective form of awareness training

#RSAC
Gamification
When implemented properly A reward structure for exhibiting desired behaviors For the right environments and roles Tactically for specific behaviors Business drivers tell you what to reward Culture tells you how to reward

#RSAC
Safety Science
Critical financial motivation
­ Injuries cost a lot of money
90% injuries from environment 10% from carelessness or ignorance
­ Assuming they know the appropriate behavior
The last 10% is where awareness comes in

#RSAC
Just About Every Other Business Function
The CFO would be fired for saying people-related losses are too hard to control The COO would be fired for saying that they can't get the employees to do their jobs properly McDonald's automates away just about every employee decision

What Should an Awareness Program Look Like?

#RSAC
It's More than Phishing and CBT
Pervasive You are creating a culture Any communication tool that will work
­ Speakers ­ Newsletters ­ Coffee cup sleeves ­ Anything

#RSAC
The Two Basics
Culture Business Drivers

#RSAC
The Components of an Awareness Program
Topics driven by business drivers Communications tools driven by culture Metrics driven by
­ Business drivers to measure what's important ­ Culture to determine what is easy and available to measure

#RSAC
About Metrics
Should measure the root behavior
­ Not the symptoms ­ Reports of phishing messages ­ Anti-malware reports ­ Calls to the Help Desk ­ Stopping strangers
Should be real business practices

What You Really Need to Do
Create Grandma's House

#RSAC
Culture is the Best Awareness Tool
When everyone does the right thing everyone will do the right thing With or without an awareness program, everyone does what everyone else does

#RSAC
Address Security Like Every Other Business Process
Remove decision making process from users Governance to determine process specifically Technology to implement process
­ Eliminate decisions where possible (passwords, MFA)
Governance defines behavior
­ Specifies how decisions are to be made
Exception handling

#RSAC
Which One Are You Creating?

The Big Question
What Are You Trying To Accomplish?
An Aware User or Mitigating User Related Losses?

#RSAC
Need a Holistic Approach
More at Lab tomorrow Prevent attacks from reaching user
­ Technology and process
User decisions are defined Technology and process take over to mitigate poor user decision

#RSAC
Awareness is Valuable, But...
Generally 1 in 20 users will fail
­ That's 50 people for every 1,000
All it takes is 1 Risk reduction is critical though
­ Is it better to have 5 in 20 fail?

#RSAC
...You Need to Reduce Need for Awareness
Take away need for user action Take away the need to Think. Define decisions Force decisions
