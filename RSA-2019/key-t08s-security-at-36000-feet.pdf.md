Our Philosophy & Approach

Business First
· Get clear on what matters to your company the most, where are the greatest risks?
· Partner with & serve your business
· What are the critical functions that run your business? Think beyond data & protect your operations too.
· Risk is inevitable, we will need to accept some ­ make sure it is conscious, agreed upon and documented

Culture & Brand
· Honesty and transparency ­ talk about security, risk and real threats
· It is our responsibility to educate, advise and inform so the business can make risk based decisions with all the facts
· We must encourage creativity ­ cyber risks are ever evolving, doing things the way we have always done them wont work

Talent & Team
· As leaders we have an obligation to create a team environment that is set for everyone's best success
· Diverse workforce is game changing ­ what does that mean to you?
· How are you preparing for the skills you will need to solve tomorrows problems, not today's?
· Hire for skills, not for titles

Things To Apply to Your Program
· Really understand your ecosystem · Think about operations, not just infrastructure and data · What does your supply chain look like · How does the convergence of physical and cyber affect your business
· Take charge of your culture & brand · Lead with transparency · Serve your business partners · Offer to give cyber briefings anywhere you can ­ evangelize!
· Commit to leading with a diverse mindset ­ our industry needs you to inspire change · Partner with non profits and community colleges · Commit to a diverse slate of candidates when hiring · Lead with heart ­ we're human beings before we're anything!
