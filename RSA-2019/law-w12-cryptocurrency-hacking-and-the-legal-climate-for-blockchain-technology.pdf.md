Regulatory Compliance Where Everything is Written in Ink
California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 includes mandatory opt-out and deletion if requested by a consumer. These cannot be reconciled with Blockchain. European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has similar requirements and the "right to be forgotten". State-by-State Pile-On
­ Vermont - On June 6, 2016, then Governor Peter Shumlin signed into law House Bill 868, which included a section entitled "Blockchain Enabling." This bill made news across the country as Vermont became the first state to legislate the admissibility of blockchain records in court.
­ Arizona and Nevada also took steps toward embracing blockchain records in March and June 2017, respectively, by conferring legally binding status to blockchain records, including smart contracts: "if a law requires a record to be in writing, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the record satisfies the law" (http://lawcast.com/2018/01/02/statedistributed ledger-technology-and-blockchainregulations/).
­ But See: Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, etc.

Apply What You Have Learned Today
First, take a deep breath and hold onto your digital wallets. Understand different blockchain protocols that exist and how they differ. Define situations of hacking and/or financial loss and be able to prevent similar incidents. If launching an ICO, understand key laws in today's financial climate. If implementing blockchain technology, be able to discuss regulatory compliance with product management.
