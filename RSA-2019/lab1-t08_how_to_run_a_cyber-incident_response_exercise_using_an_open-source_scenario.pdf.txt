Why practice?
Get the top team to actively think about this
­ It's not just a theoretical playbook or an IT issue
It's better to make mistakes when the world isn't watching We all learn from mistajes It's very trite but ... Personnel change frequently A control without assurance is not a control

Overcoming objections

We don't have time

Incidents are unknowable

It won't happen to us

We can do this without practice

#RSAC
It takes 2 hours. It can save a fortune.
The general principles are the same. Mostly the questions you need to answer are the same.
You can, and historically people who do this don't do very well.
