The Reality
A destructive incident at one site would require highly-tailored tools and operations and would not effectively scale.
A ransomware infection at the financial services division of an electric utility doesn't automatically translate into a blackout. (IT/OT boundaries)
Six of the ICS-focused activity groups that are tracked have targeted corporate ICS networks for intelligence gathering. Two have gone further.

VPNFilter
In July, SBU reported a chlorine production plant's process control system was infected with VPNFilter malware and could have caused a possible accident had it not been thwarted.
These claims blew up.

VPNFilter
"No known functionality of VPNFilter allows for modification or manipulation of traffic, which would be necessary to weaponize the network device implant."

Supply Chain Concerns
· Third-party or supply chain compromise leverages explicit trust between parties and bypasses a large part of the security stack, potentially including perimeter defenses such as firewalls or proxy servers, to access a target.

Things to Consider
Motivations and consequences
The US response to a cyberattack on the grid

With Each Grid Hacker Media Story, Ask Yourself:

Visibility: Where are they getting the story?

Hype: Is this FUD? Hyperbolic wording vs. explanatory phrases

Legitimacy: Is this a company quoted specializing in ICS security company, or a marketing effort/report?

Evidence: What are their claims based on? What is the specified activity? Has this been reported before?

Political motivations: Reports funded/supported by partisan groups.
