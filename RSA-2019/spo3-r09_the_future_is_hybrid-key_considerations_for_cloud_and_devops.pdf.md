Shifting Left with Containers

Containers Deployed with Unacceptable Risk

Without pre-deployment assessment of images, containers are pushed to production that are vulnerable or contain misconfigurations

Images in Repositories Become Vulnerable

Newly discovered vulnerabilities may make stored images vulnerable without any changes to the images themselves

Production Assessment is Too Late

The majority of infosec tools are built for assessment of production systems, leaving assessment incomplete or too late for containers

Putting the Sec in DevOps

Secure the Toolchain
 Lock down DevOps infrastructure
 Monitor DevOps scripts  Establish and monitor
security policies for DevOps tools

Automate
 Orchestrate security products with DevOps tools
 Reconcile changes made by DevOps tools automatically

#RSAC
Shift Left
 Add security to the DevOps process prior to deployment
 Check images and containers predeployment
 Monitor production for integrity
