Start With a Strategy
What is the overall goal of the program? What objectives support that goal? What is the scope? What key metrics measure success?

#RSAC
Goal
Ensure compliance with required regulations and standards, and to identify and manage our human risk to an acceptable level.

#RSAC
Objectives
Ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS and GLBA. Identify and manage our top five human risks. Reduce attacker dwell time by 40% through creation of Human Sensor network. Create a positive, cyber-aware culture where people feel responsible for and value cyber security.

#RSAC
Three Key Elements to a Strategic Plan

Who?
Who you are targeting in your program?

What?
What behaviors do you want them to change or exhibit?

How?
How will you change those behaviors?

#RSAC
Top Risk Groups
New programs often start with everyone.
As your program matures, identify high risk groups
­ Developers ­ Leadership ­ Accounts Payable / Financial Transactions ­ Human Resources ­ Help Desk ­ Interns

#RSAC
Manage Your Top Human Risks
Social Engineering / Phishing Passwords Accidental
Once you identify your top human risks, what are the key behaviors that manage those risks?

#RSAC
When You Go Back - Ask
Who is in charge of our awareness program? How many people are dedicated to our program? Where is our communication expertise? Who / What are our top human risks, how do we know? What is our overall strategy for engagement? How do we measure success?

#RSAC
Summary
Until we also start addressing the human element, bad guys will continue to win.
To manage human risk we need to change behavior. To change behavior we need a mature awareness program using a proven framework.
