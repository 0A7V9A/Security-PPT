#RSAC
Fileless attacks
Goal is to avoid the use of malware or other more "visible" tools
­ Use whitelisted/allowed applications ­ Existing software "live off the land" ­ Non-malware executables ­ Vulnerabilities/Exploit Memory ­ Scripts/PowerShell/VBScript/JavaScript ­ HIGHLY obfuscated
Initial Vector
­ Most common vector == Email
o Macro -> PowerShell -> Download (malware) or directly into memory

#RSAC
Weaponizing Documents
Embedding malware in document DDE
­ Different file types (.iqy) ­ Control the error messages
o Not the normal "yellow" warning
VBScript Macro
­ Standard "Enable Macros" warning ­ User's are trained

Demo: Weaponizing Documents

#RSAC
Combatting Fileless Attacks
Gauge the effectiveness of existing solutions:
­ Add fileless attack simulations to your existing exercises
Utilize GPOs to enforce policies around Macros/DDE Look for solutions that "go beyond":
­ Beyond on-disk malware detection ­ Prevent the malicious use of PowerShell/macros/memory-exploits ­ Don't rely on behavioral detection only ­ usually too late
Implement and continually re-verify
­ Continual education and testing improvements
