Jericho Forum: Deperimiterization
1. The scope and level of protection should be specific and appropriate to the asset at risk. 2. Security mechanisms must be pervasive, simple, scalable and easy to manage. 3. Assume context at your own peril. 4. Devices and applications must communicate through open, secure protocols. 5. All devices must be capable of maintaining their security policy on an un-trusted network. 6. All people, processes and technology must have declared and transparent levels of trust for any
transaction to take place. 7. Mutual trust assurance levels must be determinable. 8. Authentication, authorization and accountability must interoperate/exchange outside of your
locus/area of control. 9. Access to data should be controlled by security attributes of the data itself. 10.Data privacy (and security of any asset of sufficiently high value) requires a segregation of
duties/privileges. 11.By default, data must be appropriately secured when stored, in transit, and in use.
