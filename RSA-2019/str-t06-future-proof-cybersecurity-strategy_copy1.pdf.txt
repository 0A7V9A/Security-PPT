What is Good Strategy?
Diagnosis: defines key challenges to overcome
Guiding Policy: the overall approach
Coherent Actions: Set of coherent actions or coordinated steps

#RSAC
What is good (future-proof) cybersecurity strategy?

 Identify key challenges  A framework or
roadmap ­ the big picture Coordinated actions to address challenges Continuous monitoring and adaptation

5 Key Cybersecurity Challenges

#1 Humans are (still) the weakest link in Cybersecurity

"Companies spend millions of dollars on firewalls, encryption, and secure #RSAC access devices ...... none of these measures address the weakest link in the security chain: the people.." Kevin Mitnick

3 must-haves to futureproof cybersecurity strategy

#RSAC
#1 Secure the Human

#RSAC
Roles of humans in cybersecurity

User

Defender

Attacker

Info provider (sensor)

Human Error & Misbehavior Insider Threat
Unintentional
Ignorance Negligence
Lack of awareness and
knowledge
Intentional
Sabotage Theft of IP Espionage Insider Fraud

#RSAC
Reduce risk by managing human factors
RISK = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence

#RSAC
I. Identify High-Value Targets
Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence
- Executives / Executive assistants - Accounting / Finance / HR - Public safety / Elected Officials - System Admins / DBA / Privileged users - IT network and security team

#RSAC
II. Targeted and Persistent Security Awareness Program

Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence

 Risk priorities / topics / target groups matrix

Delivering methods

Newsletters, posters, Security events, CBT, workshops, instructor-led
training, phishing simulation, bug bounty
program

III. Implement tools and processes to prevent and detect #RSAC insider threats
Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence

Layered approach defense

 Email security, web security, perimeter security, sandboxing

 Security Awareness and training, Policy and standards

 EDR, UBA, SIEM, DLP, CASB

The CERT Insider Threat Center

Cyber Situation Awareness Process

#RSAC

(Know Yourself)

Mica Endsley SA Model

Perception

Comprehension

Projection

Decision

1. What happened? 2. What's the impact? 3. How did it happen?

4. What could happen next?

5. What should I do?

Cyber SA

#RSAC
5 Enemies of Cyber Situational Awareness
Attentional Tunneling (lock in on certain data sources, tools and dashboards)
Data overload (excessive alert noise)
Errant Mental Models (incorrectly interprets or ignore relevant alarms)
Misplaced Salience (ineffective data visualization)
Out-of-the-loop Syndrome (rely heavily on process and response automation)

#RSAC
Recommendations
Use S.M.A.R.T dashboards (Simple, Meaningful, Accurate, Relevant and Timely) Use workflows to simplify detect/respond process Develop your SOC team on problem-solving skills, not just technical expertise Promote team collaboration Conduct Simulation Exercise regularly

Example 1: Executive Dashboard

Example 2: CISO Daily Trend

Example 3: Critical Asset Protection

Threat Intelligence (Know Your Enemy)

Actor
who are they?

Intent
What are they trying to achieve?

Capability
What is their ability to achieve the intended goals?

Opportunity
How much do they know about my environment and vulnerabilities?

= Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence Types
· Indicators · Threat Actors and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) · Security alerts / Incidents · Course of action (security advisories, CVEs etc) · Threat intelligence reports (example: Novetta's Operation Blockbuster)

Threat Intelligence Lifecycle
1.Intelligence goals 2. Collection 3.Data enrichment and analysis 4.Utilization (Cyber SA, Detection,
Prevention, and Dissemination)

#3 Collaboration

Why Collaboration?

Average time to detect a breach 191 days

Average time from discovery to 66 days
containment Ponemon Institute 2017

How long does it take to breach a network?

< 15 Hours

Recommendations
· Identify existing internal sources of CTI · Develop Intelligence-driven use cases · Establish information sharing platform, rules and agreements · Join and participate in information sharing efforts · Follow the TLP and protect the security of the shared information
