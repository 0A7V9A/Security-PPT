5 Steps to Top 10 Security Risks

1. Establish a governance process

2. Define a common security risk language

3. Identify risk input

Focus

4. Transform risk input

5. Prioritization

Investment prioritization

Resource alignment

Risk data are facts, numbers, evidence
Risk data trended and interpreted is risk information
Risk information + insight/experience = risk knowledge

Authentication
Authorization
Enrollment / Registration Identification
Privileged Access Management

Authorization and authentication of personnel prior to granting them access to information resources. Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. Decision given to authorize a user, process, or device based on an agreed-upon set of security controls. The enrollment process is based on a set of policies or is manually controlled by the owner of the resource. Creation, management, and deletion of identities without regard to access or entitlements. The management of the processes to control/monitor a user that is authorized to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.

Healthcare Insider Threats
"Verizon 2018 DBIR" produced by verizon.com

Evolution of Ransomware:
· Used in completely opportunistic attacks affecting individuals' home computers as well as targeted strikes against organizations
· Attempted with little risk or cost to the adversary involved
· Successful with no reliance on having to monetize stolen data
· Deployed across numerous devices in organizations to inflict bigger impacts and thus command bigger ransoms

Inside-Out Analysis

Monitor and inspect outbound activity for suspicious or anomalous behavior that may indicate a compromised device or malicious insider.

Physical Security External Trends Infrastructure

Review inputs from Physical Security for potential IT Security impact, including security incident, business disruptions, and world events.
A review of external cyber threats that impact Aetna's threat landscape including brand protection, malware, non-Aetna data breaches, and other threat intelligence items.
Review infrastructure vulnerabilities and other threats impacting infrastructure health
