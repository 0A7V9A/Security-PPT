"I don't believe in astrology; I'm a Sagittarius and we're skeptical."  Arthur C. Clarke

The Metrics Manifesto
1. We believe shrinking attack surface, while not slowing value exposure, is the new job #1 for security 2. We also believe not doing this gives advantage to our adversaries and reduces business opportunity
Most metrics count, the best ones confront
Vulnerability Escape Rates By Severity and By Development Team

#RSAC
The Metrics Manifesto
3. We believe metrics that ignore our uncertainty ignore our adversaries
Most metrics reveal what is certain, the best ones retain what is uncertain

The Manifesto In Action: Escape Rates
Observations: · Escape Rate is a DevOps Metric.
· We use rate as a policy to beat
· We can score the strength of relationships between capabilities and rates.

#RSAC
The Manifesto In Action: Escape Rates
· A new scrum team is like a new ball player, they can inherit the league average.
· The more data the more certainty. i.e. less spread.
· The true "vuln rate" is 95% likely to be within each band
· We can set KPIs, which can be points, just liked the colored lines.

#RSAC
The Manifesto In Action: Advanced Rates

What's the vulnerability escape rate by product based on participating scrum team.

How effective are my remediation SLA? Are we doing enough?

How important is my security development lifecycle (SDL) implementation?

Using Small Data and SME Input To Measure Risk

#RSAC
The Metric Manifesto: Incorporating Frameworks

PROTECT

DETECT

RESPOND

Zero Trust: Progressively fined grained access controls applied to increasingly fine grained assets ­ from platforms to data.
Minimal Attack Surface: Shrinking risk via the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), vulnerability & configuration management.

Complete Visibility: Comprehensive telemetry at wire speed with high availability and increasingly longer history.
Alerting In Depth: Deterministic, heuristic, behavioral and predictive analytics at depth and in breadth that reduce time to detect.

Complete Mitigation: Capabilities that dynamically block malicious activity.

Comprehensive Orchestration: Integrated alerting, workflow and decision analysis that supports response automation.

Response Assurance: Logical, physical, structured and unstructured exercises to provide ongoing response/recovery assurance.
Response Engineering: Security engineering for pursuing, handling and recovering from incidents.
Communications : Communications coordinated across the org, board, third parties, social and general media.

Consistency Score: We put duplicate pairs in our surveys. This measures how much spread there is between their answers. For example, they said on one risk scenario 15% likely. On the same scenario later in the the survey they said 2%. That's a 13% difference. These get averaged.
Discrimination Score: How much spread is in their ratings overall. Are they rating different risks differently.
Quality Score: This is a ratio of consistency over discrimination. The lower the value the better. Low Spread Consistency/High Spread Discrimination

Making It Real With Digital Risk Management

#RSAC
The Metric Manifesto: Digital Risk Management

2017-2019 Breach Forecast

It's Time Based: We make multi-year forecasts to help drive strategy.

It's Tolerance Based: This one has an imagined insurance threshold

It's Capability Based: We model security capability improvement over time

16% chance of losing $20M+

It's Risk As A Curve!: We build a model that relates impact (money) and likelihood.

1% chance of losing $70M+
A map is not the territory .... but if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which
accounts for its usefulness. --Alfred Korzybski in Science & Sanity

It Uses Probabilities: We only use probabilities and dollars ­ no Red, Yellow, Green or High, Medium, Low.
Who else uses these methods? Actuaries, big-pharma, military logisticians, nuclear engineers, epidemiologists, meteorologist, project managers, movie producers etc...anyone making forecasts with seemingly irriducible uncertainty.

Forecasted Betterments · As capabilities mature, or potentially
get worse, risk is adjusted. · Previous breach risk was 8.5% · Current program brings risk to 7.5%

Forecasted Betterments · Uncertain costs, but not entirely · Likelihood adjustments using
calibrated SME inputs · Results in ROI based decision
