Lesson Learned: What I Have Experienced While Implementing GDPR
Michael Mrak Casinos Austria AG @michael_mrak
#RSAC

Are you affected by the GDPR?

#RSAC
That's how I looked at it ...

#RSAC
after the GDPR was published.

The starting situation was decisive ... for a "relatively" simple implementation

#RSAC
We have always dealt well with personal data
A well-established privacy system has existed since 2009 We have had data protection certified since 2010 A directory of processing activities has existed since 2010
­ We call it directory of data protection relevant objects and use the same information for the list of assets also required for information security purposes
Fortunately, there is a very high level of awareness regarding the handling of personal data in my company

A giant project briefly explained

#RSAC
From spring to autumn 2017
Update of the existing data protection management system Update of the the existing documentation of all data protection relevant objects (list of processing activities) Identification and evaluation of all data collections that need to undergo an extended risk analysis
­ Privacy Impact Assessment
Risk-based implementation of the necessary measures to ensure data protection compliance in the affected systems
8

From autumn 2017 until May 2018

#RSAC

... uh, actually until today

· Review of all contracts with service providers (data processors) · Update of consent statements · Adding data breach notification crisis processes to emergency
management (Data Breach Notification Duty) · Training of all employees and internal privacy coordinators · Roadshow and training through all our casinos & rollout of a
compulsory e-learning for all employees · A lot of documentation work

The biggest challenges

#RSAC
Technical limits and social aspects
Some requirements can simply not be implemented
­ A guide for deletion of personal data is ready BUT
o The technical implementation of the concept for data deletion will take years o The documentation of all external data protection requests must be ensured
Although the implementation was set up as a cross-company project, there were often other priorities for the individual business units The internal communication effort was enormous
11

End of the project  End of work

#RSAC
The journey to full GDPR compliance has just begun
Significantly more customer inquiries about data protection The difference between privacy requests and responsible gaming queries is often not obvious at first glance Data protection is now an integral part of all projects in which personal data is used
­ This is already clearly defined in projects today ­ But what about small workgroups that are not subject to the project
guidelines? ­ How to keep awareness high at management level in the future?
13

Which of you has a system in which all personal data is automatically deleted upon request or after the expiry of the permitted storage period?

#RSAC
The journey to full GDPR compliance has just begun
· The implementation for the automatic data deletion will cost a lot of money and nerves
· All measures taken must be periodically reviewed (PDCA management cycle)
· Legal developments will lead to changes
15

#RSAC
Improving the GDPR compliance
16

Some final takeaways!

#RSAC
Important takeaways
Consider data protection as an elementary pillar of compliance Search internal allies Never underestimate the communication effort Search for synergies with existing management systems The conversion of the GDPR leads to more quality
18

The GDPR could be the global ,,gold standard"
