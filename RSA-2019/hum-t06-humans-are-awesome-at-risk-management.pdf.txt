... but now risks are more complex.

Cost Context Matters
You are given one opportunity to play a game.
A fair, 20-sided die will be rolled.
You bet X; if your number is rolled, you keep your bet, and get back 20X; otherwise, you lose your bet.
Your expected payout is thus 1.05.

#RSAC
Would you bet $1? Would you bet $10? Would you bet $100? Would you bet $1,000? Would you bet $10,000? Would you bet $100,000? Would you bet $1,000,000? You value something by what you give up to get it.
