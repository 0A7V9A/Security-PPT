Identifying (MANY) Common Challenges and Best Practices

CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

· No Formal CTIA Workflow / Email as ticketing system
· Cyber threat intelligence analysis Not Incorporated into Larger Cyber Intelligence Workflow
· Inability to Create Cyber threat intelligence analysis Reports; Reports Not Timely and Lacking Data Source Validation
· Cyber Intelligence Teams Lack Diversity in Technical Skills
· Small Cyber Intelligence Teams and Limited Opportunities for Training Hampers Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis:
· Challenges purchasing and building customized tools and technology

· SOAR Technologies Save Time and Resources
· Formulized Process to consistently Create Actionable Cyber threat intelligence analysis Reports
· Get a team with depth and breadth in technical disciplines
· Hire for 3.14 · Culture that Encourages
Everyday Learning and Training · Open-Source, Paid and
Customized Tools and Technologies to support Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis · Machine Learning for Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis

ENVIRONMENT

· Cybersecurity is Cyber Intelligence · Silos of Excellence are not really
excellent · We need more people · Challenges with recruiting and
retaining people · Team Roles and Responsibilities
Unclear · Poor Access to Decision Makers · Cyber Intelligence Workflows are
only conceptual / incomplete · Lack of a repeatable formal threat
prioritization process · We can only focus on today · No Insider Threat Program · Sharing with Insider Threat Team
Unidirectional

· Do a Crown Jewel Exercise · Create a Defined Cyber
Intelligence Team · Use NIST NICE 800-181 · Elevate the CISO in the
Organization · Fusion Centers Enhance
Collaboration · Virtual or Physical Fusion Centers · Get Serious About Physical
Security · Map data collected to Public
Threat Frameworks to Answer SIRs · Prioritize Threats based on Threat
Actor Potential, Target Exposure,
and Organizational Impact · All Data All The Time · Recognize the Importance of the
Future · Have an Insider Threat Team

STRATEGIC CYBER INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS

· SCIA A Priority for Most, Yet Implementation Challenges Remain
· No SCIA Workflow · Not doing Cyber Attribution · Organizations lack personnel
and leadership commitment to perform SCIA · Incorporating Diverse Disciplines to Produce Strategic Cyber Intelligence · No SCIA Tools · Analytical Tradecraft is What?

· Do SCIA · Focus on Strategic Intelligence
and Proactively Collaborate with
other Teams · Cyber Attribution IS Important · Critical Thinking most valued
skill for SCIA · Have SCIA Tools · Analytical Tradecraft IS
Important

REPORTING AND FEEDBACK

· No Formal Reports Produced · Not Doing Predictive Analytics · Actionable Recommendations
are for Cybersecurity only · Executive Leadership (CISO and
up) Not Interested in Cyber Intelligence · Challenges Getting In Front of Leadership · Leadership not Cyber Savvy · Minimal Feedback Mechanism for Analysts · No Feedback: Unclear if Cyber Intelligence Analysis Influence Leadership Decisions · Unclear if Leadership and Consumers are satisfied with cyber intelligence reports · Challenges Demonstrating ROI

· Diverse Product Line · Reports are Accessible · Actionable and Predictive
Analysis · Leadership Actively Involved · Leadership Uses Cyber Intel to
Make Decisions · Leadership Is Accessible · Board Involvement · Analysts Receive Feedback · Build Trust · Demonstrating ROI is Easier
