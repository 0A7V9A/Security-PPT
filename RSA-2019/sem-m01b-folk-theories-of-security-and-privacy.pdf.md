Can't remove the user from all security decisions! A system's security depends on the choices made by its users. So, how do regular users make security decisions? And how can we help them make better choices?

Folk Theories are...
Informal, causal, explanatory "ways of understanding" Develop out of everyday experiences with technologies
­ informal learning based on experience
Help people envision what might happen, based on what they already know Incomplete, and not necessarily technically accurate Useful "rules of thumb" that guide decision-making!

Stories from "regular" users explain agency: connecting who attacks with the type of attack Experts explain method: connecting the types of attack with preventative measures News articles explain consequences, but for society not for individuals

When are folk theories important?

#RSAC
Folk theories are important when...
Learning from experience Choosing to take protective action Consenting to data collection
17

#RSAC
Learning from experience:
Software updates are becoming more automated, but...
­ people often don't have the settings they intend ­ people don't consistently choose the settings they want
Automating the install of software updates provides few opportunities to learn This makes it harder for people to learn how to connect cause and effect
18

#RSAC
Choosing to take protective action:
Belief that one could be a target of hackers associated with taking protective action
­ But, belief that hackers target other people (not me) was NOT associated with protective action
Belief that viruses cause visible problems associated with using antivirus
­ But, belief that you can "catch" a virus simply by browsing the internet was NOT associated with protective action
19

#RSAC
Consenting to data collection:
Privacy self-management relies on user consent Consent depends on awareness -- folk theories! Awareness is about what's visible, and therefore "know-able" to users:
­ visible in terms of what a person can imagine being directly collected ­ and also in terms of what the interface shows to them
20

#RSAC
What does this mean?
Hiding security and privacy from users means they can't learn from experience Identify decision points where it is important to include users, such as:
­ Authentication ­ Software Updates ­ Consent
Design feedback that augments what users already believe

"Technical experts will evaluate folk theory from this perspective [correctness] -- not by asking whether it fulfills the needs of the folk. But it is the latter criterion[...] on which sound public policy must be based."
