The probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss associated with a specific event
The way in which possible losses may materialize are articulated in risk scenarios describing the action of a threat onto an asset of value and the resulting effect

1) Latest threat intel says a 1:3 mix of cyber criminals / general hackers is attacking  2) Effectiveness of vulnerability control system (firewalls, traffic scrubbing) as calibrated against the known threat continuum
3) Responsive controls in place and expected to contain 50% of successful attacks
