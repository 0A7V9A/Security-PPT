Pre-survey Expertise, Demographics, Experience
I often ask others for help with the computer.
Do you know any computer programming languages?
Have you ever suffered data loss for any reason? (ex. Hacking, data corruption, hard drive failure.)

Interview Questions
How could you test to confirm that your key is working? If your key was lost or stolen, what would you do? (ie. Do you understand the recovery process?) Based on your current understanding of the technology, could you use the same key with an account on another web site, or would you need to obtain an additional key? Based on your current understanding, could you add a second key to your account? Do you see any benefits from using the security key? Please explain. Do you expect to continue to use your key after today? Why or why not? How would you remove a key from your account if you decided to? Do you use alternative emails or file sharing to avoid 2FA?

#RSAC
Participant Choices ­ Phase I (Follow Up)
Participants dropped keys None reported continuing use after the study They discussed they do not find any value by using the keys to secure their accounts
13

#RSAC
Participant Evaluation ­ Phase I
"No, my password is secure enough and alerts are active."
"Why is it still asking for a password?"
"Probably not [on] gmail is not important. Would have used for work". "For my use, No, it is inconvenient to use. The reason is that I don't have any sensitive information."

Analysis

Transcription
Think aloud results Interview questions

Qualitative coding
Three independent coders
Create code book from identified themes
Set of themes or codes to represent all notable data

Qualitative clustering
Halt Point: participants could not move forward without help
Confusion Point: slowed or stopped, expressed desire for help
Value perception: statements about the perceived utility

Results
Discussion: return to transcripts as needed for nuance
Analysis: coding allows quantitative as well as qualitative
Recommendations

Participant Evaluation ­ Phase II
"I find it much easier to use on Duo (2 factor) instead of using my phone. I just keep it in my laptop case." "It's a convenient way of utilizing two factor authentication without needing to look at my mobile device." "Improve ease of access for me."
"...I don't use it much because I almost never use a computer that is not my personal computer and the account that I set it up with is not one that I need to access very often anyway." "Too lazy."

Why We Don't Use MFA -- Solutions
· Hassle
· Providing the technology is not enough
· We cannot predict
· Watch in-action
· Why use? Too Lazy
· Risk communication for motivation
· Research, Application
· Qualitative studies and Quantitative Studies
