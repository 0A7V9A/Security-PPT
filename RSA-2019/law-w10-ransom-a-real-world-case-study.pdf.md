Subject: Time for some payback
Ahoy! Congratulations on your Q3 earnings- very impressive! I'm sure your board and investors are very happy with the tremendous financial success of the company. But as we all know, it doesn't take much for things to take a turn for the worse ­ especially at Pequod. I have some information that could sink your company fast. But don't worry, I'm not planning to put it to use as long as you do what I ask. Attached is a small sample of what I have. Rest assured there is a LOT more where that came from. I'm sure you don't want this stuff to show up on Wikileaks! I will be in touch soon with instructions for you to follow. Have a great day!
Sincerely,
Harpooned

Hello. I hope by now you have had a chance to look at the package I sent last week and know that I am very serious. You are probably wondering what I want. I've been thinking about that too. I know you've got plenty of money so that shouldn't be an issue. I will want to be paid in Bitcoin though so you will need to go buy some of that. I want 2000 BTC deposited into two different wallets (1000 BTC in each) with the following IDs:
1B2S4Nf8jD3fshHodzuYhlamoQsQaZEcZ 1B2S4Nf8jD3gtIpuOeyklAndRtMyywFBVcXvv I will give you one week from today to make the deposits ­ or I start releasing info. Sincerely, Harpooned

FBI VISIT

The Reply

DAY 7 THROUGH 12
From: Bob Ishmael [MD General Counsel] Sent: Friday, November 23, 2018 6:07 PM To: harpooned@hmamail.com Subject: RE: Time to Pay
Call me Bob. I am the General Counsel and will be taking responsibility for communications with you on behalf of the company so please direct future messages to me.
We need more time to make payment arrangements. There are a number of approvals we need to get internally and we also need to work with our bank to figure out the best way to acquire bitcoins. It is not easy to buy that much BTC in one shot so we will have to break up the purchases. To show that we are working in good faith on this, please see the attached screenshot from Coinbase explaining their limit on daily BTC purchase volume. We will need at least 30 days to get this figured out.
We may be willing to make an initial payment as a further showing of good faith.
We ask that you show your good faith by sharing the totality of the data you have stolen from us.
- Bob Ishmael
