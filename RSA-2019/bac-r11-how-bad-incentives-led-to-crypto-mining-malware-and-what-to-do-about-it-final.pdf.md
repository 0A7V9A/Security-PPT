Incentives and "Side Effects"

#RSAC

#RSAC
"Side Effects" ... or Just "Effects"?
"SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT A FEATURE OF REALITY BUT A SIGN THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM IS NARROW AND FLAWED."
John D. Sterman, Business Dynamics

So, What Does This Have to Do With Blockchain?

#RSAC
Decentralization Drove Proof of Work
"...a piece of data which is difficult (costly, timeconsuming) to produce but easy for others to verify..." (Bitcoin Wiki)

Proof of Work Incentive Schemes

Platform Bitcoin

Proof of Work Scheme Hashcash

Ethereum Zcash

Ethash Equihash

#RSAC
Incentive 12.5 bitcoin per mined block (halves every 210,000 blocks) Five (5) ether per mined block 12.5 ZEC per mined block (halves every 840,000 blocks)

Welcome to Cryptojacking!

How Profitable Is Cryptojacking?

High Potential

Lower in Reality?

"...a botnet of 100,000 bots carrying out browser-based mining, running continuously for 30 days, could make $30,000, or a file-based miner could make $750,000. The potential is there for big results in cryptojacking, but scale is a key part of the equation."

"With a hash rate of 80 H/s and CoinHive's payout ratio8 , a miner earns about 5.8 USD per day and website on average, which supports our observation that web-based cryptojacking currently provides only limited profit."

Crypto Mining Malware vs. Ransomware

Crypto Mining Malware
Low visibility - could sit on a system for months
Low to moderately disruptive
Victim does not pay directly ... but will bear costs of resource misuse

Ransomware
Highly visible almost immediately Highly disruptive Victim pays the ransom (or not) ­ financial impact apparent

Why are my critical business systems running so slowly?
13

#RSAC
"Why did our power and cloud usage bills go up 40% last month, when our revenues were flat?!?"

#RSAC
Some may call crypto mining malware an unintended side effect of public blockchain ... but it's just an effect that illustrates our lack of understanding of the system.

So, What Can You Do?

#RSAC
Our Role in The Ecosystem: What Choices Can We Make?

Implement Blockchain Application
Build New Blockchain Platforms

Choose a Blockchain Platform

#RSAC
Private/Consortium Blockchain
PARTICIPATION IS THE INCENTIVE
Node work is the cost of doing business Private and consortium chains typically permissioned, so bad actors can't join

#RSAC
Change The Incentives?

No Incentive
Limit How Much An Account Can Mine in a Given Time Period Product Discounts / Transaction Fee Discounts

Back to the original problem: how to get nodes to participate? Miners will just create multiple accounts...
Miners more likely to care about the product or service
Discounts must be compelling enough to incent your users

Incentives to find and report weaknesses

Ensure discounts can't be misused (e.g., stacked)
Encourages good community behavior; can finding weaknesses be more profitable than exploiting them?

What If We Don't Use Proof of Work?

#RSAC
What If We Don't Use Proof of Work?

What is it?
Pros Cons

Proof of Stake
· New block creator chosen based on wealth/stake
· "Miners" (called forgers) take transaction fees
· Prospective forgers join validator pool to be selected
· Variants: Randomized, Age-Based, Delegated
· Forgers don't use computing power · Environmental impact reduced · Forgers must already own currency
· Lack of computing power requirements may enable other attacks
· The "Nothing-At-Stake" problem

Proof of Capacity / Proof of Space · Allocate disk or memory space
rather than computing cycles
· Environmental impact reduced
· Modified malware could take over memory space

22

Other Options
Ripple
­ Primarily for banking, reducing settlement time
­ No mining
IOTA
­ Tangle, not blockchain ­ Designed for scalability ­ Reward for validating
transaction is to have your transaction validated

Conclusion

#RSAC
Summary
Incentives are hard There's no such thing as "side effects" Crypto mining malware is an effect of blockchain incentive design There are other options for incentives that might reduce cryptojacking But everything has an effect ... study the system carefully

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Look at platform and incentive options for current blockchain projects, consider effects and determine whether different approaches needed to reduce cryptojacking risk
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Learn more about system dynamics, incentives, effects and policy resistance ­ Evaluate incentive options when selecting blockchain platforms for future projects
Within six months you should:
­ Watch for new incentive options and platforms, analyze potential effects and determine how they address your business case and risk model
­ Consider effects of any incentive program in your organization (blockchain or otherwise)
26

Apply Understanding of Incentives and Effects to Any System In Your Organization (Security Awareness, Bonuses, etc.)
