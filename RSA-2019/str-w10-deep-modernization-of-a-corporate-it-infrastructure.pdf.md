Some mind-boggling stats from the 2018 HIMSS

#RSAC

Cybersecurity Survey

· 13% have no dedicated cybersecurity staff
· 17% are not using a security framework · 20% don't pen test · 24% have no insider threat programs

Top concerns: · Data leakage · Ransomware · Credential stealing
malware

· 27% have no specific cybersecurity budget set aside

How to modernize

The foundation of the modern security paradigm

Zero Trust

Machine Learning

17

Zero Trust

#RSAC
Zero Trust

19

#RSAC
What Zero Trust is (and isn't)

Is
Concept and architectural model
Combination of processes and technologies
Restricted movement ­ greater security
Unified experience - greater flexibility and productivity for staff and partners

Isn't
· Not about "trusting no one" · Not a "next-generation perimeter" · Not network segmentation · Not a "VPN modernization"

· Not an off-the-shelf product

· Not an IT-only job

20

#RSAC
Why Zero Trust?
Attacks come from inside and outside corporate networks There is no "inside" anymore anyway User credentials, especially passwords, are often compromised In the era of BYOD, devices are often not secured properly

#RSAC
What Zero Trust means for Data
Asset Discovery
­ You cannot protect what you don't even know exists
Data Discovery & Classification
­ Not all data is created equal, and every organization has its own data taxonomy
Data Flows
­ Identifying sensitive data flows between apps, users, devices is the foundation for securing them
Data Protection
­ All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transfer
Data Security Analytics
­ Minimizing time for breach and incident response
23

#RSAC
What Zero Trust means for Identity

User
·Identity Governance ·Multi-Factor Authentication ·Behavior Analytics ·Adaptive Authentication

Device
·Device Discovery and Inventory ·Device Identity ·Endpoint Protection ·Privilege Management

24

Context
·User attributes ·Device attributes ·Network environment ·Geolocation, Time, etc. ·Threat Intelligence

#RSAC
What Zero Trust means for Network
Stop thinking in terms of "Intranet", "DMZ", or "VPN" It's application- and user-centric, not infrastructure-centric No network session without authentication and authorization Mandatory network traffic encryption Monitor everything
25

What Zero Trust means for Access Management
· Least Privilege
o every access limited to a specific user, device, and app or resource only o Just enough privilege to get the job done, (if admin - revoke afterwards)
· Centralized
o access control policies are managed centrally o policies are standardized across heterogeneous IT systems o policies are defined in uniform notation for both business and IT
· Dynamic
o access / authorization decisions are made in real-time o common requirements and individual attributes influence each decision
· Adaptive
o open to support new authentication and authorization methods o processing relevant intel: cyber threat, fraud, compromised credentials, etc.

#RSAC
Zero Trust Case Study # 1
US financial services company Relatively weak authentication methods for online transactions: Username/password + KBA Externally developed mobile app built on SDK which utilized Android/iOS biometrics Recommendation: integrate online/mobile and use mobile push notifications for HVT authorization
29

#RSAC
Zero Trust Case Study # 2
High-tech hardware supply chain Critical IP assets identified, classified, protected on-prem with MFA and ABAC. BU participating in joint venture copied certain critical IP assets to cloud-based collaboration service; protected only with username/password. Recommendation:
­ Deploy CASB, synchronize authentication and access control policies as well as data.
­ Deploy data governance and DLP to prevent users from doing an end-run around other controls.

Detection is hard
Too many logs, FPs, malware variants, etc. to
do it manually

Where does ML come into play for cybersecurity and #RSAC IAM?

Firewalls, WAFs, API Gateways Anti-Malware Threat Hunting Data Governance AuthZ & Access Control Policies Advanced Authentication SIEM/UBA

Analysis of traffic patterns
Millions of malware variants Volume of data across thousands of nodes Auto-classification of data objects Analysis of access patterns and regulations to autogenerate rules and polices Evaluation of potentially large volumes of user/env data Efficient user access baselining and anomaly detection
