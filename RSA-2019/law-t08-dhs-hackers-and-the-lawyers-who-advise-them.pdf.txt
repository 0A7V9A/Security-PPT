Detailed Findings

#RSAC
Cybersecurity Implicates Many Areas of Law
­ Criminal Law
o 18 U.S.C. § 1030 - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
· Accessing a computer "without authorization or exceeding authorized access"
o 18 U.S.C. § 2511 ­Wiretap Act
­ Torts and Contract Law: What constitutes a "protected computer"? ­ Constitutional Law: primarily the Fourth Amendment ­ Corporate/Employment Law: Get Phished Adverse Employee Action? ­ State Data Breach Law: Pen Tester exposure to sensitive data ­ Cyber Info Sharing: Cyber Info Sharing Act of 2015 and data protections
We use a Rules of Engagement (RoE) document to address these issues.
