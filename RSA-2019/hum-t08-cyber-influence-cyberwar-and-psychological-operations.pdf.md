The PSYOP Mission

Fallujah, Iraq

#RSAC
While much attention is spent on adjusting weapons systems and training soldiers and Marines to use them, what may be of more value in an urban fight is the work being done years before a conflict erupts.
Experts frequently tout the success of psychological operations units in the run up to the second battle of Fallujah in late 2004. They worked to inform the city's residents that the battle would soon unfold and warned them to evacuate.
As a result, an estimated 90 percent of the population fled, freeing up Marines to fight with fewer constraints than if there was a substantial number of civilians present.

Cyber Media Jamming

#RSAC

Electromagnetic jamming is the deliberate radiation, reradiation, or reflection of electromagnetic energy for the purpose of preventing or reducing an enemy's effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum, and with the intent of degrading or neutralizing the enemy's combat capability (see: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp 3-13-1.pdf).

#RSAC
Why are US Cyber Influence Operations Ineffective?
· Information is an unappreciated and underused instrument of government power.
· Department of State Public Diplomacy has been eviscerated.
· Cyber Command would rather shoot `electrons' than ideas'.
· Influence is not represented at the targeting table.
