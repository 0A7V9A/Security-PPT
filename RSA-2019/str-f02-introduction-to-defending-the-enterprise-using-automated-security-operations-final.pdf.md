Automation: What is it?

What is Security Orchestration, Automation and

#RSAC

Response(SOAR)?

SOAR is the integration of disparate security platforms to complete workloads leveraging various levels of human interaction.

#RSAC
Why is Automation Important?
62% of Organizations report Security Challenges related to the Lack of skilled staff (SANS 2018 SOC Report)
­ Addressing the skills gap with automation allows organizations to improve their security posture by improving the efficiency of resources already present

"Automation Is Easy"
-Nobody

#RSAC
What are security teams saying about automation?
50% of Organizations Report Challenges related to Lack of automation and orchestration (Second only to the hiring of skilled staff) (SANS 2018 SOC Report)
Only 18% of organizations feel they have implemented an effective Security Automation Strategy (SANS 2018 SOC Report)

Automation: Where do I Start?

#RSAC
The Four Paths to Automated Security Operations

Hybrid Implementation
leveraging Professional
Services

Building out your own from
"scratch"

Level of Customization

Leveraging a managed service

Purchasing a pre-configured
offering

Ease of Implementation

Building Out Your Own From "Scratch"

Level of Customization

 Pros: · Full Customization · No Functional or External Limitations
 Cons: · High Cost to Effectively Implement
(Time/Resources)
· Must Self-Correct for any updates and
changes to any external platforms
· Significant Ongoing Maintenance

Level of Customization

Purchasing a Pre-Configured Offering

 Pros: · Provides a great base to build on · Frees up time to implement automations
and integrate tools
 Cons: · Functionality Partially Dependent on
Vendor

Hybrid Development Leveraging Professional Services

 Pros:
· Flexibility to Implement Custom
Configurations with ease
· Gain Insight and Validation from Third
Party
 Cons:
· External Development Resource is
potentially shared and may limit speed of implementation

Leveraging a Managed Service
 Pros: · Near-Instant Return On Investment (Post-

#RSAC
How Do I choose the right path?
Cost Considerations
­ Resources
o Financial o Personnel
Organizational Knowledge
­ "Does your organization have people who truly `know' what to do?"
o Extensive operational experience o Comprehensive existing workflows/playbooks
Enterprise Resources
­ "Is there any resistance to automating certain actions (such as blocking IP's or domains automatically)?"
­ "Does your security team have access to (or have the buy-in of IT) to implement the automations you are looking to do?"
­ "Do your platforms support the pace of automation planned?"

#RSAC
I've settled on a path, now what?
With all paths:
­ Ensuring there is an understanding regarding the following:
o Expected Deliverables o SLA's/SLO's o Continuous Improvement Plan
If leveraging a managed service or purchasing a preconfigured offering:
­ Balancing Expectations Vs. Realities
o You are not the only client...
· ...however, you can leverage the collective knowledge gained by others
If Building Your own or Leveraging External Contractors
­ Defining your automation goals and benchmarks ­ Determining what is in-scope and out-of-scope
o Do I implement an automated block or do I automate a notification to an engineer for validation?

#RSAC
Where Not to begin your Automation Journey
Buy a product/solution without an implementation plan
­ Avoid buying "shelfware"
o Review existing documented processes o Validate organizational knowledge of existing platforms o Define # of FTE available for automation management
Trying to automate everything on day one
­ Prioritize your automations using the following criteria:
o Is there buy-in for the workflow? o Is the workflow repeatable? o Is there an API or script? o Is it Time-Consuming?

#RSAC
Tactical Orchestration vs Strategic Automation
Tactical Orchestration
­ Individual Tasks or Workflows
o Implementation of Security Exceptions
Strategic Automation
­ Combination of Orchestrations to complete a Full Security Response
o End To End Incident Response Playbook

How can I measure my organizations Automation

#RSAC

Effectiveness?

Level One
­ Manual Processing

Level Two
­ Limited Orchestration
­ No Automation

Level Three
­ Significant Orchestration
­ Some Automation

Level Four
­ Full Orchestration
­ Significant Automation

Level Five
­ End to End SOAR Implementation

#RSAC
How To Calculate ROI
Document the steps to your workflow Determine the time needed to manually complete every step Use a normalized salary to calculate cost/minute (keep note that no downtime is factored into the calculation) Document the time needed to complete the action using automation Compare the time and cost between manual and automated processing

Automation Return on Investment

April-December 2017
­ Addressing the Basics
o 50-100 Automated Events/Day
o $75k ROI
o 5 Active Playbooks

End of 2018
­ Enhancing the Lineup
o 1,000 Automated Events/Day
o $500k ROI
o 17 Active Playbooks

#RSAC
End of 2019
­ Closing the Loop
o ~25,000 Automated Events/Day
o $10M ROI o 25 Active
Playbooks

Automation: What Can I Do?

What are some things I can automate?
Basic Automated Phishing Analysis
­ Gathering Submissions ­ Conducting Analysis ­ Implementing desired actions based on findings
Automated Alert Analysis and Remediation
­ Forwarding alerts to automation platforms ­ Conducting an Investigation ­ Establishing a remediation plan
Temporary Security Exception Management
­ Manual or Automated Input
o Examples:
· Temporary Network Access · Temporary Escalated Permissions
­ Orchestrated Implementation ­ Effective Reporting

#RSAC

#RSAC
How can I get this done in my organization?
Next 30 Days
­ Identify opportunities for automation within your organization ­ Verify buy-in from potentially involved or impacted groups
Before Next Budget Cycle
­ Develop an implementation plan suitable to your operation ­ Validate your capex/opex costs to limit possible delays
During The Implementation
­ Ensure that resources are available to complete the process ­ Document contingency plans should an automation stop functioning

#RSAC
Key Takeaways
Ensure that your financial and organizational resources are sufficient to move forward with a chosen path.
Establish a Security Automation strategy before acquiring and/or implementing a solution.
Maintain implementation guidelines and continuous improvement benchmarks that are clear and appropriate.
