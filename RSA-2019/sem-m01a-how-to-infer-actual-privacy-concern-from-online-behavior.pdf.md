The Privacy Paradox
2

#RSAC
Conclusion
People do not really care about their online privacy

#RSAC
Many flaws in that conclusion
Asymmetric information
­ Average Internet user cannot have a clear picture of all the consequences of online behaviors
Cognitive/behavioral/emotional biases
­ People are not utility-maximizing machines
Risk perception
­ When there are benefits, risks are perceived as lower
... Are we even using the right metrics?

Example

#RSAC
Only 14% deleted Facebook, so they don't really care about privacy

#RSAC
What if we asked the following question instead?
Did people change their posting behavior on Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal?

#RSAC
We asked a similar question for Twitter
Did people change their use of sensitive* words on Twitter after the Snowden revelations about Government surveillance?
* that are monitored by the Department of Homeland Security or DHS (cybersecurity, terrorism, infrastructure security...)

#RSAC
Data
12 months (~80 TB) of data (18 bln Tweets)
22 weeks before and 29 weeks after June 6, 2013

#RSAC
Methodology
Combine machine learning with econometrics
­ ML algorithm finds anomalies in trends of word counts, and suggests how to solve problems caused by unmet assumptions of econometric model
­ Econometric analysis estimates size and significance of effect by comparing sensitive to non-sensitive (food-related) words, and establishes causality

#RSAC
Results
Sensitive words decreased more than non-sensitive ones after Snowden revelations

#RSAC
Research questions ­ and answers
Did awareness of Government surveillance programs affect the way people express themselves on Twitter?
­ Yes, self-censoring (chilling) effect of about 1%
Where is the effect more pronounced?
­ Chilling appears to have a disproportionate effect on the US, "Blue" states

#RSAC
Conclusion
Inferring privacy concern from online behavior is hard! There may be no privacy paradox at all depending on what metrics we use
