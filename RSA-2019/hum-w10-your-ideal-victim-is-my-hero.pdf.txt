#RSAC
 Too much focus on threat actors can be overwhelming.
 Figuring out every attack vector will make you crazy.
 Picking the "best defense" is nothing short of a miracle.

#RSAC
What if it doesn't have to be so difficult?

#RSAC
The Ideal Victim.

#RSAC
What do we know about Adversaries?
· An adversary is a person or group that sets out to take
advantage of a weakened person or thing for personal gain.
· Adversaries spend most of their time on crafting, trading and
sharpening weapons.
· Adversaries have the odds on their side. · An adversary is nothing without a victim.

#RSAC
Why study ideal victims?
Unlike attacks and adversaries:
· the number of victims is bounded · victims are easier to study · victims share intuitive commonalities · victims are easy to synthetically replicate

#RSAC
What is an ideal victim?
· An ideal victim is an attractive target for an adversary. · Victims have personal and system characteristics which
identify them as worth pursuing.
· The larger the pool of an ideal victim type the more
pervasive and persistent the adversary.

Cyber Victim Model (CVM)

Send a phishing email to a list of people to gain authentication credentials

{HOW} {WHY}

{WHO}

Very few "why's" but focus here can create significant unnecessary friction

#RSAC
Cyber Victim Model (CVM)

Send a phishing email to a list of people to gain authentication credentials

{HOW} {WHY}

{WHO}

 Is this a valuable list or cruft?  Why are these people on this list?  Who's on this list?  How could we predict these victims?  How many phishing emails need to be sent?

#RSAC
Test "Victims"

#RSAC
Why use Deception & Honeypots?
· Creating a sitting duck can be very rewarding · It's a powerful capability for understanding adversary interest · Honeypots are commonly deployed and intel can be shared · There is a high level of fidelity in the results
