The Four Key Questions

?

?

?

Where are we exposed?

Where should we prioritize based
on risk?

How are we reducing
exposure over time?

?
How do we compare?

A Better Way

#RSAC
Deal With Vulnerability Overload

16,500 VULNERABILITIES DISCLOSED IN 2018

7%
of vulnerabilities had
an exploit available

63%
of vulnerabilities discovered in environments are CVSS 7+

12%
of vulnerabilities disclosed in 2018
were CVSS 9+

#RSAC
If Everything Is Important ­ Nothing Is
CVSS SCOREs 59% - CRITICAL/HIGH

#RSAC
CVSS ­ shortcomings
"CVSS is designed to identify the technical severity of a vulnerability. What people seem to want know, instead, is the risk a vulnerability or flaw poses to them, or how quickly they should respond to a vulnerability."

Needles In The Haystack

#RSAC
- Approximately 1,500 exploitable vulnerabilities were published in 2018
- Just over 28 exploitable vulnerabilities every week.

RISK BASED SCORING

#RSAC
Reducing The Burden

Research Insights
Data science based analysis of over 100,000 vulnerabilities to differentiate between the real and theoretical risks vulnerabilities pose
Vulnerability Score
The criticality, ease of exploit and attack vectors associate with the flaw.
Threat Intelligence
Insight into which vulnerabilities are actively being exploited by both targeted and opportunistic threat actors.

PREDICTIVE
PRIORI1T6IZATION

97%
Reduction in vulnerabilities to be remediated with the same
impact to the attack surface

#RSAC
Modeling: Predictive Prioritization

150 different aspects in 7 feature groups:

 Past threat pattern  Past hostility

 CVSS

 Vulnerable software

 NVD

 Exploit code

 Past threat source

Over 109,000 vulnerabilities tracked Probability of exploit tracked for 28 days Updated daily

CVSS TO VPR: MORE LOW/MEDIUM ­ FEWER HIGH/CRITICAL

Apply What We've Discussed
Next week you should:
­ Begin developing a plan to reduce your Cyber Exposure
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Identify all your assets, including IT & OT ­ Prioritize vulnerabilities in a predictive manner
Within six months you should:
­ Identify your critical assets ­ Measure & benchmark your cyber risks ­ internally & externally
