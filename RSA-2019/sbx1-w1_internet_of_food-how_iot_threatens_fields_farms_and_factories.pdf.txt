Industrialization of Food Production
The need to feed...
­ 7.7 billion people as of 2018 ­ Projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050
Less farmers
­ 2 out of 3 persons would be living in urban environments
No additional farmland please
­ Agriculture and ranching are the biggest reasons for forest loss

What to do?

Audit IoT devices and identify underlying OS, applications, services and opened ports. Look for common vulnerabilities and poor security configurations.

User Education: we are asking farmers to operate technologies they may not be familiar with, or understand the risk implications.

IT best practices apply:
­ Secure configurations ­ Threat of phishing ­ Patching and device management

Conclusion

IoT in farming and food production is a national and global concern.

A successful attack results in tangible losses ­ lost growing cycle, financial loss, environmental concerns.
