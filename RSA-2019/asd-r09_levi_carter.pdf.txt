Definitely not an APT ...

Message from ISIS August 11, 2015
"We are in your emails and computer systems, watching and recording your every move, we have your names and addresses, we are in your emails and social media accounts, we are extracting confidential data and passing on your personal information to the soldiers of the khilafah, who soon with the permission of Allah will strike at your necks in your own lands!"

"When ISIL released the information, they instructed their "soldiers" to "strike at [the] necks" of those government employees. Those government employees must now live in constant fear that a
member of ISIL will use that information to find and harm them."
