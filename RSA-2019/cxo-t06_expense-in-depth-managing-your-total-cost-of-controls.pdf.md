Today's Reality
ElpOiusr Pandora's Box Information security is an economic inefficiency.

#RSAC
What Is Economic Efficiency?
Economic efficiency implies an economic state in which every resource is optimally allocated to serve each individual or entity in the best way while minimizing waste and inefficiency.
The ideal state is related to the welfare of the population as a whole with peak efficiency also resulting in the highest level of welfare possible based on the resources available.

#RSAC
Today's Reality
Our approach to information security is the cause of economic inefficiency.

What is Expense in Depth?
A culture of controls that focuses on adding additional controls to make up for the short comings of key controls that failed...

#RSAC

Is the Control

a risk prevention? executed manually? understandable? scalable? verifiable? sustainable? scoped appropriately? timely? mandatory? measurable? repeatable?

Control Design Score
Strong: control is designed properly to mitigate risk
Insufficient: control is not designed to mitigate the risk sufficiently (only partially/slightly reduces the risk, doesn't mitigate it)
Flawed: not designed properly to mitigate risk

#RSAC
Control Design Review Actions
If a control is insufficient or flawed · Redesign it: so that it is strong · Remove it: stop wasting money and
time with a "false sense of control"

#RSAC
Total Cost
An economic measure that sums all expenses paid to produce a product, purchase an investment, or acquire a piece of equipment including not only the initial cash outlay but also all the other expenses associated with operations over a period of time. It includes the addition of all costsdirect and indirect.
It measures the total fixed, variable, and overhead expenses associated with producing a good.
This is a fundamental concept for business owners and executives because it allows them to track the combined costs of their operations.

Total Cost of Controls
Obvious Direct Cash Buckets
AV replacement Security operations Hunting team Investigations Legal Help desk calls ­ Performance complaints ­ Infection related issues IT operations costs ­ IT emergency response ­ Infrastructure costs ­ Rebuild/re-image costs Cost of a breach

#RSAC
Less Obvious Direct Cash Buckets
De-clutter other controls ­ Other endpoint products (agent reduction) ­ Other control products Extending PC and server lifecycle ­ Headroom back due to performance Other IT operations costs ­ EOL'd systems ­ delayed upgrades ­ Change patching windows ­ Servers can be protected ­ normally cannot
complete disk scan with AV ­ Reduce infrastructure costs due to less
"chattiness" with cloud

#RSAC
Cost of Control Friction
Controls are a "drag coefficient" on business velocity
­ Slow the user ­ Slow a business process
Too much control friction
­ Business and users go around security and IT
o Adds cost ­ IT isn't managing IT anymore
· Data and business silos are created · Loss of purchasing power
­ Adds risk
o Risk and Security team becomes blind ­ can't prevent, hard to detect
Business adheres to the controls ­ generates systemic business risk
­ Lose time to market ­ Lose ability to innovate ­ Lose long-term market leadership

Example 1: No Hard Drive Leaves Intel ­ circa 2006

Flawed Control
40% Failure Rate

Flawed Control
No Money for Remediation $5M in new equipment plus $2M annually for labor

#RSAC
Innovation Comes Through Starvation

Manual Control
Equipment $50,000 Labor $20 per hour Over 30,000 hard drives a year

Strong Control
No $$$ Needed Bonus ­ Recycling Benefit

Example 2: 14,000 ATM Machines ­ Windows 2003

Flawed Control
Unable To Patch Traditional AV : 20-40% effective

Flawed Control

#RSAC
Upgrades Are Expensive and Patching Is No Panacea

Insufficient Control
Upgrade ATM Equipment $140M + Labor to install
+ Other applications require updates + Cost of continued patching Traditional AV still...

Strong Control
AI/ML pre-execution prevention tech - $300,000 Includes ­ device control, application control, memdef
$3M to $5M ­ additional network segmentation $2M other ATM fraud mitigation

Example 3: Data Loss

"Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues prior to this cyber attack, the data breach could have been prevented."

Insufficient and Flawed Control

Patching
Vulnerability Scanning Tool
Traditional AV

Network and Host IDS
Encryption
DLP
+ more tools and lots of labor

#RSAC
The Report contained 11 remedial recommendations 1. Enhance vulnerability scanning and patch management processes and procedures; 2. Reduce the scope of sensitive data retained in backend databases; 3. Increase restrictions and controls for accessing data housed within critical databases; 4. Enhance network segmentation, to restrict access from internet facing systems to backend databases and data stores; 5. Deploy additional web application firewalls and tuning signatures to block attacks; 6. Accelerate the deployment of file integrity monitoring technologies on application and web servers; 7. Enforce additional network, application, database, and systemlevel logging; 8. Accelerate deployment of a privileged account management solution; 9. Enhance visibility for encrypted traffic by deploying additional inline network traffic decryption capabilities; 10. Deploy additional endpoint detection and response agent technologies; and 11. Deploy additional email protection and monitoring technologies.

Prevention and Panama

#RSAC
How It Began
In 1879, the French started building the Panama Canal. Torrential rains averaging 200 inches a year washed away much of the work.

#RSAC
A Toxic Control
The Solution? Quinine... ...but the quinine used to treat malaria left many workers deaf.

#RSAC
The Timeline

1903 Panama declares itself a
country. U.S. gains construction rights.
Feb. 1904 U.S. Congress officially
created the Panama Canal Zone.

1909
Work on canal locks begins.

Aug. 15, 1914 Canal officially opens in August.
1913 Panama Canal finishes.

#RSAC
Problem? Solution.
Major Ronald Ross discovered that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes. The control of malaria was vital for the construction of the Panama Canal.

#RSAC
A Man... His Plan... And A Canal.
Experts on sanitation.
Col. W.C. Gorgas, along with others in 1904, formed the sanitary department for the canal zone.

#RSAC
Malaria Control Program Results
Eradication of yellow fever
Death rate dropped in workers from 11.59 per 1,000 in November 1906 to 1.23 per 1,000 in December 1909
Death rate dropped in total population from 16.21 per 1,000 in July 1906 to 2.58 per 1,000 in December 1909

#RSAC
Economic Efficiency
The construction of the panama canal was made possible only after yellow fever and malaria were controlled.

#RSAC
Lessons for Security
Malaria wasn't eliminated, but the root causes were identified, the source of problems were prevented, and construction was completed, leading to dramatic worldwide social and economic benefit.

Applying the Lessons
1. Treat information security as an economic inefficiency 2. Understand total costs 3. Understand strong control design

#RSAC
Applying the Lessons
1. We need to create a demonstrable and sustainable bend in the curve of risk
2. We need to lower / flatten the total cost of controls 3. We need to reduce the control friction on our users and on
our businesses

#RSAC
Applying the Lessons
1. Hold the security industry accountable for its failures 2. Focus on societal risk 3. Stop accepting compromise
