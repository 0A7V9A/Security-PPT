PART II: DEBUNKING MYTHS & MISCONCEPTIONS

#RSAC
Common Myths
· The breach clock starts ticking when I complete my investigation... · We'll have my breach investigation details in a few hours... · I don't need to engage the Board until I discover the breach... · I don't need IR preparation because I have technology... · Third party risk isn't my responsibility...

#RSAC
Misconceptions about communicating during/after a breach are the most egregious.
"WE DON'T NEED?"
...communication templates ...the comms team in tabletop simulations ...to make statements until we have the full details of the breach ...multiple statements for different audiences

PART III: POLLING & WRAP-UP

#RSAC
AUDIENCE POLLING
1. Do you have to disclose an incident if you have clear evidence of data theft? 2. If you suspect data exfiltration has occurred, but don't have definitive evidence
to confirm it, are you obligated to report? 3. Do you think your organization is able to meet the 1-10-60 rule?
(1 min to detect ­ 10 to investigate ­ 1 hr to eject the adversary) 4. If you call the FBI when you've experienced a breach, will they provide
resources to support your remediation? 5. Under GDPR, must I report a breach within 72 hours only where feasible?
