What is Privacy?
Privacy is an interpersonal boundary process by which a person or group regulates interaction with others by altering the degree of openness of the self to others (Altman 1975).
­ Boundary mechanisms are behaviors people use to achieve their desired level of privacy.

"We should attempt to design responsive environments, which permit easy alternation between a state of
separateness and a state of togetherness.
Environments that emphasize only either very little interaction or a great deal of interaction are . . . too static and will not
be responsive to changing privacy needs." (Altman 1975)

#RSAC
A New Era of "Frictionless Sharing"
"People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has evolved over
time." (Zuckerberg 2010)

User Studies on Social Networking Site Privacy

Semi-Structured Interviews: 21 SNS users
­ Asked about how they managed social interactions and resolved conflicts with others in their social networks
Web-based survey: 308 SNS users
­ Recruited participants 18-years-old or older with an active Facebook account
­ Asked to log into their accounts to report privacy behaviors
Privacy Behaviors: The subset of privacy features and/or settings that Facebook users leverage in order to manage privacy boundaries
­ Includes but is not limited to personal disclosure decisions
­ Self-reported privacy settings, frequency of use, or count of behavior

10

#RSAC
Privacy Balancers (36%) -Largest profile -Used common settings -Did not engage with more advanced privacy controls
Privacy Minimalists (22%) -Second largest profile -Often unaware of advanced settings -Exhibited some selfcensorship

#RSAC
Time Savers/Consumers (17%)

Focused more on passive consumption
Minimized distractions by restricting chat availability or altering News Feed
Did some withholding, moderation, and reputation management

" I don't unfriend them but I just cut off their news feed. I hide their status updates from my news feed, and if I am that interested in what she is doing then I'll just go to her
page and check her out." ­Tia, Administrative Assistant, 37

#RSAC
Self-Censor Profile (11%)
These SNS users often mistrusted access level controls to work as expected
As a result, they managed their privacy through self-censorship, which often made them feel socially disconnected from others
"I may show my marriage status, and that's about it. I just don't provide [personal information] through the social network with any more information than I would give a stranger." ­Larry, Software Engineer, 54

#RSAC
Selective Sharer Profile (5%)
Instead of self-censoring, these SNS users shared content with selected groups of people However, with large networks this often became unmanageable

"My wife and I have had to make her father unable to see any of our photos of a niece, since she is black. [Her] dad
is a horrible racist so his knowing about her would negatively affect her
and no one deserves that." ­Allen, Technical Services, 31

#RSAC
Key Implications
Privacy strategies extend beyond disclosure decisions
­ Some privacy settings were leveraged more often than others ­ A spectrum from Privacy Minimalists to Maximizers ­ Self-Censors vs. Selective Sharers
SNS users employ different subsets of privacy features
­ Exhibiting a multidimensional pattern from which emerged unique privacy management strategies
­ Privacy behaviors were often tied to physical groupings within the interface design

#RSAC
Key Implications Continued . . .
Privacy behavior frequency of use provides valuable insights
­ Low use highlights opportunities for privacy redesign and/or user education (i.e. Friend List Management vs. Selective Sharing)
Profiling users offers new opportunities
­ user-centered privacy design, privacy personalization, intelligent userinterface (IUI) design, notifications, recommendations, and nudging
Next Steps
­ Develop a better understanding of antecedents and outcomes associated with various privacy profiles

#RSAC
Applying the Research
Privacy is NOT a binary decision between disclosing and not disclosing information with others
­ Different people manage their privacy in different ways

Users can simultaneously share personal information and have a distinct privacy management strategy
­ It doesn't have to be a zero-sum game

Give users multiple ways to manage both their information privacy and interpersonal boundaries with others

­ Facilitate a personalized experience for different users
