Use Case: Future Remote Health Care
Innovative home health care enabled by advancements in:
­ Health monitoring and therapeutic technologies
­ Remote and Telemedicine ­ Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence ­ Communications, 5G... IoT ­ Other Tech (e.g. healthcare avatars)
Teleoperated Robotics
AI-enabled diagnostics & surgery
Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Emergency Vehicles

Traditional CISO considerations ­ aligning risk to mission

People: those who operate and monitor the service Information: data associated with the service Technology: tools and equipment that automate and support the service Facilities: where the service is performed

!

Assets derive their value from their importance in meeting the service mission.

AI-enabled capabilities, including machine reasoning, is also an asset to be managed

Use case ­ so what will be vulnerable?

Increased connections & access

Autonomous system monitoring & control

Closer IT/OT coupling

#RSAC
Remote execution and control
Machine Learning data & corruptible data stores

Composable tech
Identity management & access controls

Attacks on emergency response

Data protection for Privacy and integrity

Network enabled equipment, remote
management
Safety of life ­ connections, data analytics, explainable AI

#RSAC
What things can we start doing today?
As a CISO:

Design Open, Resilient & Zero Trust Architectures

Master the Supply Chain

Embrace Automation & AI-enabled capabilities

! The CISO will need to become more than just security technologists... they will also need to become business strategists

#RSAC
What things can we start doing today?
For the SOC:

Increase Response Speed

Become more data driven

Balance the SiliconCarbon Ratio

Harness the power of community

! The SOC will need to become more data driven and machine reliant in order to keep pace with threats

The future ­ what we don't know yet and factors that #RSAC we need to watch for

Environmental Evolution
Intelligent Ecosystem Policy & Governance Technologies Ethics . . .

Wisdom Knowledge Information
Data Infrastructure

Adversarial Evolution
Perception Corruption AI-Enabled Exploits Data Corruption Influence . . .

I'm convinced, now what?
Next week you should:
- Take your Chief Data Officer to coffee ­ Focus on data stores, where, what, how used...
- Recognize resilience as a necessary element of lines of business ­ SOC and CISO alignment
- Shift your supply chain thinking to be focused on external dependencies
In the first three to six months following this presentation you should:
· Develop a security model for the technology that supports your DevSecOps efforts
· Begin to catalog your external dependencies
A year from now:
· Have a catalog of your data stores · Know how you are automating reasoning
