A little about us...
Ed Adams, CEO of Security Innovation
­ CEO by day; engineer by trade (and heart) ­ Mechanical Engineer, Software Engineer ­ Distinguished Research Fellow, The Ponemon Institute ­ Privacy by Design Ambassador, Canada ­ In younger days, built non-lethal weapons systems for
Federal Government

#RSAC
Larry's turn...
Founder, The Ponemon Institute
­ Well-known think tank
­ Publishes Research on Security & Privacy
­ Advisory Committee for Online Access and Security for U.S. Federal Trade Commission
­ The White House appointed him to Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee for Department of Homeland Security
­ Two California State task forces on privacy and data security laws
­ Former Cryptographer, Professor, and Navy Communications Officer
­ Super Hero (at least in my mind)

#RSAC
Cars are already part of IoT (Internet of Things)

#RSAC
What enables IoT?
Software runs the world (even hardware)

The Hacker Threat isn't Slowing
Almost half the 89,000 vehicles broken into in London last year were hacked.

Connected Car Positive Benefits & Features
Navigation and Traffic Entertainment Safety Driving support Health and well-being Vehicle condition

#RSAC
Traffic Safety
40,200 US road deaths, and 4,600,000 injuries in 2016 7% increase over 2015. Rising for past 3 years. Fatalities and injuries = $300B/year Congestion = $230B/year Leading cause of death for ages 15-34 in US Driver error accounts for 94% of crashes
Technology Evolution Passive Active Proactive

#RSAC
The Talking Cars Program (aka V2V or V2X)

#RSAC
A Most Promising Solution ­ V2X
· Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication · Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) · Vehicle-to-RSE (road-side equipment) · Vehicle-to-AMD (after-market device) · Vehicle-to- VRU (vulnerable road user)

#RSAC
V2X Sample Use Cases
Intersection Movement Assist Emergency Brake Light notification Forward Collision warning Rain, Ice, Fog and Pothole warnings Do Not Pass warning Eco driving Truck platooning

#RSAC
V2X
"New technology" 10 years in the making
Uses short-range DSRC radio (802.11p)
­ May co-exist with 5G cellular
10 situational messages per second/car
The world's largest PKI infrastructure
o Over 1 Billion certificates per year o Pseudonym Certificates to provide anonymity o Misbehavior reporting to revoke credentials
Privacy and Security are critical success factors
­ Privacy By Design: user-centric approach to systems engineering taking privacy into account at each step

#RSAC
More on Privacy by Design
Will the government be able to track my every move? Will I be issued automatic speeding tickets everywhere? Will I be at even more risk to car hacking? Will terrorists be able to cause mass havoc using V2V?
Privacy by Design addresses these (and more) by:
1. Proactive not reactive 2. Preventative not remedial 3. Privacy as the default setting 4. Privacy embedded into design 5. Full functionality ­ positive-sum, not zero-sum 6. End-to-end security ­ full lifecycle protection 7. Visibility and transparency ­ keep it open 8. Respect for user privacy ­ keep it user-centric

V2X Pilots
Ann Arbor Safety Pilot extended to 30,000 vehicles New York, 10,000 vehicles testing city safety Wyoming, improving I-80 trucking efficiency Many EU and Asia Pacific pilots All major manufacturers engaged Standards set but plenty of room to innovate and add value

Tampa Implementation

#RSAC
Use cases
ü Morning Backups And Congestion ü Wrong-Way Entries ü Pedestrian Safety ü Transit Signal Priority Optimization ü TECO Line Streetcar Conflicts ü Enhanced Signal Coordination

#RSAC
US V2X "Mandate"
US Government planned to make V2X mandatory in 2020
Automakers supportive
o Successful pilots confirm value o Several large OEMs already using V2X
European and Asian activity increasing without mandate
Recent VW announcement will kick-start industry, mandate or not

#RSAC
Government Interest
"Drivers shouldn't have to choose between being connected and being protected"

#RSAC
Government Takes Action
The Security and Privacy in Your Car (Spy) Act
Cybersecurity Standards
· Hacking protection · Data security · Hacking mitigation
Privacy standards
· Transparency · Consumer choice · Marketing prohibition
Cyber dashboard
· A window sticker showing how well the car protects the security and privacy of the owner.

#RSAC
Information Sharing & Access Center

#RSAC
Remaining Challenges
PKI governance and ownership Equipment and infrastructure certification Multi-application operations Standardization Cross-border issues and harmonization of trust Autonomous Vehicle Considerations Sharing with other wireless users of the radiofrequency spectrum Developing and managing data security and addressing public perceptions related to privacy

Final Thoughts
It is still hard to hack cars en masse
Useful parallels to traditional IT
­ Build software systems like buildings and bridges ­ Testing for validation of good behavior (vs. vulnerability discovery) ­ EDUCATE teams on software security and privacy
Car makers are being pro-active
Pilot programs proving value
What can you do?
­ Volunteer for pilot implementations ­ Get involved in local standards organizations ­ Plenty of available jobs in the automotive security world ­ Take a free training course on software security
