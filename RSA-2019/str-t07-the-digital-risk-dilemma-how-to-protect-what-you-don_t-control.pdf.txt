Breadth and depth of risk analytics
­ Scope: number of assets, entities, regions, data types ­ Frequency: rate of scans ­ weekly, daily, real-time ­ Sophistication: risk scoring, alert options, data visualization

#RSAC
Threat alerts are only useful in context.

#RSAC
Preparing your approach
What immediate challenges do we want to solve? Where are our assets and exposures? What do attackers see? What can we integrate or automate to improve our remediation? Internally and externally? How can we leverage threat intelligence in the long-term? What are our expected outcomes in 6 months, 1 year, 3 years?

KeyKteayketaawkaeyasways
1. Assume you lost -- detect and remediate supersede prevent.
2. Threat intel improves your SecOps ­ when it's contextualized
and actionable.
3. Define your use-cases; start with one or two.
4. Get comfortable with grey; strive for risk-based decisions.
