GDPR Lessons

#RSAC
Results Show Steady Stream of Complaints

Consumer Activist Groups Play Key Role Filing Complaints
Complaints come from data rights activist groups, in addition to data subjects, for example:
Complaints have resulted in investigations and enforcement actions:
­ Netherlands DPA issued a report in December 2018, that since the GDPR's enactment, it received 9,661 complaints from data subjects, of which 44% are pending.
­ Irish DPA noted that 4,113 complaints were received and 15 investigations were opened in relation to the compliance of certain technology companies with the GDPR.
­ Survey of German DPAs found that fines were issued in 411.
