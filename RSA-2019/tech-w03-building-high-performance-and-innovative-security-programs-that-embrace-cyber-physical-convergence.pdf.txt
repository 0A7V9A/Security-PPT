Introduction to blockchain

What is blockchain?

Why is this information important?

A blockchain is a database that is distributed, secure, and auditable ­ Distributed means there is no single point of failure in the
network ­ Cryptographically secure ­ Auditable because data is censorship resistant
Public blockchains permit anyone to access, participate in running, and / or build on the blockchain
Private blockchains limit access and participation only to those with permission

Blockchain has applications for many industries e.g., insurance, banking, supply chain, retail, medical services, gaming, charities, entertainment, utilities and the Internet of Things
Smart contracts allow blockchains to execute transactions and transfers automatically, without the need for a central authority
Blockchain is the next step in the evolution of digital communications and business transactions
Creates a new global digital infrastructure
Increases transparency, increases transaction speeds; reduces costs, reduces risks for trade and communications
Streamlines workflows ­ the software automates processes, replacing intermediaries

Scale ­ Imagine How Huge (and Critical) It Will Become!
Hundreds of developers and entrepreneurs around the globe are building Decentralized Applications (DAPPs) using open-source EOSIO block chain software Sectors that benefit from blockchain include everything from music streaming and gaming to legal, email/communications, coding, reference/research, fintech, medical services and more

OLYMPIC GAMES: HISTORIC THREAT ACTORS

2008
BEIJING ­ Ticket Scamming | DDoS
First Olympics to report millions of instances of malicious cyber activity. The majority of this activity was low level and did not affect the games.

2012
LONDON ­ Ticket Scamming | DOS | DDoS
Suffered an internal DOS attack in addition to more generic DDoS attacks and ticket scamming activities.

2016
RIO ­ Ticket Scamming | DDoS | IOC/WADA Data Leak
Hacking and leaking of athletes' medical records, as well as generic DDoS attacks and ticket scamming activities.

Solutions and Recommendations

#RSAC
Lifecycle Plan: Solutions and Recommendations Across a 12 to 24 Month Horizon

Strategy Development and Planning

Understand the scope of the event, program, problem. Divide it

into key program areas: product, devops, GRC, etc. Develop an

01

integrated plan, security architecture, and budget.

02

Government and Regulator Collaboration

Where needed, be sure to understand and leverage existing

solutions for government entities or work with regulatory

03

bodies to ensure alignment.

04

Scale Operational Capabilities

Utilize cloud services and SaaS solutions, and consolidate

security operations where possible. Develop stringent SLAs for all aspects of security operations whether in-house or 3rd

05

party providers.

16

Short Term Partnerships / Long-Term Solutions You start from zero. Leverage a few key partnerships with leading technology and advisory companies utilizing their previous largescale experiences and specialized skillsets. Solve the immediate needs, and develop core competencies. Continue to partner where needed.
SDLC, Continuous Testing and Technical "Rehearsals" Build security into the SDLC and have multiple approaches to testing, including 3rd parties. Perform threat modeling and define security scenarios and conduct technical rehearsals. Use crowdsourced security testing. Define what "done" looks like and conduct operational readiness / tabletop tests.
