How can we bring girls from here ... to ... there ?
The pathway from middle school to a cybersecurity career

A SUCCESS STORY: Emily

#RSAC
Visit from ABC news

#RSAC
Barrier #1 - ENGAGEMENT
Girls don't know about cybersecurity and have never gotten a chance to "try it" - so they don't realize they could enjoy it or that they could be good at it

#RSAC
ENGAGEMENT
- catch them before it's too late by building curiosity and excitement about cybersecurity Middle school
Code.Org
- in school classes and the Hour of Code campaign
Gen Cyber summer camps
- some middle school and girls only camps
After school Clubs
- Girls Who Code, Girl Scouts, CyberPatriot

#RSAC
Barrier #2 - MOTIVATION
Girls are less motivated by: Money - they like it but don't gravitate to careers because of it. Job security - few teenagers are able to process the idea that they won't be able to find jobs doing the work they love.
Girls are very motivated by: Making a difference in the world

#RSAC
Barrier #3 - RECOGNITION
Everyone wants to be a winner - trophies and prizes are fun! But if you never see girls getting a trophy or their picture in the paper, why would you imagine it could be you?
Provide ways for girls to shine and to realize they are good at this. Make the successes very visible with prizes, a reception and their picture in the paper!

#RSAC
Barrier #4 - CONNECTION
Don't see any women role models and don't understand the career track
Solutions:
Speak to a class Help with College selection Buddy up at conferences
Facilitate Internships
Advise on industry certifications

#7 - Value the Entire Life Experience!

"Returning to a career after extended time off? Welcome back -- and welcome to XYZ Org. Whether
you took time off for your family, military service, education, health, or a personal passion project, we value
your entire life experience."

Set aside a small number of job reqs for "returnships" (career re-entry) opportunities.
­ paid internships (often 16 weeks)
­ A great way to tackle well-defined tasks/small programs
Help end bias about returning to work careers.
­ "They won't be as focused."
­ "Their skills will be rusty."
­ "I am taking a risk on them."
Share your experiences about returning workers with others.

Give them a strong start:
­ Keep them engaged ­ Provide strong mentorship ­ Communicate frequently
Understand and own culture issues:
­ TRUST ­ Unconscious bias ­ Equality all around (pay,
expectations, responsibilities)

Adopt and embrace work/life balance:
­ flexible hours ­ flexible work locations
Growth and promotion limitations:
­ Provide training opportunities ­ Encourage advanced degrees ­ Highlight women candidates ­ Provide sponsorship for career
advancement
