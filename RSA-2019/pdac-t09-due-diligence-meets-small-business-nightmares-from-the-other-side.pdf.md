The Landscape
Small businesses are largely not equipped to measure risk Few (if any) dedicated IT staff Cloud-everything Typically outsource large portion of IT function Managed Services Providers (MSPs) often provide most IT services MSPs complicate things (creating further dimensions of risk)

#RSAC
The Landscape
Some of the obstacles with SMBs... Limited ability to validate responses Wildly inconsistent criteria in responses Little/no information on SMBs from rating's firms Lengthy process SMB contract value below `critical' threshold

CASE STUDIES

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDIES: PREFACE All organizations profiled resolved deltas All materially impacted 3rd parties were informed and involved Engagement terms are in their own words The names of the guilty were (are) withheld....
13

Looking from both sides
Case Study #1 ­ Medical Payment Processor

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor 35 person organization Payment processor for medical organizations Custom built web portal and payments app 2 dedicated IT staff 4 dedicated web developers
15

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor "We have achieved high levels of compliance in the industry, including HITECH Act, HIPAA, PCI and Red Flag. This includes PCI-DSS 3.1 SAQ-D and HI-TRUST level 5 compliant (Common Security Framework). In addition to an extensive internal auditing program, the company undergoes further audits by LexisNexis, American Express, MasterCard and Vantiv."
16

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor
17

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor Findings:
­ Compliance was a function of IT ­ High levels of turnover in IT ­ 16 month decline from `optimal' compliance statements ­ Business was focused on improving website features ­ "DevOps can't be slowed down with security" ­ Shoestring budget to fix issues
18

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor Findings:
­ All statements were materially true, at one point... ­ Legitimate remediation efforts underway ­ Responding to 3rd party inquiries as if all certifications were "current" ­ Technical leadership ignorant of what risks were ­ Business leadership was insulated from declining assessment results
19

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #1: Medical Payment Processor Changes Made:
­ Created internal risk reporting matrix ­ Used material areas of PCI and HIPAA as evaluation points ­ Directly tied development roadmap to InfoSec posture ­ IT and DevOps budgets tied to security priorities ­ Forecasted two quarters forward
20

Looking from both sides
Case Study #2 ­ Defense Contractor

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor 45 person organization Specialized manufacturing of defense-related items Subject to ITAR & SCI Extremely high value Information
22

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor Findings:
­ Technology compliance was function of Operations ­ Extremely mature physical controls ­ Intense culture of security; focused on nation state (physical) threats ­ 2 person IT team; mostly focused on Industrial Controls ­ All tactical IT functions outsourced to MSP ­ "Zero failure" culture
23

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor Findings:
­ Internal segregation of information met external requirements ­ MSP used 3rd party for all higher-level technical support ­ MSP had remote access to all non-air gapped systems ­ MSP used foreign nationals for 24x7 support ­ MSP was considered "trusted 3rd party" by subject firm
24

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor Findings:
­ MSP introduced huge security risk ­ MSP introduced total of six previously unknown vendors ­ These vendors were operating / storing data in 5 countries outside the US ­ MSP made no differentiation between their clients' InfoSec requirements ­ No disclosure of outside parties by MSP to subject firm
o The MSP referred to their "NOC Team" and "Monitoring Team"
25

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor Findings:
­ MSP responded to all assessment questionnaires / 3rd party inquires ­ MSP had no consideration of their effect on the information risk
equation ­ MSP conducted no internal ongoing training beyond end-user focused
security awareness ("anti-phishing") ­ "Zero failure" culture of security led to lack of transparency
26

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #2: Defense Contractor Changes Made:
­ Expanded scope of internal InfoSec program to include:
o Clear understanding of End-to-End systems including all 3rd party vendors o "All parties" policy adherence & compliance o Two-party control and approval for firewall changes with external audit
­ Educated executive team to blind spots that led to the "situation" ­ Initiated cultural change from "Zero failure" to "perpetually improving"
27

Looking from both sides
Case Study #3 ­ Financial Analysis Firm

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #3: Financial Analysis Firm 22 person organization Investor Relations portal for Alternative Investment industry Investor-specific Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Not subject to FINRA / SEC compliance
29

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #3: Financial Analysis Firm Findings: ­ Extremely high-value information under their management ­ Subject extremely aware of current InfoSec best-practices ­ Many prominent clients ­ Questionnaire response was "cut-and-paste perfect"
30

#RSAC
Looking from both sides
CASE STUDY #3: Financial Analysis Firm Findings:
­ Passed due-diligence of big names because of relatively low percentage of Assets Under Management (AUM) in `Alternative Investment' portfolio
­ Mile-wide and inch-deep controls ­ Performing at minimum standards ­ "We're a software company, not a data center"

Applying these lessons: Effective tools & techniques
Helping others while helping ourselves

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
COMMONALITIES IN THE SMB SMBs have limited bandwidth to think about security They are focused on only what is required Often ignorant of the intention of controls Overwhelming culture of failure for any "miss"
35

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
COMMONALITIES IN THE SMB The tools that key vendors (MSPs) use are rarely considered Risk stops within their organization
­ Universally no consideration for risk introduced by their vendors
SMB Executives are willing to make changes
36

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #1: Change the conversation INTENTION MOTIVATION ACCOUNTABILITY EDUCATION
37

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #1: Change the conversation Convey both your intention and motivation for requiring specific controls
­ What are you specifically intending to secure, measure, mitigate
Educate: Security is less an "IT" thing, more an executive thing
­ Require a named executive/owner sponsor to be accountable for the assessment
Start from a position of cooperation & mutual benefit
38

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #2: Measure what Matters RELEVANT OBJECTIVE TRANSPARENT FEEDBACK
39

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #2: Measure what Matters Is every SMB vendor subject to the same requirements? Focus inquiry to the most relevant areas of risk Start with broad frameworks Iterative objective measurement cycles
40

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #2: Measure what Matters Risk measurement is likely new to most SMBs Provide transparency in your assessment & results Communicate in business terms on shortcomings
41

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #3: Excellence Awarded BENCHMARK RECOGNIZE REPORT REPEAT
42

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #3: Excellence Awarded SMBs are highly competitive Tie security performance with contract terms (their profit) Peer competition influences change Many enterprises recognize vendors in their supply chain today
43

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #3: Excellence Awarded Recognize objective improvements Create a tiered cybersecurity recognition program Very time-limited recognition
­ E.g. "1H 2018 Small Business Cyber-Security Excellence Award"
A SMB will likely not perform equal to larger businesses
44

#RSAC
Effective Tools & Techniques
Tool #3: Excellence Awarded Communicate your changing landscape & requirements Help them help themselves Answer their questions
­ They likely could never afford access to your cyber/risk resources
45

#RSAC
Attendee Poll
SESSION: PDAC-T09 Do you have a cybersecurity vendor recognition program today?
Yes Not Yet! No I Don't know

Applying these tools
(Operationalizing your SMB cybersecurity initiatives)

#RSAC
APPLYING THESE LESSONS
When you return:
­ Identify if you have demographics information of your vendors ­ What percentage are SMBs? ­ Start the internal conversation of recognition / contract terms for SMBs
Over the next month:
­ Review assessment responses from your SMB vendors ­ Any commonalities? Anything stand out? ­ Identify the core risk areas that your SMB vendors increase exposure
In the next quarter:
­ Create one or more SMB-sized risk assessments ­ Iterative in nature; 10-20 questions max.; Focus on core risk areas.
48

#RSAC
APPLYING THESE LESSONS
Over the next year
­ Establish a cybersecurity recognition program for vendors ­ Educate and equip SMB executives on the use of tool(s) most
appropriate to their business & your need ­ Educate them on their need to assess their MSPs / CSPs ­ Re-assess your SMB vendors using your new iterative assessment
methodology ­ Provide feedback on their assessment scores
o Share how they compare with other similarly sized vendors
