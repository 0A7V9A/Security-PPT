Cybersecurity Product & Vendor Consolidation
78% of CISOs have 16 or more tools in their vendor portfolio 80% of CISOs want to consolidate & have plans for vendor/product consolidation
­ Sometimes sacrificing capabilities; trading for ease of management and orchestration
"For CISOs, CIOs and their teams to be successful, they can't rely on a ton of security products just to function. It simply isn't sustainable."

We Need Openness & Interoperability
What is Openness & Interoperability, and What does it Mean for Cybersecurity, and Digital Trust
31

#RSAC
What is Openness?
Publishing APIs Embracing Ecosystems & Communities Working with overlapping products & solutions Coexisting with others
Security Vendors Cannot Be Islands Anymore!
32

#RSAC
What is Interoperability? E.g., Identity First, PKI & Digital Trust Standards:

EST

SCEP

CSC API

A Call to Digital Trust Market Participants

IAM Providers Need to Work Together

Document Signing and Signatures

Device Manufactures
Certificate Authorities Must Embrace a CA Agnostic Approach

Key, Secret & Certificate Managers Cloud Service Providers

Default to Interoperability
­ By way of standards vs. proprietary agents and methods
Familiarize yourself with Gartner's CSMA Get to know current and emerging standards
­ ACME, CSC API, EST
When renewing or buying new security products ­ Pressure vendors to use open standards ­ Mitigate risk by deemphasizing proprietary
heavy solutions
