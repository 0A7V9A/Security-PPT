Takeaways

#RSAC
Applied what you have learned today

Next week you should:
­ Identify no-code and low-code applications in use in your environment ­ Sort those applications into "contained" and "connected"
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Evaluate the core platform for all no-code and low-code platforms ­ Conduct a risk assessment for each "connected" platforms ­ Use the draft OWASP Top Ten as a guideline
Within six months you should:
­ Develop a policy for your organization on the use of no-code and low-code platforms
­ Continue to research visibility options for "connected" platforms and add these to your observability practice
