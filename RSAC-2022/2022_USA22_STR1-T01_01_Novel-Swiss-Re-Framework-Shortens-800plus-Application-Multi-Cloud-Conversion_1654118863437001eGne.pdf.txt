Introduction & Overview
Swiss Re's Public Cloud Security Journey

#RSAC
Why Multi-Public Cloud Security

80% of organizations will shut down their traditional data centers by 2025.1 96% of organizations are concerned about their current level of cloud security.2 70% of organizations hosting data in the public cloud experienced a security incident, while 66% leave back doors open to attackers through misconfigured cloud services.2 Different clouds are required by regulators in different geographies, e.g. Azure, AWS, GCP in Western countries, Alibaba in China Different clouds may provide commercial or performance enhancements for different applications

#RSAC
Swiss Re's Public Cloud Security Journey
Ambition to be "100% Cloud by 2025" to:
­ Support business growth strategies ­ Enable fast innovation ­ Reduce development time and cost ­ Reduce operating costs ­ Increase security of digital services ­ Increase cyber-resilience of digital services
Timetable could not wait for standards to be developed
Together with BCG we developed and then implemented the Swiss Re Cloud Security Framework (SR-CSF)
Open sourced the SR-CSF through the Cyber Risk Institute - downloadable

Developing The Swiss Re Cloud Security Framework

#RSAC
We started with a granular definition of our cybersecurity and cyber-resilience requirements

Michael Coden

Colin Troha Philipp Krayenbühl

#RSAC
We developed requirements that must be applicable to all CSPs

1. Maintained Cloud agnostic Security Control Objectives

2. Required standardization, consistency, and applicability

across CSPs
3. Increased cybersecurity

Shared Responsibility

4. Increased cyber-resilience

5. Reduced development & SecOps costs

#RSAC
Our Swiss Re Cloud Security Framework achieved
Multi-cloud compatibility and applicability for applications Compliance with industry standards and regulations Efficiencies in audit, risk, and regulatory reporting Increased application and data security and cyber-resilience Reduced development time and cost ­ due to easily reusable security code and procedures
Accelerated time to deployment into production Caused developers to adopt willingly
Reduced operating costs

Michael Coden

10

#RSAC
Our journey faced 3 challenges
1 Developing a common framework that:
­ Meets the needs of all business unit applications & developers ­ Implements consistent compliance and security controls on every CSP ­ Can be audited on every CSP
 Result: Swiss Re Cloud Security Framework (SR-CSF)
2 Developing a process facilitating use of the Swiss Re CSF
­ Educate developers to understand benefits of using the CSF ­ Provide self-service approval for developers who use the CSF ­ Provide governance that developers are using the CSF
 Result: Swiss Re Digital Governance Framework (DGF)
3 Convincing Cloud platform and application developers to embrace

Reusability, compliance, and auditability were critical for acceptance of the SR-CSF and DGF
Security framework for any digital service deployed to any public cloud
Based on CSA/CCM and Cyber Risk Institute "Profile"
Large one-off effort to establish the framework and map global standards and regulations, but then reusable
Provides a strong foundation for secure & compliant implementation, for consistently staying so, and for being able to prove it

Maintain Security and Compliance
Change management Assesses risks of new cloud services and application modifications
Continuous monitoring
Assures applications continue to meet Control Objectives

DGF process, DevSecOps, & HAC

DGF (Digital Governance Framework): New or Changing Digital Services
New or changing cloud services are introduced into the DGF by the case owner, and relevant COs assessed within applicable gates
Ongoing Monitoring
COs that are related to maintenance and monitoring, such policy-based or postdeployment COs, are assessed on an ongoing basis via:
HAC (Cloud Hygiene, Assurance
and Controls)
Developed to continuously monitor digital services wrt security and compliance.

(~$4.8M annual savings for a company with 100 applications)

1. Due to technical automation of checking controls, time spent by audit team in auditing applications was reduced by 3 weeks. 2. ~60% of security controls were able to be automated, reducing the time spent by developers from 2 weeks to 1 week due to the automated configuration. 3. Previously average application approval time was 6-12 weeks depending on the application complexity, and the standardized guardrails reduced this to 2-5 weeks.

Apply
Our lessons learned and how you can apply them to your organization

#RSAC
Key lessons learned
Involve all stakeholders from the beginning of your cloud security process development
Be agile ­ put a project through your process early ­ evaluate, refine and try again
Use existing automations of stakeholders as much as possible ­ it "primes the pump" and gets the community engaged more quickly
