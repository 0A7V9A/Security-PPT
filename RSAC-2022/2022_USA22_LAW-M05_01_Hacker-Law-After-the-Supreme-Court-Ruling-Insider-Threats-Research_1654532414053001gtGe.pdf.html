What the CFAA does
Prohibits--
­ Unauthorized access to a "protected computer" ­ Exceeding authorized access to a protected computer ­ Intentionally damaging a protected computer without
authorization ­ Trafficking in passwords through which a computer
may be accessed without authorization ­ Accessing a protected computer without or in excess
of authorized access to commit fraud ­ An "access" violation is a misdemeanor if it causes
less than $5000 of damage but is otherwise a felony
Criminal and civil penalties

CFAA in context with hacking laws
Federal:
­ Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Sec. 1201 (with exemption!) ­ Wiretap Act/Stored Communications Act ­ Defend Trade Secrets Act ­ Unauthorized disclosure of classified information
State computer crime laws
­ Similar formula to CFAA, but with important differences ­ WA, MO, MD

#RSAC
CFAA ­ used against security researchers?
The CFAA has rarely been used to prosecute security researchers.
"[I]t is important to note that prosecutions against security researchers-qua-security researchers are extremely rare."
Center for Democracy & Technology, "The Cyber:" Hard Questions in the World of Cybersecurity Research (2017)
However, companies sometimes invoke the CFAA companies to discourage research involving their products and security researchers are sometimes investigated for their activities that might implicate the CFAA.

Van Buren
US Supreme Court: Not a CFAA violation to obtain or use information on a computer for impermissible purposes, so long as you are authorized to access the information in the first place.
Van Buren v. United States, 141 s. ct. 1648 (2021).

#RSAC
Van Buren - "Gates up or down?"
CFAA violations do not encompass breach of TOS or contract terms which grant access but limit that access or use based on purpose, intent, or manner of access.
­ Example
But... what establishes "authorization?"
­ Contract/policy-based limits on access? ­ Technological/code-based access limitations?
9

#RSAC
Van Buren ­ Cybersecurity implications
The good news:
­ Clarifies important security research question ­ Settles long-running debate about the CFAA
The bad news:
­ Limits protections against insider threats ­ Restricts use of a statute that protects privacy ­ Leaves important unresolved questions
Reminder:
­ Van Buren is limited to CFAA. Other laws still apply.
10

#RSAC
Applying Van Buren
Organizations may still restrict authorization to access or use a computer through--
­ Technical means, such as password protection or access privileges ­ Data segregation, such as keeping material on separate networks or
protected directories
BUT
When a user is authorized for one purpose, CFAA is a limited deterrent to unauthorized use of information and restrictions on manner of access.
11

#RSAC
Applying Van Buren (cont.)
Examples:
­ Employee accessing unrestricted information on employer computers (and providing it to non-employees).
­ Performing security research on publicly accessible web assets. ­ Using work or school computers for personal purposes.
12

#RSAC
Applying Van Buren (cont.)
Van Buren left some uncertainty:
"For present purposes, we need not address whether this inquiry turns only on technological (or "code-based") limitations on access, or instead also looks to limits contained in contracts or policies."
- Van Buren, fn. 8
While a contract or employment or workplace policy may not be sufficient to revoke authorization standing alone, it may be a factor that is considered with other limitations on access.
13

Van Buren Aftermath
What Van Buren left unexamined
­ "Without authorization"? ­ What are "information located in particular areas of [a] computer--such as files, folders,
or databases--that are off limits"? ­ What is a "gate" and when is a gate "up or down"?
How cases like HiQ might (and might not) provide additional guidance on security research practices
Other security research practices that might be charged as offenses
Federal legislation?
­ International Cybercrime Prevention Act
State computer crime laws

#RSAC
Van Buren Aftermath
Revised DOJ guidance on the CFAA!
­ "The attorney for the government should decline prosecution if the defendant's conduct consisted of, and the defendant intended, good-faith security research."
­ "'[G]ood faith security research' means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability,
where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services."
