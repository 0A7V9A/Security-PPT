Sizing Up Human Risk

#RSAC
Investigating the human attack surface

Of all data breaches examined in a recent Verizon DBIR:

30% of breaches involve internal threat actors

8% of breaches involve misuse actions

20% of breaches involve human error

22% phishing and other social engineering tactics

29% of breaches target humans as a compromised asset 40% of malware breaches employ password dumpers

Thanks to the DBIR team for providing these stats!

37% of malware breaches prompted users to click email links

13% of malware breaches prompted users to execute attachments

80% of hacking involves brute force or lost/stolen credentials

Investigating the human attack surface
Observable forms of human risk played a direct role in 61% of the largest cyber incidents of the last 5 years. Even more daunting is the fact that these human risk factors racked up a price tag of $15 billion--that's 88% of the total losses!

Investigating the human attack surface
Insiders are vectors more often than they're villains. But we need to recognize and respond to signs of both to
manage the whole of human risk.

Combinations of risky behaviors
A user is "high risk" if they are in the top 75th percentile of users in their organization that have any events.

#RSAC
Where do we focus interventions?
9% of users are high risk in one category 0.6% of users are high risk in two categories 0.05% of users are high risk in three categories

Lessons in Managing Human Risk
20

#RSAC
Signals of human risk are complex and intercorrelated

#RSAC
Training doesn't solve human risk
24

#RSAC
Groups are harder to manage than individuals
25

#RSAC
Benchmarking is better than a briefing
26

#RSAC
Benchmarking is better than a briefing
More broadly, this hints that strategies like benchmarking and proactive actions may hold greater promise for reducing human
risk than mandatory or punitive interventions.

Summary Of Key Findings
On average, 3% of employee exhibit 2 or more risky behaviors likely to introduce incidents 15.6% of users will click through one phishing email per year. 1% will click more than 12 a year (~ ONCE A MONTH) 18% of employee have riskier browsing habits than the average employee Too much security training (3+) and simulated phishing (11+) can be counter-productive. First-line managers are most likely to introduce malware than any other leadership role.
32

#RSAC
Applying These Findings
Not everyone is the same when it comes to making security decisions. One-size-fits all policies are too restrictive for some and not enough for others. Pinpointing helps focus our mitigation efforts on areas we have most impact. Use insights to work with employees instead of against to help them improve. Iteration, not perfection. You will always have employee who make mistakes. Focus on highest 3% of risky users. Iterate.
