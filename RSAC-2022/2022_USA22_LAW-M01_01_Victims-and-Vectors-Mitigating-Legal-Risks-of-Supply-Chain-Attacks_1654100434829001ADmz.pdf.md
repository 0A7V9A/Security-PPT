Threat Landscape - Vectors of Attack
· Supply chain attacks are becoming more common and are showing up in new and unexpected ways - Compromising legitimate software through automatic updates: NotPetya, SolarWinds - Compromising cloud infrastructure providers: Okta compromise by Lapsus$ - Compromising managed service providers: Kaseya compromised by REvil - Vulnerabilities in software components: log4j, Spring framework - Business email compromise of vendors
· Digital transformation is expanding the size and scope of the supply chain, increasing the threat surface
· Ransomware continues to evolve and is increasingly seen in human-operated attacks focused on enterprise networks, with the addition of data theft to the classic encryption scenario
· Nation state tensions increase risks of cyber intrusions · Increased connectivity expands the attack surface available to bad actors
