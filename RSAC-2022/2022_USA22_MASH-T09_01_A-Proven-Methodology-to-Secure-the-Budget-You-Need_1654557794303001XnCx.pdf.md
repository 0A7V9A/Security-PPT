1. The Problem
Why Securing Budget is Difficult

#RSAC
Your Budget Situation
Raise Your Hand if ...
You have 100% of the budget you truly need to get your job done right? You have 100% of the staff you truly need to get your job done right? Today we will talk about:
­ Why does this problem occur? ­ How does this problem manifest itself? ­ How you can all raise your hand the next time you are asked if you have 100% of
the budget or staff you need.

#RSAC
Two Parts that Factor into Securing a Budget

Trust: In how we have managed security in the past
Confidence: In the information presented in the present to reach a quality decision

Budget Request

Trust: In how we have managed security in the past

Present
Confidence: In the information presented in the present to reach a quality decision

#RSAC
Establishing Trust and Confidence
If you asked your Leadership Team these four questions, how would they respond?
1. Risk Management: Do we have a "clear line" to definitively know if a Risk is "okay" to accept, or "not okay" to accept and we need to remediate it?
2. Communication: When discussing risks, are InfoSec and Senior Leadership speaking the same or different languages?
3. Legal Protection: Are we in a legally defensible position? 4. Budgeting: Are we spending the right amount?
7

#RSAC
Establishing Trust and Confidence
We surveyed 140 CEOs and CFOs1. Of the C-level respondents: 65% DO NOT understand when it is "okay" to accept a risk 85% DO NOT understand what InfoSec is saying 96% DO NOT know if they are in a legally defensible position 97% DO NOT know if they are spending the right amount on Security
C-Level executives do not have the information they need to approve budgets!

#RSAC
So, What Happens When C-Level Does Not Have the Information They Need to Approve
They approve as little budget as they feel they must! That is why the InfoSec function is so frequently under-resourced!

#RSAC
2. The Solution
Documented Trust & Confidence

#RSAC
Solution ­ Documented Trust and Confidence
Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) is the solution for creating a common
language between InfoSec and Business!
DoCRA is based on the legal concept of "Due Care." This means, we must protect
others from the harm we may cause them by implementing controls that are not more burdensome to us than the risk of the harm to others.
Due Care is the level of care that the legal system expects an organization to
perform.
13

#RSAC
Solution ­ Documented Trust and Confidence

The DoCRA Risk Assessment methodology answers the four questions allowing C-Level need to make informed budgeting decisions:
1. A clear "line" / risk acceptance criteria to evaluate whether to "accept" the risk or "invest" in mitigation
2. Common language between InfoSec and business / regulators / legal system 3. Legally defensible position by defining what is legally "reasonable" 4. Risk Management process to know you are spending the right amount

14

#RSAC
How does DoCRA create a Common Language?

DoCRA fills in the missing components to create a common language as a universal translator.

About DoCRA
The Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) methodology was launched as a standard in early 2018 DoCRA is a non-profit organization DoCRA donated a version of its Risk Assessment Methodology to CIS® (Center for Internet Security) CIS published this Risk Assessment Method 2.1 (CIS RAM), containing DoCRA, with the CIS Controls Version 8 DoCRA can be utilized with CIS, NIST, ISO or any control set
16

#RSAC
About DoCRA (Continued)
DoCRA has had significant adoption Over 50,000 downloads of the CIS RAM 1.0 and over 10,000 downloads of CIS RAM 2.1 Methodology Used by state Attorneys General to determine whether controls were legally "reasonable" during a breach Utilized by federal regulators to develop post-breach corrective action plans (injunctive relief)

Does the Narrative and How We Provide Information to Budget Approvers Really Matter?
Do you know what the movies Rocky, Star Wars, The Matrix, Spider Man, The Lion King, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and countless other hits have in common?

These Blockbuster Movies follow a proven narrative called "The Hero's Journey"
Your Budget Requests should also follow a proven narrative, that provides decision makers the information they need to make a quality decision.

#RSAC
Traditional Approach ­ DLP Budget Request
CISO: "We need a DLP product to catch personal information for claims data that might be leaving the company through email, FTP, web app file shares, or other means."
CISO: "I recommend this $250,000 solution that solves this burning issue and gets us everything we need."
CFO: "That's a quarter of your budget. Is there a more affordable option or could we implement just a portion of it?"
CISO: "The entry level, bare-bones solution from this vendor is $50,000, but it will not eliminate all of our risk."
CFO: "Let's start with approving $50,000 this year and re-evaluate next year."

What This Project Accomplishes

PII Leaving Perimeter. Utilizing a $180 cost per lost PII record (IBM Security & Ponemon Institute Report), we calculate a breach cost of $1,800,000 ($180 x 10,000 records) with a potential likelihood of (5) multiple time each year.
The risk has a potential impact of $1,8000,000 multiple times per year

Proven Budget Narrative Approach

Does Management have information to answer the 4 questions?

1. Risk Management: "clear line" to know if a Risk "is okay" to accept? Yes, must remediate

2. Communication: Speaking the same or different languages? Yes, impacts in business terms

3. Legal Protection: Legally protected? Yes, we're performing "due care"

4. Budgeting: Spending the right amount? Yes, spending $280,000 first year to avoid $1.8M
potential impact multiple times each year
