The Acceleration of MSSP and Cloud Adoption
Work from home and the "Great Resignation" helped accelerate the adoption of managed security services providers (MSSPs)
­ Market growth was already increasing due to increasing regulations, rising security breaches, and the already tight cybersecurity talent pool
­ The global MSS market size is projected to grow from USD 22.8 billion in 2021 to USD 43.7 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 13.9%

#RSAC
The Acceleration of MSSP and Cloud Adoption
In some organizations the rush to address these challenges with MSSPs came at the expense of resourcing/risk in other areas In many cases we saw organizations overcompensating with new tools and services in the areas of Detection and Response at the expense of their Identification, Prevention, and Recovery strategies

#RSAC
Does this sound familiar? How do you fix it?
A full, programmatic gap assessment can help to recognize and correct the imbalance and guide not only the redistribution of resources, but also your MSSP strategy going forward This type of assessment can help identify under-resourced areas and provide a roadmap for targeted moves to rebalance and reduce risk With the help of the right MSSP partners, you may be able to better consolidate and coordinate services and achieve additional risk reduction
5

#RSAC
Where do you start?
Start with an assessment of your requirements
­ Areas that have clearly been neglected ­ Areas currently under-resourced with too much risk ­ Areas where there is a clear skills gap ­ Areas where you may have overlap in existing tools or services ­ Areas where it may not be feasible or advisable to resource internally
Consider using a security framework to guide your review Compare the findings to your deployment of tools and MSSP services

Case Study ­ The Background
We had a client last year: Mid-size organization with a mature security program aligned to NIST CSF In 2020 & 2021, IT and Security made rapid priority shifts because WFH, and later staff turnover Security Shifts included:
­ Moving some security functions to the cloud ­ Shifting staff to reinforce Detection and Response capabilities ­ Contracting a SIEMaaS to help supplement the staff ­ Pursuing another narrowly-focused MSSP to implement and manage new
EPP/EDR
Lost focus on the increased risk in other areas of their program
10

#RSAC
Case Study ­ The Assessment & Findings

Assessment revealed obvious gaps in the program, calling

attention to the risks in: Identify Protect

Recover

Highlighted internal skill gaps in these areas requiring either additional staff, training, or more professional services

Identified the probability of exacerbating the problem with their plans to bring in another narrowly-focused MSSP to "improve" EPP/EDR

11

#RSAC
Case Study ­ The Way Forward
Engaged us to bolster those areas where they had the most risk, and to continue to help execute improvements across the board We helped them develop a staffing and MSSP strategy that included supporting the weaker areas while also bringing SIEM and MDR under the same full-spectrum MSSP umbrella Showed how they could do this without creating further turmoil and expense associated with replacing their EPP/EDR

Keys to their Success
Assessment of risk and controls Additional consideration of internal and external (MSSPs) resourcing Engaging a full-spectrum MSSP who:
­ Consolidated and improved Detection and Respond capabilities, without replacing existing EPP/EDR tools
­ Had a broad portfolio of services to also help in the areas of Identification, Prevention, and Recovery planning
­ Had a deep bench of analyst, engineers, and a strategic tier of principal consultants with years of experience leading and orchestrating security programs
