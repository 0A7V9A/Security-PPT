What Are the Key Challenges
· What should a national ICT supply chain security strategy look like?
­ What should it call for, and how can it be implemented successfully across the
government and private industry?
­ Should it include a call for an industrial strategy?
· Does industrial strategy actually work--especially past the R&D phase?
­ What should the government steer toward and away from when crafting an
effective innovation policy?
­ Where does the United States still have a competitive technological advantage--
and where does it not?
· What are the challenges involved in collaborating with allies?
­ What can the United States do with allies, and where does it need to go it alone? ­ Is the United States just paying lip service to allies by claiming we want to work
together while pushing for reshoring and "Made in America"?
