Security in an increasingly connected world

The number of IoT connections is forecast to reach 24 billion by 2025 (Source: GSMA)*

· As more and more user data and critical information is shared by connected objects, security becomes vital to protect assets, IP, privacy, users, businesses and brands.
· However, innovation has outpaced security and privacy across the IoT landscape.
· Many manufacturers have adopted a `connect first, think later' strategy, where security has been an afterthought.

The global IoT market could be
worth $900 billion in revenue
by 2025**.

Understanding IoT security

The challenge Insecure objects are an easy target for:

Physical or proximity attacks on a SINGLE
device

Remote attacks from the cloud to MANY
devices

· Manufacturers of traditionally offline products have not previously had to consider the digital security and privacy implications of their products.

· This has resulted in a significant knowledge and capability gap.

· When security and privacy `by-design' is neglected, endusers and actors in the connected value chain are left vulnerable.

Increasing IoT regulations, frameworks and guidance

Interventions from regulators tend to focus on recommendations across several key areas:

Trusted connectivity

Device security

Protection of assets

Momentum for eSIM continues to build

TCA members report
337 million
eSIM shipments for 2021.
9% Year-on-Year increase (YoY)

TCA members reported 38% growth in M2M eSIM shipments, driven by uptake across automotive and IoT verticals.

IoT SAFE

IoT Backend

To further extend the capability of the SIM, GSMA and TCA have partnered on
IoT SAFE (IoT SIM Applet For Secure End-2-End Communication).
· Specifies a common API and defining a standardised way to leverage the SIM to securely perform mutual authentication between IoT device applications and the cloud.
· Ensures maximum robustness of the mutual authentication, due to all critical security functions being executed in the SIM.
· Removes the IoT device and SIM applet fragmentation barrier by specifying a common "IoT device to IoT security applet" API.

Expanding the benefits of eSIM
Ensuring eSIM interoperability and expanding the benefits of the technology to emerging IoT market segments are key objectives for TCA.

TCA has various working groups that work in close collaboration with GSMA, and are dedicated to optimising the eSIM for use in IoT and to also position it as a Root of Trust for protection of IoT data:

eSIM Working Group
Develops and manages the eSIM
Profile Package Specification.

IoT Security Application
Works to extend the security capabilities of the SIM to overcome
IoT market fragmentation.

RSP for IoT
Guides and supports the development of
eSIM-related specifications, to address eSIM market evolution and the needs of the IoT.

SAM
Guides development of GSMA SAM-related
specifications, addressing TRE market convergence.

Market forces driving the integration trend

In recent years, market forces have promoted the integration of SIM functionality on a System on a Chip (SoC).
This has created increasing demand for the integrated SIM.

Device miniaturisation Digitalisation 5G

Sustainability
17

Integrated SIM

What?
SIM functionality implemented on a hardware TRE integrated within a host SoC.
Delivers equal levels of security assurance already associated with other SIM form factors.
Self-contained from a security perspective and does not rely on any protection mechanisms of the host SoC.

Why?
Need for global interoperability and security assurance levels.
Avoid market fragmentation risk, reduce product development costs and potential for premature obsolescence.
Technical advantages ­ e.g. optimised power consumption to increase battery life.

#RSAC
How?
Global efforts to standardise nascent integrated SIM technology.
Specifications and definitions for the TREs enabling SIM functionality.
Integrated SIM solutions which align with open standards can now be recognised for their high levels of security assurance and global interoperability.

Harnessing the potential of integrated SIM

Utilities
Connectivity for smart meters requires reliable, robust security and long battery life.
An integrated SIM offers significant power-saving benefits over its predecessors.
Integrated SIM also provides further assurances to utility companies that it cannot be removed or swapped to misreport the amount of utility
consumed.
.

Logistics
Increasing requirement for real-time information to support logistics at all levels.
Devices enabled with integrated SIM functionality can be leveraged for near real-time monitoring, using Low Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) connectivity.
Allows suppliers to track large and take immediate corrective action if needed.

Consumer Devices
Fitness and health wearables have become hugely popular.
However limited battery life is a pain point for wearable users, and many have to charge daily.
Integrated SIM technology helps to optimise the device real-estate and reduces the power budget of wearable significantly.
