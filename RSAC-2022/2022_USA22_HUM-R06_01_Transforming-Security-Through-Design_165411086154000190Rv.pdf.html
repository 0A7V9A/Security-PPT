90%
of breaches are caused by people
(not an actual statistic)

#RSAC
Most industrial accidents are caused by human error. Estimates
range from 75 to 95%.
How is it that so many people are incompetent?

" Answer: They aren't. It's a design problem. -- Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

A Design Approach

The Model (Usability) Paths They Take

#RSAC
Number of steps Familiarity of each step
Friction at each step

Choices They Make

Number of choices Predictability of each choice Cognitive load for each choice

#RSAC
Usability
Behavior or journey maps Control Frameworks (CSC) Reduce steps Reduce choices Simplify Clarify

#RSAC
Security depends upon how well the needs of people are met by the affordances of the security controls. If they don't meet, people will creatively satisfy their own needs with their own affordances.

#RSAC
Constrained users are creative, and creative users are dangerous.

Feedback

#RSAC
" Nudge was written as an alternative to rules and mandates. -- Richard Thaler

#RSAC

Nudge

Sludge
18

#RSAC
" Sludge: friction and bad intentions. -- Richard Thaler
19

#RSAC
Look at the paths they take
Process analysis Journey mapping Behavior mapping Wayfinding
20

#RSAC
No. Really look.
Expected path: IT operations Exception handling: Security Is it the path? Choices? What can be learned?
21

#RSAC
Bad friction along the path encourages users to bypass or avoid security.
22

#RSAC
23

#RSAC
24

#RSAC
Good friction is the natural consequence of poor security behaviors.
25

#RSAC

#RSAC
Problem: our typical metrics

"What percentage of the organization's identified vulnerabilities have not been remediated in a timely manner?"
"What percentage of the organization's hardware assets have not recently been scanned to identify unauthorized network boundaries?"
"What percentage of the organization's network devices are not located on dedicated Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)?"
"What percentage of the organization's accounts are not included in the organization's inventory?"

Measuring Tool: HEART

#RSAC
Metrics
Measure compliance rates, BUT ALSO Measure process and communication sludge

#RSAC
Exception Handling

#RSAC
Again, look at the paths they take
Why do users follow the path? When do they forge their own? Expected path: IT operations Exception handling: Security
32

#RSAC
People breaking the rules are people communicating to us our design problems.

Security Champion
A security champion is a member of the business itself, who collaborates with the security team on best practices.
· Share and contextualize security knowledge · Plan to turn action to behavior · Provide peer support

#RSAC
Security Advocate
A security advocate is a member of the security team who focuses on getting practices into the hands of the workforce.
· Share and contextualize business knowledge · Fight sludge and security fatigue · Connect champions to wider community

#RSAC
Advocate/champion programs are for making informed decisions, not simply carrying out
things already decided.

Defend

#RSAC

Usability

Defensibility

Manageability

Auditability

#RSAC
Fifth Ability: Marketability (out of scope)
Business case What does the capability enable? What does the capability prevent? How easier will it be to run? How compliant will it make us?
45

The Model (Defensibility) Paths They Take

#RSAC
Number of steps Familiarity of each step
Friction at each step

Choices They Make

Number of choices Predictability of each choice Cognitive load for each choice

#RSAC
Defensibility
Threat model or attack path Mitre ATT&CK Increase steps Increase choices Complicate Confound
47

#RSAC
Good security gets out of the way of users while getting in the way of adversaries.
48

#RSAC

#RSAC
Final Thoughts

#RSAC
Roadmap depends on where we are
Before: using this design approach for security architecture and planning During: using this design approach as part of an active security initiative (example: building an IAM program) After: using this design approach to troubleshoot and address security problems in an ongoing business area (example: securing DevOps)
51

#RSAC
Introducing design into security programs
Next week you should:
­ Identify an area that would benefit from a human-centric design approach
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Map out the processes (usability) ­ Map out the attack paths (defensibility) ­ Evaluate controls and establish metrics
Within six months you should:
­ Map out manageability and audit ­ Implement the controls and establish feedback ­ Tune the controls and policy to reduce impact on users while increase impact on
adversaries
