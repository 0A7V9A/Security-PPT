CCPA-How Did We Get Here? Private Right of Action and Cyber Security Importance Cyber Security Data Breach and Privacy Litigation Recent CCPA Cases Privilege Under Scrutiny Recent Caselaw Other States: CPRA (CA), CO, VA, UT, CT SEC Cyber Security Proposed Reporting Rule Presidential Orders Other federal movements

#RSAC
CCPA-How Did We Get Here?
The CCPA changed the entire privacy landscape in the U.S. Granted California "consumers" certain rights over their personal information
­ Right to access, delete and opt out of sale
Requires businesses subject to the law to disclose specified, detailed content in the business's privacy policies Provides certain benefits to businesses that contractually restrict the activities of service providers that process personal information Mandates specific CCPA training of relevant personnel Compliance deadline was January 1, 2020, enforcement July 1, 2020. Private right of action for data breaches

#RSAC
CCPA Private Right of Action
CCPA gives consumers a private right of action when their "nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information" is "subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business's violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures."
­ Unlike most data breach and privacy laws ­ No proof of actual harm ­ Statutory damages allowed

#RSAC
CCPA Cyber Security Requirements
As a result of the business's violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information
­ CIS 20 (California's 2016 Data Breach Report) ­ NIST Cybersecurity Framework

#RSAC
Notable CCPA Cases
Gardiner v. Walmart, 2021 WL 4992539 (N.D. Cal. July 28, 2021) (no CCPA retroactivity, failure to meet statutory requirements for PII)
Hayden v. TRE, (C.D. Cal. May, 2022) (no CCPA retroactivity; private right of action limited to data breach),

#RSAC
Privilege Under Scrutiny
Motivation of the investigation Was the report prepared in anticipation of litigation or would it have been done as part of normal business operations? Pre-existing relationship with investigator Courts have found against work-product privilege where Defendant had a pre-existing relationship with investigator. Hiring a new/separate investigator may weigh in favor of work-product privilege. Recipients of report Sharing report with non-legal personnel weighs against privilege. Sensitivity of business In determining whether an investigation was done for purely litigation purposes, courts have considered the sensitivity of the defendant's business. If security is a key business concern, Defendants may be likely to conduct investigation, regardless of litigation threat. This weighs against work-product privilege. Characterization of expenses Was investigation characterized as a legal or business (non-legal) expense?

#RSAC
Notable Cases ­ Disclosure Ordered
In re Polaris, Inc., 967 N.W.2d 397, 410-11 (D. Minn. 2021) - "primary purpose" of investigation was not legal advice where report provided recommendations on corporate policy addressed regulatory concerns In re Rutter's Data Security Breach Litig., 2021 WL 3733137, at *3 (M.D. Pa.

Clark Hill, PLC, 338 F.R.D. 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2021) ­ Defendant likely would have investigated security breach regardless of threat of litigation and report was used for non-legal purposes and shared with non-legal team
