Today's SC Risk Information Sharing Models
Law: Cybersecurity & Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015):
· Some private sector liability protection for sharing certain "cyber threat" information
Public-Private Forums:
· ISACs, ISAOs, DHS Sector Coordinating Councils, Homeland Security Information Network, FBI Infragard, State Fusion Centers; Federal Acquisition Security Council ("Voluntary Information Submission)
US DHS Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
· Threat Information Sharing Framework · National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) · Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) · Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP)

Information Sharing Work Group - Year 1
Mapping Exercise: Mapped Information available to SC Threats
Conclusion: Highest value information = exchange of supplier-specific risk creating information
Information Source Analysis
Conclusion: Suspect supplier information discovery--Earlier by industry, later by government
Impediment Analysis
Conclusion: Sharing is hampered by legal concerns, namely the prospect of facing a private cause of action, most likely brought by the supplier about whom the concerns were raised
13

#RSAC
Information Sharing Work Group - Year 2
Identify the Legal Impediments to Increased Information Sharing of SC Risk · Categories of Claims
· Tortious Interference with Existing Contract · Tortious Interference with Prospective Contract, Business Relationship or Business Advantage · Defamation · Business or Commercial Disparagement · Fraudulent Misrepresentation · Breach of Contract · Misappropriation of Trade Secrets
· Mapping of key considerations for litigation risk for each Category of Claim · Potential approaches to  beneficial sharing while  litigation risk:
· Education/outreach promoting > sharing of SCR information + liability risk reducing precautions · Ask for the relevant information through an existing government body · Longer-term changes in law

The Elephant in the Room: Naming Risk Actors

Sharing the Most Valuable Information - Risky SC Actors/Activity Liability for Identifying Risky SC Actors/Activity

High-level factors that move the reporting company along the spectrum of litigation risk:

Intent to serve the public interest

vs.

Good faith belief in the veracity of the concern reported vs.

Degree of care in vetting the credibility of facts reported vs.

intent to harm the reported supplier or gain private benefit spurious maligning of reported supplier careless innuendo and sharing rumors

Conclusion:
Private Litigation Risk Spectrum

15

#RSAC
Private Litigation Risk Spectrum

Type of concern

Criminal activity (e.g., Suspected criminal espionage, sabotage) activity

Unethical business practices

Insecure hardware, software

Poor quality hardware, software

Level of certainty

Facts confirmed with Facts, sources heavily Facts credible, prelim.

documentary evidence vetted, credible

investigated

Facts credible but not investigated

Unconfirmed rumor

Formality of reporting

Filing under a statutory regime or similar model

Audience of the

reported concern, relationships

Contractual relationship, required reporting

between parties

Government's role

Formal proceeding or government contract, required reporting

Message reported Anonymized

Low: Suit would be dismissed

Signed statement also filed with LE/govt

Signed statement to one or more private parties

Group for sharing Minimal commercial

criminal or safety

interest between

supply chain concerns reporting party and

(inc. with LE/govt) recipient

Formal program with procedural steps for reporting

Express interest in private reporting

Only name the

Use euphemisms for

country of concern the supplier

Medium: Suit could survive motion to dismiss, reach discovery

Oral report to one or "Whisper more private parties campaign"

Reporting party seeks business with recipient, is competitor with reported supplier

Reporting company has contractual relationship with reported supplier

Implied interest in private reporting

No interest in private reporting

Identify a class of companies

"Do not buy from this company!"

High: Suit could prevail

Information Sharing Work Group - Year 2.5
Final Goal
Identify Paths to: · Ensure omni-directional information sharing re: risky SC actors · Protect sharing enterprises from liability for doing so

#RSAC
Information Sharing: How to Do It Right!
Amend CISA 2015 to include: · supply chain risk as a Cyber Threat Indicator · a definition of supply chain risk that includes data & information · preemption over conflicting state/federal laws · exemption from possible antitrust violation · segregation + exclusion of information extraneous to Supply Chain Risk
