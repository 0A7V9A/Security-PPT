Supplier Risk Hype
Ransomware attack disrupts Toronto's public transportation system

#RSAC

#RSAC
Current State
1000's of suppliers Several 100's of questions in SIG, SIGlite and commercial "Exchanges"
Scorecard services Compliance frameworks reinforce the questions
Supplier Risk team resources Parts of the risk assessment process performed in isolation

Warnings about change

Password Policy was WRONG for a very
long time

· 8 characters · Special, upper/lower, numbers · Lockout after 3 attempts · Change every 60 days · Etc

Controls deployed because of compliance frameworks

· What control worked its way into PCI-DSS in 20xx and still lives as a result?
· Point solutions: Database Access Monitoring, Web App Firewalls

Warnings about change
Let's not make the same mistakes

#RSAC
Change our mindset
What do we really want from our suppliers?

#RSAC
Change our mindset
How can we get out of our own way
to do this better?

#RSAC
Change our Mindset: What do we really want from our Suppliers?
1. Sustain their services to our organization! 2. Don't let our data get breached!
And what this really means is we don't want them to get ransomed and extorted. If we can focus on this central idea, we can free ourselves from many, many weak habits.

#RSAC
Evolve our Mindset: Compliance  Threat

"Compliance-driven"
 ITGC's & Audit playbook  Assets, Identity, Business Continuity  Identify, Prevent, Restore mindset

"Threat-driven"
 Blue & Red playbook  Ransomware resilience  Detect & Respond mindset

Thirty Questions
The principles of our 30 Questions activity are to:
1. Increase speed and focus. Security cannot be a bottleneck. We want to respond with a fast but thoughtful recommendation to our business partners when they are looking at a new supplier. We also want to be able to go back and effectively assess a larger number of our existing suppliers.

#RSAC
Thirty Questions
The principles of our 30 Questions activity are to:
2. Only ask meaningful questions. We will only ask consequential questions where a negative outcome substantially increases our risk. We are focused on the ability to detect and respond to intrusions, prevent and restore from ransomware attacks, and sustain production services.
Through this approach, we hope to...

#RSAC
Thirty Questions
The principles of our 30 Questions activity are to:
3. ...Help these partners. Many of them are less sophisticated in cybersecurity, and we want to help them avoid being breached or ransomed for their sake and ours

#RSAC
Thirty Questions
Throwing out the old playbook meant starting from scratch We thought about what mattered most to thwart adversaries We added the right level of detail to the questions We considered what can be evidenced vs. just stated We went back to NIST and ISO to make sure nothing essential was missing The CISO can modify and approves these questions

#RSAC

#RSAC
Examples
Do privileged users have separate administrator and user accounts?
Yes, your supplier is more likely to get infected by malware and ransomed if they don't do this.

#RSAC
Examples
Do you terminate access for employees and contractors within
24 hours of their departure?
Your supplier won't get ransomed because of this.

#RSAC
Examples

Do you use multi-factor authentication on

Better: all Internet-facing services?
Do you use multi-factor authentication on all Internet-facing services including:

 Email  VPN/VDI  Cloud Environments  SaaS Applications

 Remote support tools  File transfer  Websites  None of the above

#RSAC
The Game: Thirty Worthy?

#RSAC
Thirty Worthy Themes
Question Hints ­ If the answer is No, the supplier would already be out of business ­ The question doesn't translate to enough ransomware or data breach risk ­ We know they will answer Yes but we don't believe them ­ We care a lot about how they harden and test network and endpoint visibility ­ We care a lot about how they practice incident readiness

#RSAC
Do you perform 24x7x365 continuous security monitoring and response:  In-house  Outsourced  Co-Managed  None of the Above If 2 or 3, who is the provider?

#RSAC
Do you use industry standard data center physical access controls?

#RSAC
Do you use a CMDB to maintain asset information including criticality levels?

#RSAC
Do you test a documented Incident Response Plan in a tabletop exercise at least annually?

#RSAC
Do you use firewalls to filter inbound traffic to your network?

#RSAC
Do you regularly audit your firewalls configurations and rules?

#RSAC
What is the patching goal for your emergency vulnerability process?  < 48 Hours  < 7 Days  < 14 Days  < 30 Days  None of the above

#RSAC
Do you have cloud security configuration monitoring enabled (GuardDuty, Azure Security Center, or third-party tool)?

#RSAC
Does your password policy require the following (Select all that apply)  8-12 characters  Complexity and numbers  Changes per NIST guidance  3-5 attempt lockout  5 password history

#RSAC
Do you require all users to have unique user accounts with complex passwords which must be changed on first use?

#RSAC
Do all employees and contractors receive annual security awareness training?

#RSAC
Do you use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to monitor storage and transfer of our data?

#RSAC
Which of your backup solution's recommended hardening capabilities do you use to protect your backups?
 Snapshots  Immutable Snap Locks  Air Gap  Use of Local Accounts  MFA for admin access to the console  Other  None of the above

#RSAC
Do you conduct annual tests of restoration from backup capabilities for systems supporting services to our organization?

#RSAC
Please attach your independent SOC2 report, not older than 12 months.

#RSAC
Have you documented the authorized locations and users and flows of our data in your network in a data flow map?

#RSAC
Will you notify us within 24 hours of a breach or compromise involving our data?

#RSAC
Intermission & Case of Study: Simplifying TPRA
Using Standard Information Gathering (SIG) Lite. ~330 questions Average time to execute each assessment was 113 days! Security breaches continue to happen out there A new, more practical approach was required to effectively assess our vendors We re-defined our approach to TPRA, including related questionnaires We also asked for help Our current TPRA questionnaire includes less than 40 questions Average time to execute each assessment is now 18 days Our TPRA process will be working as a `system' where the questionnaire is connected to other elements of the process Our Legal department and key stakeholders welcomed and support this approach

#RSAC
Do you have a "report phishing" button that any employee can use to trigger investigation by your 24x7 CyberSOC?

#RSAC
Do you have a documented Secure Systems Development Lifecycle Policy (SDLC) that governs how security is built into your application(s)?

 Microsoft Defender ATP  Crowdstrike  Elastic  SentinelOne
 Other

 BlackBerry Cylance  CarbonBlack  FireEye  None of the Above

#RSAC

#RSAC
Do you have a privacy policy and are you compliant with CCPA?

#RSAC
Do you use industry standard data center environmental controls?

#RSAC
Does your Incident Response Plan and tabletop exercise describe specific ransomware response procedures?

#RSAC
Do you use secure file transfer methods to share our data with authorized third parties?

#RSAC
Challenges
Your team members will resist this approach
We need to increase the skill of our team members who assess suppliers.
Some suppliers may resist our approach because they have already completed the 400+ questionnaire for their other customers and our questions yield real gaps.
Bring your supplier risk management stakeholders and process together. Contracts, Privacy, any score/ratings services or third-party attestations you decide
you need.

#RSAC
Thinking Ahead
GRC as a Threat-Driven Function ­ what will it take?
­ Technical upskilling: Cloud, MITRE, more ­ GRC = a robust Blue Team ­ Extend Supplier Risk to "Ecosystem Security" and use this approach for
due diligence on M&A's ­ Leaders: take a rotation in SecOps and Cloud

#RSAC
Takeaways
Information overload is not good risk management GRC and Supplier Risk teams need to:
1. Not expect a different risk outcome if you don't change what you're doing
2. Evolve their mindset to be more threat-driven 3. Let go of those old chestnuts 4. Change their approach to be consultative not "auditative" 5. Upskill their team

#RSAC
Application & To-Dos
 Create business case for changing supplier risk program (improved risk management, increased speed and coverage of suppliers)
 Obtain feedback and buy-in from Legal, Compliance, other stakeholders  Review 30 questions, make them your own, and create your tools for the
process (workbook, supplier communications, workflow)  Create skills inventory and development plan for supplier risk team  Develop supplier risk calendar with prioritized "friendly" (early-adopter)
