Current State ­ No Synergy
In other words: lack of foundation to capitalize on today's advanced technologies delivering centralized and automated Detection to Response at machine speed

Complexity
Security and networking Point product complexity

Many Silver Bullet(s)
Hard to balance best of breed with integrated and synergetic security

Silo Operations
Security tools and teams that work in silos, and require manual work

Overwhelmed Humans
Skill shortage + high volume threat =
overwhelmed security teams

Why Should We Shift to Prioritize Synergy Over Silver Bullets?

#RSAC
Why Should We Shift to Prioritize Synergy Over Silver Bullets?
· Attacks are a progressive sequence of well coordinated, automated morphing events. · WE are fighting against time, that can be shorten only by AI-powered automation. · The foundation to effective automation is cybersecurity ecosystem level Synergy.

Weaponization Attackers preparing and staging the attack
For example, by coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload

Exploitation
For example: exploiting a vulnerability to execute code
on victim's system

Command & Control
For example: Command channel for remote manipulation of victim's system

Reconnaissance
Attackers engages in progressive profiling
For example: harvesting email addresses, conference information,
etc.

Delivery Delivering weaponized bundle to the
victim
For example: via email, USB, etc.

Installation
For example: Installing malware on the asset

Time to Detection AND Prevention

Action on Objectives
For example: Hands on keyboard, intruders accomplish

"By 2024, organizations adopting a cybersecurity mesh architecture to integrate security tools to work as a collaborative ecosystem will reduce the financial impact of individual security incidents by an average of 90%"
"Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2022: Cybersecurity Mesh, Felix Gaehtgens, James Hoover, Henrique Teixeira, Claudio Neiva, Michael Kelley, Mary Ruddy, Patrick Hevesi, 18 October 2021"
Executive Guide to Cybersecurity Mesh, 2022 Felix Gaehtgens, James Hoover, Henrique Teixeira, Claudio Neiva, Michael Kelley, Mary Ruddy, Patrick Hevesi. As of October 2021

To implement a cybersecurity mesh architecture today, look for:
· Deep visibility across all edges · Centrally managing distributed solutions · Consistent enforcement of policies · Real-time global threat intelligence across
Security Fabric deployments · Automating actionable responses · Broadest, most integrated open ecosystem
