How to apply what you've learned today
Next week you should:
­ Create an inventory of your sanctioned SaaS apps ­ Check what telemetry & logs you have from each vendor
Next month you should:
­ Audit org-wide configuration settings ­ Hunt down and kill unnecessary global access (e.g., "Anyone links")
Within six months you should:
­ Define data security policies for each SaaS app ­ Trigger alerts on policy violations and abnormal behavior
