Cyber Range on a Budget (for any organization)
Cyber Ranges (CRs) prepare individuals to deal with cyber incidents
CRs can be expensive to build & operate (or lease)
­ shared CRs offer limited access
Instead, we need DIY (Do-It-Yourself) CRs that can be set up easily at little or no expense
Almost any organization can accomplish this, even with limited time, money or other resources

How Easy is All of This to Apply to Your Real-World Organization?

I will show you how this has actually been done in
various organizations

You will view that "how" through the lens of your own particular organization

Whatever questions arise, remember, professors love to answer questions: ask!

...then you can take this back and promptly/easily test it in your own organization!

PHYSICAL ASSETS
Repurpose, Reuse, and Return

#RSAC
Cyber Range on a Budget (for any organization)

General concept of a low-resource DIY CR involves temporarily repurposing existing resources which, in-between such usages,
can be returned to regular functions

1) instead of dedicated space, use existing conference rooms, classrooms, or similar spaces

2) instead of dedicated computers, use employees / students existing laptops

3) instead of dedicated display technology, use either the room's

existing fixtures (like wall mounted TV monitors/projectors ) or

rolling stock (like tv monitors on wheels / portable projectors)

4) instead of dedicated servers with high-power computing capacity, rely upon existing medium-power desktop
5) instead of a dedicated intranet network, use the Internet, or (if available) an alternative intranet
6) instead of customized scenario content, create home-grown content or share / trade with other DIY CRs
These are all used only during a CR exercise
and then returned to regular usage afterwards

CYBER INCIDENT SCENARIO CONTENT
You Don't Need to Make This Stuff Up

#RSAC
Cyber Range on a Budget (for any organization)

Making lemonade out of lemons:
There is a seemingly unending supply of real-world breaches and attacks in the news almost every day
As wide-ranging examples for us to use
­ various types of "bad actors" ­ using various methods ­ against various targets / sectors ­ as well as responses by those targets ­ and typical results of those responses
Simply adapting these real examples yields a variety of scenario content, reducing the effort required to generate such scenarios

Instead of movie-quality visualization of such scenarios (using professional actors, expensive scripts, high-quality cameras, etc.)

such scenarios can be initially rendered simply through PowerPoint slide shows containing decision trees that follow various alternative
results (MS software that is available in most organizations)

Why "reinvent the wheel"?

Sharing such scenario content, as DIY CRs increasingly proliferate, allows organizations to share and trade scenarios (in various formats, including PowerPoints, videos, VR, etc.) amongst themselves

One or more central exchanges / clearing houses as trading hubs

Eventually traditional paper & videogame publishers could assess this new / growing market and create scenarios for sale at affordable prices

Apply What You Have Learned Today:

Next week you should:
­ Assess the resources that you have that can be temporarily repurposed (space, computers, networks, PowerPoint / video) ­ you may have more than you realize!

In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Test the use of those resources ­ Using a real-world cyber breach and/or attack, create a simple PowerPoint decision
tree using the events, responses and impacts

Within six months you should:
­ Fine-tune your DIY Cyber Range ­ Improve the quality, quantity and sophistication of your content ­ Explore opportunities for content sharing with others in your target sector
