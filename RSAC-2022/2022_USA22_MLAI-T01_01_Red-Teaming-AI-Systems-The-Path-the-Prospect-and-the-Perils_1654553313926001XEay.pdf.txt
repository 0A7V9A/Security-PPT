Next Week
­ Read "Adversarial Machine Learning ­ Industry Perspectives" (Link) ­ Browse through MITRE ATLAS (Link)
Next Month
­ Pick an ML Project and explore failures using Counterfit (Link) or Augly (Link)
How did it go? Was it easy to break your team's ML project? How did you address the vulnerabilities? What is your team's response and remediation plan?
Next Quarter
­ For the same ML project, go through an AI Risk Assessment exercise with your team (Link) ­ Make a plan for repeated application testing for a different ML project
