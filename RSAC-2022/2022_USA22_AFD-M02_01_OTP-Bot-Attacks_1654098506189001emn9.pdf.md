Telegram OTP Bot Detection

OTP Bots and Coinbase
Coinbase has been the target of many OTP Bots, especially in Telegram and WhatsApp advertisements
Most activity seen on the platform has been in relation to the purchasers of the bot for attacks on other institutions Identified bot attacks on Coinbase accounts have not been successful financially
Purchasers have typically been using their Coinbase account to buy access to the bot, then committing ATO's at other traditional financial institutions

Issues to FinTech
Victim association
­ Hard to determine users that are victims of these specific attacks ­ Credentials usually obtained in darknet market dumps, not always leading
to active and valuable accounts
Attack anticipation Identification of attack patterns
­ Pattern of sending activity ­ Pattern of login activity ­ Timing of password cracking
18

#RSAC
Industry Best Practices
Enabling and familiarizing users with security keys Use a different method of 2FA, such as biometrics Consistent monitoring of attack patterns by confirmed data Pro-active threat landscape monitoring Communication between financial institutions Educating users about current threat landscapes
­ Coinbase Earn campaign regarding account safety

Gathering Intel on OTP Bots Targeting Your Company
Keywords: "OTP bot" "SMS bulk" "SMS%" "authenticator"
­ "Bot" may be too broad ­ These keywords are typical of PURCHASERS of the bot ­ Further analysis can be made from those accounts, using IP and device
data
Telecos can search for spammed landlines or spammed nonworking numbers Analysis on user accounts that have customer service outreach
