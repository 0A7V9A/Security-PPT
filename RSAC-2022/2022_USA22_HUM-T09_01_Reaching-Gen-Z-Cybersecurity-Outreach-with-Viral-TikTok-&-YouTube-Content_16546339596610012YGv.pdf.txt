What is my job?
Engage beginners with social cybersecurity content. The goal: Make ethical hacking accessible to the next generation of professionals.

Why make ethical hacking content for beginners?

#RSAC
Access to talent and brand reputation
Written guides don't engage younger viewers Traditional content spreads slowly Gen Z is overlooked by traditional advertising approaches Great content breaks out of niches to go viral Free content makes ethical hacking accessible to young talent

What is already out there?

#RSAC
High-production quality commercials
Produce a star-studded, printer-heavy narrative Extremely expensive and high quality Hard for everything to involve a printer Can create unfulfilled expectations

#RSAC
Tutorial videos
Targeted at beginners Hit or miss topics Research takes time Technical issues sink a production Can be seen as guides for criminals

Creating the channel

#RSAC
Content creators who got it right

Brands that missed
"Phone on a Drone" "Whiteboard Wednesdays" Naked lady commercial Unrelated-industry professional interview Random marketing material
54

#RSAC
"Phone on a Drone"
Brand's most-seen video content One of the worst ratios I've ever seen 6M views, 10 comments No useful information
55

#RSAC
Unrelated-industry professional interview
Making someone from an unrelated industry talk about cyber content Worst of both worlds Low engagement I was the first comment
56

#RSAC
"Whiteboard Wednesdays"
Good idea Low production value Uncomfortable hosts Dry topics Comments are off Subtitles in Italian
57

#RSAC
The naked lady
The most-seen content by this infosec company stars a naked lady Comments are off I would not have done this...
58

#RSAC
Random marketing material
Too many owners = sales material polluting marketing efforts 17K subs have no idea what content they're going to get Is 109 views worth posting this?
59

#RSAC
Takeaways
Infosec content shouldn't be dry or boring
