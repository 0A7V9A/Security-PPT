We're Going to Turn NIST CSF Inside Out!
Deconstruct NIST CSF using some real-world models Overlay program maturity on top of NIST CSF Analyze CSF from both a tech stack and GRC perspective Pivot which of the five functions we prioritize Employ a few stupid memes on the way
But first, a quick bit of transparency...

Relax. This presentation is...
Based on 20+ years of practitioner cybering. Influenced a bit by every vendor relationship and affiliation I have, and yet...
Vendor-agnostic

Why are we here?

#RSAC
Why we are here:

#RSAC
So, we rely on frameworks like...
NIST CSF:
The most important things: ­Identify Hardware Assets (ID.AM-1) ­Identify Software Assets (ID.AM-2)
The things that are most at risk: ­Risk Management (ID.RM-1)

#RSAC
After we Identify, we Protect, right?
?

#RSAC
Meet Shiner the Sheepadoodle!
He protec He attac But most importantly He doesn't secure anything!

#RSAC
The distinction I draw:
"SECURE"

#RSAC
Better yet, a real-world model:

You have to
"See it"

Before you can
"Manage it"

And then you can
"Secure it"

* Flagrantly stolen from Steve Williams over at NTT

Common Sense, Right?
"See it" "Manage it"

#RSAC
"Secure it"

Minimum Viable Security ­ A Brief Aside
We are always supposed to implement controls based on known risk and the value of known assets, and yet...
­ How many of you need email protection? ­ How many of you need endpoint
protection? ­ How many of you need MFA? ­ Etc...

#RSAC
(Challenges with the model):
Limited tools available that: perform endpoint health checks, push patches and configs, and populate CMDB. UEBA -> Controls = Proprietary (& Change Management?) STIX/TAXII limited & not supported everywhere. SOAR not supported everywhere, provides little protection ATT&CK framework never 100% complete or current Purple Team & BAS must rotate through the estate

#RSAC
Key Takeaways ­ GRC:
· Start with NIST CSF and Focus on Identify-Protect · Detect/Respond/Recover will be more reactionary
· Once you have most of your estate in-hand, map to NIST SP 800-53 to get more prescriptive around your controls, start focusing more now D/R/R.
· Map to MITRE ATT&CK as you invert your program, starting with a known threat, working into Detection and Response, and using Recover to feed into Protect. Identify should not come up much, and the line between Protect and Recover should blur. GRC team has bridged with technical team by this time, and frameworks are populated based on real attack scenarios.
· Map to CVEs to close the loop, proactively applying ATT&CK to identified vulnerabilities for a D/R/R + I/P strategy.

#RSAC
Key Takeaways ­ Tech Stack:
· Get a CMDB in place and get Minimum Viable Security in place ("MVS"): · IA&M, Secure endpoint management, EDR, SASE w/CASB, Email Protection · IR consists of rudimentary playbook leveraging these tools
· Feed this into a SIEM with UEBA, add DLP, Insider Threat Protection, etc. as desired. · IR is more robust and prescriptive, centered around SIEM/SOC.
· SOAR drives SOC & your controls where possible, BAS w/ ATT&CK, STIX/TAXII, UEBA drives Controls where possible, IR automated where possible
· Purple team, purple team, purple team...

#RSAC
Key Takeaways: It's Really This Simple:

"Shields Up!"
(Identify/Protect)

"Test"
(Detect)

"Strengthen"
(Respond/Recover)

Common sense, right?
