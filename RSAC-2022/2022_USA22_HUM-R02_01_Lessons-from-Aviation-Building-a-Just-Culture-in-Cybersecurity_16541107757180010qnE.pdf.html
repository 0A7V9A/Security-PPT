Contributory factors

Alice's training
Passed filters
No link scrubber Anti-malware not updated

Supplier reported filters started picking it up after 12 hours
Reports of the same phish from other users were in SOC queue
­ Too many tickets, not actioned for 24 hours (breach of policy)
­ This has been the case for 4 months, SOC is 2 FTE under-resourced
­ Steve (relatively new SOC Manager) did not escalate or prioritize recruitment because he was OK with the queues, they are just like his old company and nothing bad happened there

#RSAC
No harm, no fault?
Bob argued that the RAT was so new, that even if he had configured the laptop properly, the anti-malware solution still wouldn't have picked up the RAT. So he wasn't part of the problem.
No harm, no fault has no place in a Just Culture. It encourages risk-taking

What now?
This month

#RSAC

Look at the culture in your organization?

Is it a Just Culture?

Take this scenario, what would your organization have done about:
­ Alice ­ Martin ­ Steve ­ Sarah ­ Bob

Would the Actions have been the same?

­ People

­ Systems

72

What now?
Next month

#RSAC
Would implementing a Just Culture improve your information security?
­ Do you have capacity for this?
What would need to change to implement a Just Culture?
­ Who would need to be onboard? ­ Who could lead this?
You need a senior champion
­ Will you be able to get commitment
73

What Now?
This year

#RSAC
Internal communications
­ Consistent ­ Everyone onboard
Change the post incident response to look at contributory factors Training of analysts in the methodology Peer review of the analysis and actions Rigorously track actions Evaluate
