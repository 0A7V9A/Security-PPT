Hi, I'm Kelly

Hi, I'm Sounil

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

4

"Think how hard physics would be if particles could think."
­ Murray Gell-Mann

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

5

It is no coincidence that infosec feels hard...

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

6

Why does infosec defense seem so rife with futile and profligate decision-making?

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

7

We make the same mistakes over and over. We try really hard but seem to get nowhere.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

8

"Behavioral science" isn't just a buzzword. This conundrum stems from our cerebrum.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

9

Appreciating our brain behavior better is how we bolster superior security strategy.

@swagitda_

I. How do our brains work? II. Lizard Brain vs. Philosoraptor III. Making better decisions

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

11

I. How do our brains work?

"The purely economic man is indeed close to being a social moron. Economic theory has been much preoccupied with this rational fool."
­ Richard Thaler

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

13

So, what do we mean by rationality here?

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

14

Behavioral economics studies how people actually make decisions vs. classical theory

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

15

In theory, every human makes choices to maximize their payoff (expected "utility")

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

16

Homo economicus can perfectly calculate the probabilities of expected outcomes

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

17

In reality, information, attention, and time are all limited. Our rationality is "bounded."

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

18

Every human (even you!) is only locally rational -- global rationality is a fantasy.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

19

Spoiler: a lot of "human error" is a violation of what's considered "globally" rational...

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

20

Understanding how our behavior deviates from Homo economicus matters for infosec

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

21

Evolution designed our brains for efficiency, not for pure logic (or we'd die in the wild)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

We were once very simple creatures with very simple functions (eat food! run away!)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Then we evolved more complex processing (gossip with tribe! envision the future!)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

We can grossly simplify all of this into more instinctual vs. cognitive parts

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Our ability to imagine the future ­ and our future selves ­ is the most recently evolved

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Protoreptilian brain: self-regulate biological functions to maintain stability for survival

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Limbic system: brain structures involved with survival behaviors (fight, feed, f...)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Neocortex: brain structure involved with cognition, planning, language, sensing...

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

But we usually simplify our brains into two systems for thinking: System 1 & System 2

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

System 1 = quick, automatic, unconscious; wants fast, easy, simple thinky thinky

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

System 2 = effortful thinky thinky; cognition and purposeful choices vs. instincts

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

We can refer to this first system as our "lizard brain"!

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

This second system is the "Philosoraptor"

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Lizard brain decides to stay up super late playing video games after a tough week.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Philosoraptor decides to go to bed early and have a refreshing workout in the morning.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

As you might suspect, Lizard Brain and Philosoraptor disagree on infosec choices...

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

II. Lizard Brain vs. Philosoraptor

How do the Lizard Brain (LB) and Philosoraptor (PR) manifest in infosec?

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Heuristics, shortcuts, and folk wisdom

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Experimental evidence and analysis

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Vulns are predators! They threaten our survival! Eradicate them at all costs!

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Non-emotional framing of vulns, use of analogies, focus on impact vs. vague "risk"

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Success = no danger ever! Stay safe within the cave and never leave it

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Success = support adaptive cycles, enable sustainable growth and innovation

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Thoughtful metrics are hard; therefore, let's use shallow ones for less thinky thinky

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Nuanced view of metrics that considers context and complexity of systems

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Tribal mindset ­ Gatekeeping other tribes, hoarding knowledge, bottlenecks

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Village mindset ­ neocortex brain seeks connection and collaboration to build things

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: I don't know what containers, APIs, [X] are, but my instincts say they're dangerous

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Seeks evidence, asks questions with an open mind, ponders new ways to do things

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Familiarity = importance. I've heard it a lot and can recall it easily, so it must be true.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Familiarity is successful marketing and doesn't indicate importance or truthfulness.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Autonomic nervous system triggers fight or flight response

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Rest and digest response ­ mindful handling of stress (psychological resilience)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: Perfect prevention of failure is the way

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Nothing is perfect; what matters is preparing for recovery

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

LB: I am a being of pure logic and reason! Why are other humans so irrational??!

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

PR: Lizard brains are the default; we can't force humans to change their programming

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

III. Making better decisions

Security programs that don't assume Lizard Brains = the default are doomed to fail.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

(And our Lizard Brains tell us that we really don't want to fail!)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Cognitive biases aren't inherently bad; they can either help or hinder our goals

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Viewing instincts and emotions as "wrong" thinking will also distort decision-making

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Our goal is to design systems that work with our brains vs. require unrealistic patterns

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Being aware of cognitive bias isn't enough. The human brain sucks at self-monitoring.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Plus, many of us tend to overestimate our ability to overcome these biases

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

(It's still good to be on the lookout, so long as you remain aware you can be a fool, too)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

We must make the "right way" compatible with the lizard brain ­ simple, easy, fast

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Repetition and practice turns tasks from Philosoraptor processes into LB instincts

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

But, repetition needs immediate feedback in order for it to satisfy the lizard brain

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Exploit availability bias for good ­ ensure your messages are repeated and pithy

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Create your own heuristics... just like we have with Lizard Brain vs. Philosoraptor :)

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Opportunity cost consideration: the "null baseline" is a fast, easy, simple heuristic

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Audit where you're introducing friction for humans, which Lizard Brain hates...

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Per Richard Thaler: phishing warnings are "sludge"; it's very natural to ignore them

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Instead: "nudge" safer decisions ­ make the fast, easy, simple path the secure path

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Cognitive biases are chronic, not acute ­ so solutions must manage rather than "fix"

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

IV. Conclusion

Our default cognitive mode, the lizard brain, wants fast, simple, easy thinky thinky

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Infosec decision making involves a lot of lizard brain because of stress and F.U.D.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Lizard brain distorts infosec outcomes via myopia, blame games, poor investments

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

No one can be a Philosoraptor all the time.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

Requiring humans to be "rational" and blaming them when they're not is cruel.

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

We need to design security programs, policies, and tools for lizard brains instead

@swagitda_

@sounilyu

As security leaders, understand your lizard brain to optimize your own behavior

@swagitda_
