Need for Transformation Framework
Communication. With the rapid pace of hiring and team formation, we needed a structure for effective onboarding, communication, and team alignment. Focus. We needed to make sure teams were focused on the right priorities and that our priorities were being driven by business risk. Resources. We needed mechanisms to determine and justify resource needs. Measurement. We needed to ensure mechanisms were in place to measure and report on progress of the security program.

Measurement Against Objectives (Progress)
· Are the objectives still in alignment with business priorities and risks? · What is the measurable progress against each key result supporting the
metric? · Are changes required to set more realistic or achievable objectives?
Measurement Against Framework (Effectiveness)
· What is the expected end target based on set out plans for the year? · How can this be broken out and measure progress quarter by quarter? · How well is the organization progressing in maturing our security
controls across?

Applying What You've Learned Today

#RSAC
Summary of Lessons Learned
Security as a Company-Wide Program - Ensure input from and alignment with supporting departments and stakeholders
Take Program Assessment in Context - When determining objectives and priorities, consider multiple inputs, not just the baseline and target program assessment
Communicate the "Why" - Understand and communicate the "why" behind the target state ­ tie target state back to organization-specific risks
Allow for Scale - Create documentation and educational materials to support rapid team growth and scale
Collaboration Tools - Have the right tools for cross-functional collaboration and visibility
Create Flexibility - Allow flexibility in the framework to adjust for program scale
22

#RSAC
Applying what you've learned today
Next week you could:
­ Understand where your security organization is in the journey ­ building, stable/steady growth, undergoing transformation
In the first three months following this presentation you could:
­ If you are building/transforming, establish security program and governance framework, taking into account considerations and lessons discussed today
­ If you are stable/steady growth, evaluate your current security program and governance framework and identify opportunities for improvement and scale
Within six months you could:
­ Implement core elements of the framework and conduct baseline and target assessment ­ Continue to implement and mature framework, using lessons learned at your organization
