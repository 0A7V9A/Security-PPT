THE REAL PROBLEM OF A FAKE IDENTITY
What is Synthetic Identity Fraud?
· The use of a combination of personally identifiable information to fabricate a person or entity in order to commit a dishonest act for personal or financial gain
· Different from conventional identity theft ­ implied identity not typically associated with a real person
The Federal Reserve led a focus group of industry experts to develop this industry-recommended definition to foster improved awareness, measurement, detection and mitigation.

THE REAL PROBLEM OF A FAKE IDENTITY
Challenges in Detecting Synthetic Identity Fraud
· Onboarding validates information, but not the customer's complete identity
· Customer identity typically not reauthenticated after account opening
· Payment behavior may not indicate fraudulent activity
· Limited ability to detect with conventional fraud models

BEGINNING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
How to Fight Synthetic Identity Fraud
· A complex identity requires an equally intricate fraud response strategy.
· Experts suggest that a multi-layered approach is the most effective mitigation strategy.
- Leverage manual and technological processes to identify common characteristics of synthetic identities
- Balance these actions to minimize friction and provide a positive customer experience

BEGINNING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
Start With Identity Proofing
Identity proofing is verifying the identity presented is legitimate and belongs to that individual.
· Continue to perform required customer verification
· Verify foundational identity elements via multiple methods
· Cross-reference identity elements with alternative credit data or additional information that supports proof of life
