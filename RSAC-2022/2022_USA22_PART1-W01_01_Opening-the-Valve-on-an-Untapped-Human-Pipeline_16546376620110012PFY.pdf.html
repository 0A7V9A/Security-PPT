SURGe's hierarchy of needs for an entry level role

Technical knowledge
We've got m any s enior technologis ts on the team but it would be nice to have 2 s om eone to pitch in
Ability to communicate orally and written

aren't s ucces s ful.

In d e p e n d e n t
1 In a COVID world on a global WFH team , les s direct m anagem ent is preferred

#RSAC
My approach to writing the job description
· Should not use exclusionary terms around "years of experience" or gender
· Be very upfront with being OK with second career · Ask for needs not wants. · Provide fun, engaging prose that is representative of our team
culture

#RSAC

#RSAC
Responsibilities
· Example vignettes that give flavor of the role
­ "LinkedIn Live panels"
· We are an outward facing team. Communication abilities are important
­ Conference CFP submissions and security research
· Publish or perish!
­ Copyediting a script for social media
· New media and collaborative work
­ Trusted advisor to customers
· This is still a software sales company

#RSAC
Qualifications
· No years of EXP? How do you make sure someone is qualified?
­ Refer back to my SURGe hierarchy of needs
· Ask people to be proficient in one of a variety of skills
· Do you really need a Python AND data science AND RE expert in one person?
· If you have a specific need, call it out
· People have to communicate on my team. That was a non negotiable.
· Help people to NOT self select out.
· "Pe rh a p s yo u a re co m in g h o m e fro m yo u r la st d e p lo ym e n t to Afgh a n ista n , o r yo u a re a syste m a d m in wh o wa n ts to m o ve in to cyb e r. Ma yb e yo u a re a lib ra ria n o r jo u rn a list lo o kin g fo r a ch a n ge ? Ju st fin ish e d u n ive rsity?"
