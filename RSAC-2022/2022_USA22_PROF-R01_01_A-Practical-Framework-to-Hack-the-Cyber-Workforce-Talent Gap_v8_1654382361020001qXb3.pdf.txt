Workforce of Today

 The cybersecurity workforce shortage is
not only a concern within government, but across the Nation.
 There are 3.1 million unfilled positions
worldwide
(2021 (ISC)² Cybersecurity Career Pursuers Study (isc2.org)
 To prepare for tomorrow, we must
invest.
 How do we recruit talent? How do we
identify talent?

What's causing this gap?
 Non-university educated job seekers are
not aware of cyber/ICT job opportunities, and don't feel qualified
 Perception of tech as math-intensive,
high qualification, and elite discourages potential applicants (esp. women)
 Employers do not have accurate needs
assessments for their digital workforce, distorting training incentives
 Current paths focus on Universities and
certs miss the vast need for practical "middle skills" training

What is Neurodiversity?

Neurodiversity
The range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the
human population

Neurodivergent
One whose neurological development and state are atypical, usually viewed as abnormal or extreme. The
term was coined in the neurodiversity movement as an opposite for "neurotypical"

The Autism Spectrum Is:
 A developmental disability that is caused by differences in how the brain functions. People with autism may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in different ways.
 Differences in the functional areas of executive functioning, socialization, communication and sensory/motor functioning are viewed as the `core' symptoms of autism for adults.
 How autism presents varies considerably in each individual on the autism spectrum, resulting in varying levels of support needs.

Why Target Autism?
"In one study, autistics were 23% faster that non-autistics in solving some types of figural problems and 42% faster in solving some types of analytic problems"
Source: Harvard/Univ of Montreal Study, 2009
Adults with autism are employed at an alarmingly low rate. Global estimates of unemployment and underemployment range as high as 80-90%.
(Dew & Alan, 2007)

#RSAC
Neurodivergent candidates, especially those on the autism spectrum, can be well suited for cyber work for a variety of reasons:
Accelerated problem solving Innovative approaches to challenges Specialist knowledge and skills in areas of interest Detail orientation; follow instructions and rules very accurately

The hyper-systemizing and excellent attention to detail found in autism can

produce high levels of talent in systemizable domains.
(Baron-Cohen, 2009)

Writing a Neuro-inclusive Job Description

Do
Ensure job posting is clear and free of jargon
Clearly differentiate 'must have' skills and experience from 'nice to haves'
Include a statement affirming your organization's commitment to diversity and inclusion, including who to contact for reasonable accommodations.

Don't
Just reuse old job descriptions that may include requirements that are not necessary for the role you're hiring for
Use complex fonts or colors
Publish without having someone else read and check for clarity

#RSAC
Be Self Aware

 Be aware of situations where you think:
· "That's common sense..." · "Everyone knows that..."
 "Things that are obvious to me are
different than the things that are obvious to you."
 Understand your team's assumptions,
unspoken rules and norms and be able to articulate them.
 Give explicit rules for expected behavior

Check your assumptions

#RSAC
Give Clear Directions
Use Words Literally or Explain Them
Words can have a more expansive meaning to a person or group. Explain it all unless using the dictionary definition.
Give a Due Date
Saying "when you get to it" or "fit it in" doesn't provide a target to allow us to plan our time and workload.
Clearly Prioritize
Tell me what is important. Saying "this is a rush" doesn't help me know how it ranks to my existing priorities.
Put it in Writing
We get requests every day. It is hard to remember the specifics. Writing or drawing keeps details from being lost.
