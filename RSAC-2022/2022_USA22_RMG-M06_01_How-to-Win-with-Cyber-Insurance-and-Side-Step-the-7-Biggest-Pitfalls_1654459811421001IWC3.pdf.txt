#RSAC
The State of the Industry, Challenges, Estimating Risk
Recent history, what's covered

History: the Cyber Insurance Industry
2017 ­ "we just want to be in the cyber market"
Inexpensive add-on by agents with no cyber-knowledge, no security questions
2021:
­ $20B market ­ But a very poor "loss ratio" ­ Lloyd's: "no more silent cyber"
2022:
­ "costs are up and more hoops to jump through" (CISO quote) ­ larger companies get multiple bids; on-site checks ­ Sublimits come into play ("up to $100K for X expense")

#RSAC
Cyber war exclusions ­ "collateral damage"
Cyberwar: "the use of physical force by a state against another state ... whether war was declared or not." The term "cyber operation" is defined as "the use of a computer system by or on behalf of a state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate or destroy information in a computer system of or in another state." Protections:
­ don't speculate on attribution ­ get your own sources legal counsel if necessary
*Cyber Insurance and War Exclusions (darkreading.com)
6

#RSAC
What's coming?
Increased rates, specific security capabilities
­ standardized scoring?
Do cybersecurity companies offering warranties actually pay? "External view" vs "internal view" of security?
­ Will there eventually be premiums which fluctuate according to scores?
7

#RSAC
Known Challenges ­ how do Insurance companies estimate their risk?
No reliable actuarial tables ­ fluctuations can be extreme Cybersecurity posture can change from "positive" to "disastrous" in seconds
­ Who else's cybersecurity is in the mix? (i.e., SolarWinds)
Cyber isn't a building or an earthquake
­ It may come closest to an adrenaline junkie getting life insurance
8

#RSAC
Interacting with the insurance company
Who to reach out to during an incident and what are time constraints? How often must we report our cybersecurity posture, and what constitutes proof? How does scoring last year compare to this year?
9

#RSAC
What insurers help with
Usually:
­ Ransomware negotiation and remediation ­ Notification costs ­ Costs to restore & recover data ­ (you should have a prioritization
schedule) ­ Forensics ­ what exactly happened (ascertaining fault, attribution) ­ Loss of immediate income
Often:
­ Ransom (extortion) payments ­ maybe with sublimit ­ PR and marketing related to brand management/damage ­ Customer attrition (how measured? CMO question)
10

#RSAC
Almost Never
Long term effects Brand damage IP ­ the damage involved in having secrets shared Security upgrades in the aftermath Acts of cyberwar
11

#RSAC
The details of coverage
For what period will expenses be paid? Long tails Will they consider your investments? (table tops & DR planning) Beware attribution!
12

#RSAC
Determining coverage: bracketing
Top down: protect the full value of the company?
­ Reasonable for a small company?
Bottom up: protect based on the probability of threats, the cost of repairing the damage , what threats you are most susceptible to This middle ground = gushy, but let's take a shot!
13

#RSAC
Summary of 5000 mid-sized companies, 2021
95% of claims were paid 70% of the time insurance providers paid biz recovery costs But: "We don't pay for losses due to outdated or unsupported systems", etc.
14

#RSAC
The Best Way to Do It!
Where the CISO comes in

#RSAC
The CISO's involvement is critical
Finance, Legal & CEOs rarely understand cybersecurity CISOs are the only ones who can:
­ Estimate the risk of breach & impact ­ Review sublimits & exclusions ­ Know what tech requirements can be met ­ Manage the recovery process (in alignment with the policy)
The CISO should be involved in deciding how his/her team spends their time
­ Reporting scores & tracking compliance
16

#RSAC
What else is the CISO* uniquely able to do?
Answer the questions: 17 cyber insurance application questions you'll need to answer | CSO Online * Will DR planning help reduce costs? What about BCP, BIA? Estimate recovery (time, spend)
* or top security officer
17

#RSAC
3 levels of analysis ­ how much time do you have?
1. Quick: a few hours
­ Estimate cost & probability, + 4 critical risk factors
2. Weeks/month
a) Is there acceptable, alternative biz continuity? (low-tech or virtual desktops) b) How secure are your users, suppliers, partners? c) What is typical posture for your industry?
3. 3 months or more ­ dig in & collaborate internally until you reach diminishing returns (BCP, etc.)
18

#RSAC
Summary
At the very least ­ review the current policy
­ Who are your contacts in case of an incident, timing rules? ­ What are security scoring & reporting expectations? ­ What is covered and for how much?
Gather the numbers, share, commit to scoring and/or new tech Work the politics Ask for more cybersecurity budget!
19

#RSAC
Tools to Get it Done
...and a Sample Case

#RSAC
Pop Quiz re Colonial Pipeline ransomware
What Russian group was it attributed to? How much was the ransom? If you have THIS enabled on your PC, some Russian malware will by-pass you.
21

#RSAC
Lots of squishy numbers!

Ransomware Probability
· Low - Sophos, 2021 = 51% hit; 50% of those were successful  25% risk
· Medium - IDC said in 2021 37% were hit with medium level severity
· High ­ 47%

Data Breach Probability
· Low - Varonis, 2021 = 27%, 50% severe  13.5% risk
· Medium - Ponemon & IBM say 28% probability of a "successful moderate level attack"

Cost
· Low ­ Coveware, $6K for small company
· IBM/Sophos says average cost data breach $4.24M; ransomware, full recovery $2.8M
· High - Ponemon & Proofpoint, 2021 "large US companies" $14M on average

Other Cost components:
· Personal data up to $380 for Healthcare; IBM/Ponemon = $180 average per record
· Average ransom: $170K
· Average BEC loss $183K (FBI says $108K)

Note: it's very hard to find a study NOT done by a cybersecurity vendor!

Total Potential
$2.8M $4.24M $180K $183K

Expected $3,013,000

Potential $7,403,000

Opinion Question: Does $3M seem like an okay absolute minimum?

* Sophos, IBM&Ponemon, Varonis

23

#RSAC
Insurance/Company size: not a linear function
Smaller companies need more protection relative to their total company value
­ A catastrophic incident may bankrupt the company
Suggest: Companies from $1M - $20M need to insure themselves for close to what they are worth $500M companies don't need to insure for their value
24

#RSAC
Where we are headed
Inputs: - Baseline Risk in $ = [Probability x Cost of Risks] - $3M - Incident Sensitivity Multiplier = [4 risk factors] ­ 1x? 2x?
Baseline (min insurance) x ISM = $suggested insurance
What was my disclaimer at the beginning? I am NOT an ________?
25

#RSAC
A Method to Measure Sensitivity to Incidents
Incident Sensitivity Multiplier: Identifying 4 of the biggest factors
A. Reliance on technology to run the business (downtime hurts) B. Customer sensitivity (likeliness to sue if data is compromised) C. Confidence in ability to recover (tested off-line backups, etc.) D. Confidence in cybersecurity posture (the basics: vuln scanning, MFA, etc.)
Suggested: a simple point system to calculate a multiple of the probable loss number, aka your Incident Sensitivity Multiplier

#RSAC
How do these number affect each other?
Rule:  Add all 4 numbers, divide by 4 and multiply the resulting number by the
Probable Loss to get a number that reflects Incident Sensitivity This gets us to an Incident Sensitivity Multipler
One way to use it: Climbing gym: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6/4 = 1.5 x $3M = $4.5M minimum insurance by Q&D method (Climbing Gym, 1/5 or 20% of the value of the company)

#RSAC
Adjusting the Model to Fit Better
Three things can easily be changed: 1. The baseline number (= minimum coverage) 2. Incident Sensitivity Multiplier: what is the spread? This can be derived from
internal opinions; what does Risk/Finance/CEO think it should be, max/min?
­ This table = 1-2 but internally if they want to go much higher, include that in the spread ­ i.e., 1x to 5x / example: $10M - $50M ­ if scores on all 4 factors are poor, 5x is the coverage
Scores for the 4 factors of Incident Sensitivity Rule: Add all 4 numbers, divide by 4 and multiply the resulting number by the Probable Loss to get a number that reflects Incident Sensitivity
32

#RSAC
Incident Sensitivity Multiplier
Hypothesis: when the multiplier reflects an appropriate level of insurance, it can begin to bring some rigor to the process and can be adjusted over time as attack conditions and costs change. However: always confer with an agent on whether the output is reasonable in your specific case ­ consider breaking down agent recommendations to fit the model. Always take a bigger baseline if it's an option! Richard Hobson: "Buy as much as you can afford ­ take the number you think you need & double it."
33

#RSAC
Other ways to go about it
Additional possibilities:
­ Add 10-20% of annual revenue ­ for biz interruption to be included ­ Insure to full value of the company ­ the potential for catastrophic loss ­ Use full potential cost as baseline
Agent: "I recently ha d a client renewa l with existing policy limits of $5M tha t wa s only offered $3M a t renewa l. They ha d no losses but their deductible went from $5,000 to $25,000. Their premium went up 5x!"

Helping Finance/Legal Understand
What makes cyber special & different?
1. Extreme asymmetric attack advantage (one good Zero Day in the hands of one good hacker can lay waste to hundreds of companies in days)
2. All software and hardware has weaknesses (Zero Days) 3. 24 years of experience shows: constant evolution in cybercrime innovation,
leapfrogging protection efforts 4. Cybercrime innovation gets shared real-time with criminals via researchers,
protective patches ­ constant, brilliant innovation for free 5. AND we can't run business with no humans and fully air-gapped from the
internet the routes by which all cyber risks travel

Getting What You Want
Listen first.
If that's not possible (grumpy Finance!): offer 17 questions, scoring requirements, tech requirements, protocol to follow post-incident, "let's meet again"
Do NOT offer numbers without getting theirs first.

#RSAC
Caveats, Gotchas and the Top 7 Pitfalls!

#RSAC
The top reasons insurers don't pay
1. "It's related to the same breach as last year" 2. "We only pay up to _____" (sublimit) 3. "We only pay for costs AFTER you notify us" 4. "We gave you negotiators/forensics/media advice you didn't use" 5. "Your depiction of your security posture was inaccurate"

The Fine Print...be sure to track security compliance
Comply with reporting/scoring expectations Report scores as agreed upon What else is in the contract?
­ This is where the risk folks & legal can help
BTW...has HR followed through on every background check?
(insider risks)
42

#RSAC
The 7 Biggest Pitfalls ­ quick list
1. Not getting enough coverage 2. Not being explicit with coverage (no silent cyber) 3. Not socializing estimations (get the history first) 4. Committing without knowing the required posture reporting 5. Sharing too much with the insurance company 6. Auto-renewing without a price check & re-assessment 7. Not ensuring that all critical threats are covered
43

#RSAC
The 7 Biggest Pitfalls/Errors
1. Not getting enough coverage
­ Consider any cost-reductions they make available (scoring, tech) ­ Get competitive bids
2. Not being explicit with coverage 3. Not socializing tradeoffs, estimations & expectations
­ Being ignored by Finance/Legal
Don't end up the scapegoat!
­ Document your suggestions
44

#RSAC
The 7 Biggest Pitfalls/Errors ­ continued
4. Over-committing or under-committing to reporting 5. Sharing too much or too little 6. Don't renew a policy without:
­ Reevaluating pricing & the threat environment
7. Not ensuring that all critical threats are covered (use scenarios)

Apply What You Have Learned Today!
Next week you could:
1. Get a copy of the current cyber insurance policy 2. Analyze according to this presentation (caveats, requirements, coverage level)
· Query insurance agent as necessary
3. Suggest a meeting to Listen First and discuss findings
In the next 3 months following this presentation you could:
1. Meet with peers and management to get a good idea of Biz Continuity needs (and help them understand cybersecurity issues better!)
2. 2nd meeting, clarify where the current policy falls short or what it would take for it to fit (boost cybersecurity investment!)
3. Request resources/budget to accommodate & put a plan in place
