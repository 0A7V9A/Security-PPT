Cybersecurity starts with visibility...
We often sit in between the threat actors and their targets ­ having visibility into the battleground of the most sophisticated cyberattacks. This gives us perspective into the sources and nature of an attack so that we can investigate it, contain it and deal with it decisively. And intelligence from network gives us better insight into emerging threats allowing us to help our customers prepare for what's coming.
