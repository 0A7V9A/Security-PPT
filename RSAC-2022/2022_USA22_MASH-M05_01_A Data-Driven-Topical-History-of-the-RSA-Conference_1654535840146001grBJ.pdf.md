What did we learn today?
RSAC's storied history is ripe for analysis Some topics have staying power, some don't Often times things we think are different are more of the same Speakers are using less buzzwords and more neutral language Sometimes exhibitors are ahead of the game, most of the time the talks are where the new action is Overall the diversity and size of RSAC continues to grow.
