Do you know your unknowns?
"...we know there are known knowns...things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns...that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns--the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones". Donald Rumsfeld US Secretary of Defense

Why should you care?
10 ­ 11 July 2019 Cybersecurity Ventures expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15 percent per year over the next
five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history...

Do you have a global footprint?

#RSAC
Or a regional one?

#RSAC
Does it span all time zones?

#RSAC
Or spread across multiple geographies?

#RSAC
Do you have multiple brands? Banners?

#RSAC
In multiple countries? Under different formats?

Do you collect lots of data?

#RSAC

#RSAC
Or, how about in an
average minute at "Yourco"

#RSAC
How do you make sense of it?
This?

How do you make sense of it?

This?

Or this?

#RSAC
A 3-step process to discover your environment:
1. What's out there? 2. How mature is it? 3. How does it compare vs. standards?

#RSAC
What you'll learn
 Understand how to approach the challenge of knowing your environment.  Learn how to filter huge amounts of data in complex networks.  See how to present it in a digestible, easy-to-read format for analysts...and execs.  Gain ideas on how to rate maturity in order to address "first things first"

What you'll learn (in pictures!)
 Understand how to approach the challenge of knowing your environment.  Learn how to filter huge amounts of data in complex networks.  See how to present it in a digestible, easy-to-read format for analysts...and execs.  Gain ideas on how to rate maturity in order to address "first things first"

#RSAC
Step #1: What's out there?
19

1. What's out there?
Start by surveying your teams

#RSAC
Tip: be sure to group core services
Examples
­ Incident Management ­ Identity and Access Management ­ Security Infrastructure Controls ­ Risk, Management and Compliance
Remember to involve product owners
­ Allows for better validation...and understanding
20

#RSAC
And how do you want to present it?

Textually?

Tabular...ly?

21

#RSAC
Negative, you want to "catch their eye"

Like a "heads up display"

Key elements to consider:
Keep it concise Use plain language Make it "filterable" Let it speak for itself

22

#RSAC
Step #2: How mature is it?

#RSAC
2. How mature is it?
Start with your product owners
Assess each capability individually, whether deployed from your core or procured locally Utilize technical means, such as:
­ Network scans ­ Vulnerability scans ­ Penetration tests ­ Red teams
Focus on the configuration and not just the presence of your security hardware and software
24

#RSAC
Sample Maturity Legend
For assessing capabilities

Title

Description

Mature Core Provider Capability is provided by the Core Capability Owner. Capability exists and is considered mature for its context.

Mature Other Evolving

Capability exists and is considered at least as mature as the comparable capability that could be consumed from Core Capability Owner. Capability exists, but is not considered mature or does not have majority/complete coverage within its context. This is a flag and the details should be captured in the notes. Note: "Evolvingc" means Consumed, but not mature

Undeveloped

Capability does not exist. This is a flag and the details should be captured in the notes.

Consumed

Capability is provided by somebody other than the Capability owner (i.e. a 3rd Party). This is a flag and the details should be captured in the notes.

Unknown

Capability is unknown or has not been completely assessed.

N/A

Only use "Not Applicable" IF the capability is truly not applicable - blank is better than an incorrect answer.

How does it compare vs. standards?

#RSAC
3. How does it compare vs. your standards?
· Again, your product owners should know this, but may need your help to establish/document
· Decide early which framework you intend to follow
· US NIST? ISO? COBIT? OEM?
· Cybersecurity (CSF)? Risk (RMF)? Privacy? Big Data Interoperability?
· Regardless, it should help answer:
· Where are you strongest? · Where are you weakest? · Where are your biggest gaps (vs. target)?
· And then repeat it...

Where do you want to expand into?

#RSAC
What priorities should we focus on?

#RSAC
Put it all together with a Heat Map

Core Service priority

(notional and not representative)

Segment priority

#RSAC
OK, then how can you continuously improve?
Stick to your priorities
­ But ensure they're aligned with the business
Revisit ratings with product owners
­ At least annually, but more frequent is preferred
Measure, share and compare results
­ Since a little competition is a great motivator  ­ aka OODA/PDCA

#RSAC

In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Decide which framework your want to measure yourself against ­ Assemble questionnaires/guides/manuals to assess the above ­ Identify who your product owners are and socialize the process with them
Within six months you should:
­ Begin surveying your product owners to get them involved and engaged ­ Decide on how you want to categorize the data ­ Begin plotting the data so you can begin to see your biggest areas for improvement
