Types of Social Engineering

Unauthorized Payments
Account Takeover
· Unauthorized 3rd party is actively sending and authorizing payments
· Resulting from credential harvesting scams or real-time attacks
· Bank's responsibility is clear · Fraud controls more established

Authorized Payments
Authorized Push Payment Voice Scams · Victim is sending and authorizing
payments · Bank's responsibility varies by region · Since victim is authenticating the
session, fraud controls are lacking · Reputational risk to the bank

Summary and Q&A

#RSAC
What Have We Learned?
Education campaigns are a good start but can lead to alert fatigue Strong authentication and device profiling is not sufficient protection Analyzing the entire user journey and layering multiple detection methods is key
The attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication ­ collaboration is essential The cost to the victim is devastating!
