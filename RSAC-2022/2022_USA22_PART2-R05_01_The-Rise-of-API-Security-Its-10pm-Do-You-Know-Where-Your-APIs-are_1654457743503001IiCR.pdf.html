Summary ­ Today's Take Aways
APIs are equals of code functionality APIs are no longer the ingress/egress boundary Cannot be managed like network protocols Software drivers are massive drivers (accelerators) for APIs API-First/Product put APIs at the forefront in design and delivery Manual discovery/documentation will never keep pace with software creation Accelerating pace requires automated discovery Essential API security integrated into DevOps/DevSecOps pipelines and toolchains
