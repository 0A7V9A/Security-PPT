CMMC and Insider Threat
The CMMC "Awareness and Training (AT)" domain contains AT.L2-3.2.3 Insider Threat Awareness, which calls for an organization to "Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of Insider Threat." The Assessment Objectives according to NIST SP 800-171A are as follows: Determine if: [a] potential indicators associated with insider threats are identified; and [b] security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat is provided to managers and employees ..."Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g. Training for managers may be focused on specific change in behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations."
