Why Staying Secure Is Getting Much Harder

OVERWHELMING COMPLEXITY

GROWING THREAT

FAILING AT THE BASICS

On premise, public cloud, hybrid cloud, multi cloud, SaaS, containers....
IT is changing too fast for security to keep up.

The adversary is getting smarter and has developed a sophisticated
ecosystem to monetize development, deployment and
execution of ransomware campaigns.
Ransomware as a service is driving high volume attacks.

Most of the breaches we see start with a failure of basic security hygiene.
You don't necessarily need more security products.
You can successfully deal with the threat by tackling the basics and using capabilities you may already
have.

The Statistics Suggest We're Struggling...

435%
Increase in ransomware attacks since 2020 Deep Instinct

100s of Businesses from Sweden to U.S.
affected by Kaseya Cyberattack

60% of breaches
involved vulnerabilities for which a patch was available but not applied CSO
4X
projected increase in supply chain attacks in
2021 ENISA
46%
Increase in attacks against OT devices in 2021 Outseer

$2.3M The amount in digital currency
recovered from ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline
Ransomware "business" is growing. Ransomware as a Service gangs continue to gain clients and provide software for more attacks
$11M Amount JBS Holdings is said to have
paid in ransomware after recent attack

When your business is data...
You care a lot about backups... And restoring data is a practiced skill... But recovering all your data at once? Customers have tough questions Interdependencies between systems can cause significant delays

Lives are at stake...
Electronic health records are offline Care limited to emergency-only Patients are being redirected Media pressing for answers Lack of pre-planning can lead to months of time for recovery

#RSAC
Key Lessons from the 3rd Incident
Train your staff to recognize suspicious attachments Plan for recovery and resilience, not just response Check your cyber insurance policy

#RSAC
What We Covered:
Three incidents with similar avoidable causes Simple cyber hygiene recommendations to speed recovery The requirement to balance people, process and technology (no silver bullets) What executives should ask for to reduce the impact and speed of recovery from similar threats

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Ask when the last time your incident response plan was tested ­ Check your cyber insurance policy for proper coverage and exclusions ­ Ensure critical information needed for recovery is available offline
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Identify and eliminate all non-multifactor access to your network and applications ­ Regularly train your users using targeted phishing simulations ­ Execute a full incident response, recovery, and restoration simulation
Within six months you should:
­ Test the effectiveness of your endpoint, e-mail, and cloud controls against real-world threats
­ Regularly check your endpoints, network, and cloud for vulnerabilities / misconfigurations ­ Implement lessons learned from your response simulations to focus on resiliency
