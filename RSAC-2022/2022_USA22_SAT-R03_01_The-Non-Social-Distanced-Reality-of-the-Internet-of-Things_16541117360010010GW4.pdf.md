IoT Attack Trends
The first half of 2021 saw 1.5 billion attacks against IoT devices (Kaspersky 2021)
The work-from-home environment led to increased targeting of corporate devices
Attackers are creating botnets, stealing information, mining cryptocurrency, and gaining privileged access
New and old vulnerabilities alike are being exploited

New Rules of the Road
The technical standards community and policymakers are racing to set a baseline for IoT security. A few examples:
2020: NISTIR 8259A IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline ETSI EN 303 645 Cyber Security for the Internet of Things: Baseline Requirements US IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act Australia Code of Practice 2021: UK "Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure" proposed legislation ISO 27402 Device baseline requirements under development

Are IoT security policy and standards working?

Global Cyber Alliance Internet Integrity Program
THE POWER OF DIVERSITY Addressing security and stability issues requires supporting and promoting diverse networks. The Internet Integrity Program brings together key players in internet infrastructure operations, as well as adjacent industries, in order to identify top priorities for addressing cybersecurity issues that cannot be solved by any single actor, or subset of actors, independently. KEY PARTNERS: Internet Ecosystem Institutions Network Operator Groups ISPs and other infra operators

#RSAC
IoT Attack Data Project Objective Use data on real IoT attacks to offer evidence on the validity of the most widely accepted IoT security policies and standards. Support a data-driven approach to public policy for IoT security.

Methodology
Analyze GCA's Automated IoT Defense Ecosystem (AIDE) historical data for trends and changes in IoT attack methodologies Configure ProxyPot, GCA's proprietary honeypot infrastructure, with common technical controls referenced in IoT security policy and standards and use A/B testing to measure changes in attack success

What was Tested
Using ProxyPot honeyfarms, virtualized devices were configured with common controls from policy and standards to test their effectiveness "in the wild" against attacks:
­ "Secured access" (no default passwords) ­ Data in transit is protected ­ "Patchability" (keep software updated)
14

#RSAC
The A/B test setup
Honeynet
­ 70 honeypots ­ Emulating open source firewalls, network-attached storage (NAS) solutions, and
operating systems commonly found in IoT devices: FreeNAS, OpenMediaVault, OpenWrt, pfSense, XigmaNAS, M0n0Wall, and SmallWall. ­ For each of the 7 emulations, 10 honeypots were deployed, 5 with default passwords and 5 hardened with strong passwords.
Data collected for almost 2 months
­ April 5 to June 3, 2021
The system recorded 786,086 sessions, which resulted in 1,113,729 HTTP requests and 1,083,277 responses.
­ A small number (6,432) of those sessions were legitimate scans by search bots. The remaining 779,654 sessions were classified as "attacks".

It's coming from everywhere ­ nowhere to hide
March 2022 Attacks seen on US sensors and from US to other sensors
18

#RSAC
Findings: Validating Security Controls
Common technical controls significantly reduce attack success No default passwords: tried and true
­ The only successful login attempts recorded were on devices with default passwords
Attackers prefer non-secured communications protocols
­ Mirai is still the most common source of Telnet-based attacks over five years later
Updated software prevents device break-ins
19

#RSAC
Findings: Policy Gap
Attackers are attempting to exploit the software stack of devices The majority of login attempts observed were targeting the embedded web servers rather than the devices themselves The gap: The scope of software in IoT security policy and standards is generally focused on operating systems rather than applications
­ Keeping application software updated matters
20

#RSAC
Apply the IoT Attack Data Project Findings
As soon as you can you should:
­ Take every IoT device you have with a default password off the net
In the near term, policymakers should:
­ Adopt recognized baseline IoT security standards for procurement and citizen-owned devices
Security professionals should take these recommendations:
1. No default passwords. 2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy. 3. Keep software updated. 4. Continuously monitor IoT communication for unauthorized communications and attacks.
21

#RSAC
Discussion & Call for Partners
How can the Global Cyber Alliance use AIDE data to be more constructive in IoT development and management going forward? How can we set up honeyfarms to collect indicators for informative patterns? How can we combine device transactions into larger trends? What should we be thinking about to generally improve IoT security?
