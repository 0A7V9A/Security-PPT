Is your DNS leaking?

Understanding DNS

#RSAC
DNS (Domain Name System)
5

#RSAC
How DNS Works?
6

#RSAC
DNS Encryption

#RSAC
DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS)
Runs on port 443 Traffic is hidden from network admin Larger packet sizes Higher latency, more coding Good for privacy
8

#RSAC
DoT (DNS-over-TLS)
Runs on port 853 Traffic is visible to network admin Smaller packet sizes Lower latency, less coding Not great for privacy
9

#RSAC
DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
DNSSEC extends the DNS protocol by adding cryptographic authentication for responses received from authoritative DNS servers. DNSSEC is the only protocol with protects against cache poisoning.
10

#RSAC
DDR (Discovery of Designated Resolvers)
Clients connecting to a new network don't have any way of automatically finding encrypted DNS servers that might be available. DDR creates special, new, DNS records that point to servers using DoT or DoH.

Is DNS security discussed at your organization?

#RSAC
NSA and CISA Release Cybersecurity Information on Protective DNS

#RSAC
Protective DNS: March 2021
DNS lookups were unencrypted DoH is fine for home or mobile users Only use designated enterprise resolvers, disable others Balance of DNS security, privacy and governance
14

#RSAC
PDNS Guidance Outlined from NSA and CISA
Block: ­ Malware domains ­ Phishing domains ­ Malware DGA Supports: ­ Content filtering ­ SIEM integration ­ DNSSEC validation ­ DoH/DoT ­ Customizable policies ­ Hybrid architectures
15

#RSAC
Why Protective DNS?
DNS is ubiquitous DNS was not built with security in mind Bad actors use domain names Malicious domain names are often knowable
16

#RSAC
Fast Forward: March 2022
Zero Trust Multiple Defensive Layers Encryption and Secure Protocols
17

#RSAC
CISA's Shields Up Program

Reduce the likelihood of damaging cyber intrusion

Take steps to quickly detect a potential intrusion

Ensure the organization is prepared to respond

Maximize the organization's resilience to a destructive cyber incident

"90% of successful cyber-attacks start with a phishing email"

Now What? How to Apply - Part 1
Next week ask how does your DNS work: ­ How is your DNS configured and who is managing your
DNS? ­ When and why were settings configured? Over the next three months: ­ What DNS are you using for authoritative and recursive?
(Public, private, independent?) ­ Do you have encryption, filtering, VPNs, firewalls that are
relying on DNS? ­ Are you using tools like AD, Hyper-V, specific hardware,
etc. that will impact DNS settings?
24

#RSAC
Now What? How to Apply - Part 2
Within six months you should: ­ Regularly audit and review your DNS security
settings at least quarterly ­ Defining roles and responsibilities around DNS ­ Consider tools supporting protective DNS:
Enabling DoT and/or DoH in your environment Blocking malware/phishing/ransomeware at DNS Aggregating your DNS queries with your SIEM
25

#RSAC
In Summary
DNS is critical infrastructure DNS has become a major attack vector for bad actors DNS best practices are heading towards protective DNS Patch your leaks!
