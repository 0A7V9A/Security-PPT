Value Proposition for Automated Control Testing
what problem are we solving

#RSAC
The Importance of Trust

Consumers want to do business with companies that are trustworthy custodians of their sensitive data; however, trust in companies' ability to protect data is declining and many business leaders are underestimating the gap.

85%
of global consumers "wish there were more companies I could trust with my data."

How has consumer trust in companies' ability to protect data over the past 2 years changed?

Effort as Proxy for Value

Organizations operate hundreds of cyber risk controls across thousands of assets and spend significant time and money performing periodic manual tests to assure appropriate control performance.
As the modern technology environment becomes more dynamic, manual testing is increasingly cost-ineffective and leaves windows between tests where controls may deviate from our risk tolerance.
Organizations across several industries are spending
more than 15,000 hours
completing cybersecurity assessments each year.
Despite that...

54%
of requestors say the data they get from assessments is only somewhat valuable
in decision making.

55%
of organizations feel assessments are not accurate reflections of their security posture.

Effort  Effectiveness

Inconsistent Measurement
Traditional testing methodologies rely on point-in-time observation, inquiry, or sampling, which fail to ensure sustained control effectiveness.

Doesn't Scale Up
The adoption of new technology capabilities and increasing demand on resources to provide assurance of cyber risk management effectiveness requires progressively greater effort.

Poor Time to Detect
Manual assessment frequency leaves a window for potential concerns to go unnoticed.

Automated Control Testing
the solution

#RSAC
Creating an Automated Control Testing Program
An Automated Control Testing Program provides timely detection of control failures, higher quality assurance of cyber controls, and improved resource utilization within assurance and control testing groups.

Improving Effectiveness

While most security solutions are tailored
to the second and third lines of
defense, we aim to target and add value
to the first line of defense.

Provide real-time insight into security control effectiveness
Reduce exposure to cyber risk by shortening time from onset to identification of issues
Facilitate increased assurance around riskinformed decision-making activities

Malicious Code Protection

The organization implements malicious code protections for systems, assets, and data

Requirement Details
The organization: 1. Must define and document a policy and procedures addressing malicious code protection 2. Must implement malicious code protection mechanisms on all systems commonly affected by malicious
software 3. Must implement malicious code protection mechanisms at key system entry and exit points 4. Must document any assets or system entry and exit points without malicious code protection and a threat-
based rationale if any such assets exist 5. Implemented malicious code protection mechanisms must detect and eradicate malicious code 6. Must update malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available 7. Must configure malicious code protection mechanisms to: - Perform periodic scans of assets and key system entry and exit points - Real-time scans of files from external sources at key endpoint or network entry/exit points as files are downloaded, opened, or executed - Block or quarantine malicious code when it is detected - Be unable to be disabled by non-malicious code protection personnel excepting for short term exceptions 8. Must log and/or alert malicious code protection personnel in response to malicious code detection 9. Must address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and resulting
potential impact on the availability of key systems

Define - Controls & Effectiveness Metrics

The control and data source is the organization's anti-malware solution (e.g., Symantec) installed for in-scope systems and operating effectively.

Metric Type

Metric Description

Requirement Mapping

Coverage

Is the control installed (present on disk) on at least 90% of the in-scope population?

SI-03 ­ 2, 3, 4

Availability

Is the control operating (running in memory) on at least 90% of the in-scope population?

SI-03 ­ 5

Recency

Are 90% of assets of the in-scope population updating normally (are agents running updated software/definitions/heuristics)?

SI-03 ­ 6

Effectiveness

Are control configurations compliant with the expected standard? Are 90% of quarantine/blocking alert volumes within the tolerance zone?

SI-03 ­ 7

Exceptions

How many assets are exempt from coverage?
