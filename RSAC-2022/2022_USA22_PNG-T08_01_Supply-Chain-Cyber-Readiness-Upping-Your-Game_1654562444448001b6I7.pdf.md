Hackers stole employee credentials to gain access to corporate systems.

Tools of the Trade

They sent emails with malicious links or attachments that helped steal the recipient's credentials.
They planted malicious code on trusted websites that they hoped their targets would visit. The code recorded visitors' confidential info. With stolen credentials, hackers used virtual private networks and remote desktop programs to stay hidden and maintain access to internal networks.
