The Current State

#RSAC

Identity is now more difficult to protect

Yesterday
Employees Hired for one job Single access point People Office-bound

Today
Employees, contractors, suppliers, partners
Roles change frequently
Access changes based on circumstances
People + applications + machines
Hyper-dispersed, mobile

Understanding the Identity Challenge

Identities not limited to actual people
­ Devices, apps, bots, etc
Multiple tools deployed
Tools are independent and siloed
Identities in one tool unaware of identities in others
Fragmented state created
Multiple processes created based on types of tools in use

Why Start with PAM
You probably already have it!

Current State
Identities, especially privileged accounts are being targeted by bad actors 85% of organizations say that employees have more privileged access than needed High levels of friction introduced to users who are trying to access privileged assets remotely Achieving Zero Trust is practically impossible due to underlying complexity Opaque insights into privileged user activity Impossible to leverage analytics to proactively identify and act on risk

Future State
Securely store, manage, record and analyze privileged access
Provide the right access at the right time ­ and nothing more
Connect remote privileged users to servers and other critical resources through any browser, with no VPN required
Adaptive Zero Trust attained with ability to apply and manage credentials just in time
Know what your privileged users are doing, working with session monitoring/recording
Use machine learning and behavioral biometrics to identify deviation from "normal" behavior
