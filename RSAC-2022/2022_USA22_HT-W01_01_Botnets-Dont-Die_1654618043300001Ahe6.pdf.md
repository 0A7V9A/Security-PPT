Act 1: BotNet Foundational Concepts

#RSAC
....but first a quick Botnet demo

Bot Backend Demo

#RSAC
Why Not Hijacking Modern BotNets?
Technology has improved but same concepts Ex: Russia war used weaponized botnets
Key characteristics of new botnets
­ Uses 3rd party authentication ­ Much better encryption ­ Harder to track ­ You need BotNet protocol to connect
Key Point: Harder to take over, so older is a better target!!!
7

#RSAC
Old BotNet Examples
EarthLink Spammer: 2000 ­ Phishing attack sent 1.25 Million emails from legitimate websites. Attacker was sued for 25m by earthlink. First large botnet attack
Storm: 2007 ­ Network grew to 1millon+ devices. First peer-topeer botnets
Neverquest ­ Targeted users of more than 100 banks leverging the Neutrino exploit kit
Mirai: 2018 ­ DDoS attack took out the USA east coast internet capabilities hitting insecure IoT devices
8

#RSAC
Good People Try To Help
Buy / Take over attacker servers to identify victims Identify communication from infected systems
Good People will Contact Victim if
­ Victim is a customer to the vendor ­ Contact seems possible ­ No concerns of privacy by identifying the victim ­ Or don't contact but note the possible victim

Act 2: .... Turning into a bot

#RSAC
Host Systems Post BotNet Infection
Botnet services and features are "post exploitation" aka a separate Attack before becoming a bot Plug-ins features include RATs, keyloggers, webcam captures, password dumps, file exfiltration services, uploads, etc. Accomplished thru helper applications, DLLs, Registry Keys Helper applications are run under the botnet process, migrated to other processes, and in some cases uses privilege escalation.
13

#RSAC
BotNet Pre and Post Behavior

Common Attacks
Phishing sends to exploit kit
Common vulnerability exploitation
Password compromise
Standard exploitation can lead to BotNet infection

Post Exploitation
Wrapped with more than Bot aka chain exploitation
Wipers triggered when Botnet needed
Ransomware or other Malware
Spreading focus to grow botnet

14

#RSAC
Specific BotNet Leave Behinds
Command and Control remote shell software Modified routing tables Infected registry Bootup modification Execution path hijacked AutoStart setting modified New windows services such as allowing greater access than system administrators
15

#RSAC
Botnet Incident Response Timeline from investigated attack Part 1
Initial Access and Exploitation (Phishing Email attachment) UserPrpfileSvcEop.exe downloaded from GitHub (Escalate Privileges) Create additional accounts (Persistence) RDP to internal systems (Move Laterally) Process Explorer (Internal Recon) Process Hacker (Establish foothold)

Act 3: Trying to find old Botnets ­ Steps we tried

Threat Hunting 101
Proactive or Reactive Proactive needs a hypothesis which continues to change

#RSAC
Threat Hunting Botnets
Examining major Botnets from 2001 ­ 2009 ­ Theory: Botnets have unused domains easier to obtain Problem 1: Most major Botnets from this time didn't use direct C&C ­ Most were written for DDoS attacks and spread thru worms Problem 2: Major Botnets had their static domains taken or seized ­ Gov agencies or private security firms were using them
19

#RSAC
Threat Hunting Botnets
Problem 3: Botnets with DDNS traffic are hard to predict on the cycle the botnet was active on. ­ DDNS domain names are predicable, but the order and time
the botnets connected are not always predicable. Problem 4: Botnet traffic is being monitored and reported on.
Scope adjustment: Well known older BotNets off the table
20

#RSAC
New Focus for Research
From what was learned, we had to adjust the focus
· Target unpopular botnets
· Popular ones are taken over or unusable due to defender responses
· Validate they have connected to C&C · Successfully obtain the domain(s)
· We have our domains ... cool ....what's next?
21

#RSAC
Act 4: Our Hypothesis ­ Necromancer?
Can we hijack already hijacked systems?

#RSAC
Botnet Resurrection Workflow

Step 3

Step 5

Step 1

Research old botnets (unpopular ones). Buy associated domains

Step 2

Create listener and wait for communication from compromised systems. Results = list of infected systems

Attack user (from list) to gain system access. Locate and obtain botnet to reverse engineer
OR use research about botnet
OR obtain botnet from disclosed information about the botnet

Step 4
Reverse engineer botnet binary to identify communication protocol

With protocol identified, connect to any future systems that communicate with domain and use as part of new BotNet
Upgrade authentication, encryption, etc. to protect your new victims

23

#RSAC
Act 5: How we did it

#RSAC

#RSAC
Let's get back to our story
We now have domains we purchased. What's next?
­ Do we have any traffic going to these domains. ­ Easy enough, get a cloud VPS and point the DNS to the IP address ­ Run packet captures.
Okay looks like we have incoming traffic on ports. Can we do anything with this????
26

#RSAC
PCAP Files
27

#RSAC
PCAP Artifacts
Odd destination ports Source port does not increase Duplicate and reused ACK
28

#RSAC
Netcat Listener
A simple Netcat listener test showed incoming connections Data and connections on ports were not useable Data was not readable and looked like garbage Data was most likely encrypted or using something other than clear text (this is to be expected).
29

#RSAC
Results 1
We observed quickly data is encoded and not readable. Examining the binary encryption being used, we probably don't have time to break it. However, it tells us that these Bots are still active ­ at least the client portion. We want to take over a bot ­ what is the next step?
30

#RSAC
Try 2 - Cheating
Finding binaries with known analysis of botnet C&C authentication Registering the domains Writing our own C&C server.... or better ... try using a Metasploit Listener Seeing reverse connections
31

#RSAC
Discussing a reverse shell example

Setting reverse-shell listener worked Why? We didn't have full access to the Botnet but did have partial access. We used Bot binaries in our analysis that had the features we are looking for...let's discuss this example

Screenshots are examples of function not from live test systems

32

#RSAC
The Results
Wait did we succeed? Did we just have an old dead Botnet connect to our new command and control
33

What we achieved and could not achieve
Living on the (Botnet) Edge

· Basic access to infected endpoints
· Access to C&C domains
· In some cases, remote shell access to systems
· Ability to install additional software on endpoints.

· Full control of Botnet features · Full Control of Botnet software and features · Control or access to Botnet developers or learning their identities.
34

#RSAC
Remediation Recommendations

#RSAC
Fixing the "Impacted" is on YOU
It is very unlikely infected system owners will be notified of a Botnet Controller takedown You must perform forensics and build a defense in depth strategy to identify potential BotNet hijacking or other threats Systems may not show activity for years before being resurrected!
36

#RSAC
Wrap Up

#RSAC
Take aways ....
There are many very large BotNet takedowns that have thousands to millions of endpoints still compromised. With the right focus, you can identify ronin BotNet artifacts and piggyback off another attacker's breach. You should assume compromise when building a defense in depth strategy This problem is not going away on its own. It requires YOU to take action!
