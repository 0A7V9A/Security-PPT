Why did the RTF adopt the Due Diligence concept?
The Ransomware Challenge

Ransomware attacks are inherently stressful events

Many victims make a payment decision without
all the facts

Governments are enacting
restrictions on ransom payments

Organizations often face criticism for
their decision

Employing due diligence techniques mitigates these challenges

#RSAC
What do we mean by "due diligence"?
Taking steps to:
· Assemble the relevant, knowable information · Analyze that information · Use the analysis to drive a decision · Document the analysis and resulting decision
Based on reasonableness, NOT:
· Perfect information · Exhaustive analysis · Extraordinary measures · Unlimited time

#RSAC
Why conduct a due diligence review?

Imposes discipline during a  Provides needed structure

chaotic, stressful time

 Ensures availability of relevant, obtainable information

Helps clarify the choice

 Eliminates extraneous issues  Highlights benefits and costs of available options

Provides justification for chosen course of action

 Can be used with customers, shareholders, investors, the media, regulators, etc.
 Demonstrates that actions are based on analysis, not emotion

#RSAC
What constitutes due diligence?

#RSAC
Review Organizational Status

System functionality

Impact to business operations

Impact to customers
and employees

Likelihood of data
exfiltration

#RSAC
Gather Relevant Information

Assess Technical Situation

Estimate Revenue
Loss

Identify Stolen Data

Confirm Legal
Obligations

Determine Payment Legality

Understand Insurance Coverage

#RSAC
Analyze the Information
This step involves asking a series of questions that bear on the payment question:

How do the company's values and culture affect the
decision?

How much time would be saved by paying the ransom?

What costs will be incurred regardless of payment decision?

What costs or losses will be avoided by paying the ransom?

What is the reputational effect from either option?

What is the likelihood of becoming a victim again if payment is
made?

What portion of the costs will insurance
cover?

Make Decisions

Analysis should clarify the benefits
and costs of the potential choices

Comparing benefits and costs
may generate counterintuitive
results

#RSAC
Regardless of the analytic results, the decision to pay or
not will remain a judgment call

Beyond the payment decision, the organization will have to decide whether it should:
 Report to law enforcement or other government agencies  Acknowledge the ransomware attack publicly  Make the payment decision public

#RSAC
Document Decisions

The final step in the process focuses on documenting the
previous four steps to:

Create an auditable trail for decisions
Develop succinct explanations for
decisions
Reduce the likelihood of another successful attack

#RSAC
Conclusion
Due diligence is not technically complex, but it is organizationally challenging Does not inform every necessary decision during a ransomware attack
Benefits from following due diligence: · Assurance that key pieces of information will not be missed · Clear justification for the pay/not pay decision · Capability to meet potential government requirements · Ability to communicate that decision clearly
Committing to such a process before an attack happens is critical
