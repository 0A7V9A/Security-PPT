The Problem: Not enough AppSec Pros.

So we scale.

Security Champions
A Security Champion is a member of a team that takes on the responsibility of acting as the primary advocate for security within the team and acting as a first line of defense for security issues within the team.
Or more plainly: The person who is most excited about security on a team. They want to read the book, fix the bug, or ask the security questions. Every time.

What is a security champion?

#RSAC
Your communicator · They deliver security messages to each dev
team, teaching, sharing and helping
Your point of contact · They deliver messages to the security team,
and keep you up to date on what matters to your team
Your Advocate · They perform security work, for their dev
team, with your help. · They also advocate for security.

Recruiting Your
Champions

#RSAC
#1 Rule in Recruiting
Do not "voluntell" someone to be a security champion.
Attract the right people instead.

#RSAC
#2 Rule in Recruiting
Ensure managers are on board and will give the champs time to do this important work.

a

Recruit

@SheHa#cRksSPAurCple

Ask for volunteers instead of appointing people without consent
Provide opportunities for them to reveal themselves
Add to your email signature that you are looking
Attract volunteers
­ Use lunch and learns or trainings ­ Anyone who asks questions or attends all the events is a potential champion ­ Use interesting titles for events if you can
Your new mantra will get you results: "It's my job to serve you"

Coaching
(a style of Teaching)

#RSAC
Coaching
Coaching means enabling individuals and teams to achieve their full potential.
Facilitating the exploration of needs, motivations, skills and processes to assist them in making real, lasting change.
If we want teams to start practicing a secure SDLC, we need to support them getting there.
If we want security champions, we need to constantly reinforce the values we want them to evangelize.

#RSAC
Coaching
For Champions: · Set up office hours · Set repeating meetings · Help them prioritize their security activities or bugs · Always be available · Help them set goals, then achieve them · Teach them specific skills or tools · Ask them what they need, then provide

#RSAC
A special note on Delegation
Some items shouldn't be the responsibility of the AppSec team, even if you know how.
· Fixing security bugs · Updating frameworks · Planning releases or upgrades · Assignment of bugs to developers · Running every scan · Implementing and/or tuning every tool · Writing unit tests
The list is endless, delegate what makes sense.

#RSAC
Do Not Delegate
Some items shouldn't be delegated.
· Validating SAST results · Giving security's approval on new technologies (or
anything else on behalf of your team) · Using new tools without proper training · Training new champions
We are looking for partnership and assistance, not replacements for our team.

#RSAC
What is the recipe we will follow?
1.Recruit 2.Engage 3.Teach 4.Recognize 5.Reward 6.Don't Stop!

#RSAC
It's important to recognize your champions.
We want them to know they are doing a good job, and not feel like the are trying really hard to do two jobs, for one paycheck.

#RSAC
@SheHacksPurple

#RSAC
Recognize:
· Create a Certificate to put on their wall,
· Recognize them in front of their peers (special virtual background, star on their name is slack, etc.)
· Make sure to put a note in their performance review

#RSAC
Recognize:
· Tell their boss every time they do something that makes a big difference
· Send them an email and tell them when they did something big, let them know that YOU saw
· Make their role on their team clear to them and their peers

#RSAC
What is the recipe we will follow?
1.Recruit 2.Engage 3.Teach 4.Recognize 5.Reward 6.Don't Stop!

#RSAC
Reward them!
Reinforce good behavior, instead of punishing bad.

#RSAC
Reward good behaviour with anything you (reasonably) can.
· Security-related gifts - books, videos, training, CTFs. · Giving them your time and attention is a reward. · Help them with more than just security. · Let them see a new tool first. · Let them help you make decisions. · Anything else you can think of.

#RSAC
What is the recipe we will follow?
1.Recruit 2.Engage 3.Teach 4.Recognize 5.Reward 6.Don't Stop!

#RSAC
When in doubt, overcommunicate.
If you do not communicate regularly, your program will disappear.
Quickly.

#RSAC
Don't let it slip
· Consistency is key · Even if you just meet with them once a month to check in
with them · Some champions will need more of your time than others,
and some will perform better than others · If you have accidentally `dropped' your schedule, pick it back
as as soon as possible · Culture is a practice, it must be repeated over and over

#RSAC
