Industry Traceback of Illegal Robocalls

#RSAC
The Rise of Illegal Robocalls
"As the telecommunications industry has advanced and expanded into IP-based telephony, costs have decreased as competition increased, benefitting consumers greatly. These benefits, however, have eroded the chains of trust that previously bound voice service providers. Partly due to the rise of [VoIP] software, the telephony industry no longer consists only of a limited number of carriers that all trusted each other to provide accurate caller ID information. Because there are now a multitude of voice service providers and entities originating and transiting calls, bad actors can more easily take advantage of these weakened chains of trust to target consumers with illegally spoofed calls."

#RSAC
How do we Apply this?
Illegal robocalls targeting organizations and/or their customers can cause real harm Tools are available to take action to identify the robocallers and their enablers These tools offer more than mere investigation; they can also help to disrupt the fraud and enable further action Awareness of call center service providers and their methods can also help disrupt call flow by:
­ Blocking money laundering methods ­ Detecting and disabling service providers ­ Providing more meaningful informed Public Service Announcements
