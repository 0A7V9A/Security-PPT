Mobile Networks and the Digital Economy
Mobile networks play an integral role in the digital life of subscribers, and have evolved far beyond enabling voice calling and SMS. The advent of 5G will further expand the potential utility for cellular technology. According to GSMA, global 5G connections will reach 2 Billion by 2025.* Protecting the most prominent personal data involved in mobile communications must be a critical consideration.

Promoting Subscriber Privacy
With global digitalisation advancing there is increasing concern about the privacy implications. The sensitivity of the information collated means that any compromise can lead to damaging breaches of user privacy. Enforcing privacy protection has emerged as a key focus for multiple regulatory bodies worldwide.

What is an IMSI?
The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is a unique subscriber identifier allocated to the SIM by a Mobile Network Operator (MNO)
The IMSI uniquely identifies an MNO subscription.
It can be used to confirm a subscriber's identity and monitor their location, calls and SMS messages.
The IMSI should be considered private information.

IMSI Catchers and Subscriber Privacy?

Despite representing highly-personal information, the IMSI is sent in clear over-the-air, completely unencrypted in the current 2G, 3G and 4G technologies (as defined by 3GPP standards).
This exposes the IMSI to significant security vulnerabilities, most notably IMSI catching attacks.

How an IMSI Catcher Works:

#RSAC
Promoting Subscriber Privacy through Standardisation
The 5G standards developed by 3GPP introduced the possibility for MNOs to encrypt the IMSI before it is sent over-the-air. However, there is potential for
significant variability in terms of implementation.

This creates various scenarios where the IMSI is not protected, and consumer privacy is still at risk:

The IMSI encryption feature is not activated in the network.
The IMSI encryption feature is activated in the network but end-users with a 5G device do not use a 5G SIM which enables IMSI encryption.
The device executes the cryptographic operations.

Comparing Options for IMSI Encryption

Encryption in the 5G SIM

Encryption in the Device

Ownership and control
Flexibility

MNO owns and controls IMSI encryption implementation
MNO can request the manufacturer to support MNO-specific security algorithms within the 5G SIM

Security level

Tamper-resistant secure elements, the foundation of the 5G SIM, offer the highest level of security as certified by recognised schemes

OEM owns and fully controls implementation OEMs determine implementation; MNOs cannot impose a specific algorithm
Security is neither certified nor dedicated to the device

Production
Qualification effort
Performance

SIM produced and provisioned in secure, regulated facilities Streamlined and simplified qualification process
Relatively slower processing, but still a seamless user experience

Devices may be built in unregulated facilities
Complex qualification process due to diversity of brands, models and operating systems
Potentially fast computation within the device

Interoperability

Well-established interoperability between different 5G SIM implementations

Increased risk of interoperability issues

Comparing Options for IMSI Encryption
MNOs are recommended to protect privacy by managing IMSI encryption within the 5G SIM, rather than the device.

What about Lawful Interception?
There is an important balance to be found between protecting a citizen's right to privacy, and ensuring that law enforcement agencies can track and
monitor criminals when necessary.
IMSI-encryption prevents unlawful and malicious usage of IMSI catchers. Law enforcement agencies will still be able to track and monitor targets with the collaboration of MNOs.

#RSAC
The Case for IMSI Encryption within the 5G SIM
The privacy implications of sending the IMSI in clear over-the-air are significant given the vulnerability to well-known attacks from IMSI catchers. There is potential for significant variability when implementing IMSI encryption, creating various scenarios where the IMSI is not protected, and consumer privacy is at risk. The recommended way to enforce privacy is to manage this IMSI encryption within the 5G SIM, rather than the device. Governments and other law enforcement agencies will still be able to utilise lawful interception to track and monitor targets. Beyond mobile handsets, SIM-based encryption is the only viable way to establish interoperability across consumer and industrial IoT use-cases.

What is the TCA Recommended 5G SIM?
· The SIM / eSIM is the only platform which can be used to secure 5G network access according to 3GPP ­ the 5G standardisation body.
· TCA first defined the Recommended 5G SIM in December 2018 to outline which technical features of SIM technology address the challenges MNOs face, beyond network access, when migrating to 5G.
· The technical definition has now been enhanced to align with new use cases introduced by 3GPP's Release 16 Specifications for 5G Phase 2.

Enhancing the Recommended 5G SIM
· In the same way that network core architecture is evolving, SIM technology is transforming to meet new challenges and opportunities introduced by 5G
· The latest updates respond to powerful new features introduced by 3GPP Release 16 for 5G Phase 2 · The guidance provided in the technical document relates to both 5G Phase 1 (3GPP Release 15) and 5G
Phase 2 (3GPP Release 16). The TCA Recommended 5G SIM is fully backwards compatible.

5G SIM Deployments Gather Pace

TCA member data showed substantial increases in 5G SIM shipments in 2021.

This builds on advances made in 2020, which marked the first year of widespread 5G SIM deployments.

The `Recommended 5G SIM' as defined by TCA promotes the highest levels of security, privacy and functionality in 5G networks to maximise operator investments and support 5G use-cases.

#RSAC
Unlocking the potential of 5G
TCA has established a Working Group committed to evolving and optimizing 5G SIM technology to enhance 5G network services.
TCA Recommended 5G SIM: A Definition TCA's Recommended 5G SIM helps MNOs maximise investments in core 5G network infrastructure by selecting the right choice of SIM technology at 5G launch. This enhanced definition supports new use cases introduced by 3GPP's Release 16 Specifications for 5G Phase 2.
