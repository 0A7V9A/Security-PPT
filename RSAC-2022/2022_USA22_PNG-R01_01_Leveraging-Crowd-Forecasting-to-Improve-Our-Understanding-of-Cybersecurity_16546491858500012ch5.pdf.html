Our Agenda
· What is crowd-forecasting? · Beta-testing the concept through Metaculus, LLC · Preliminary results and lessons learned

#RSAC
First ­ An Example
· Will a U.S.-incorporated insurance company decide to stop binding coverage for ransomware payments before December 31, 2022?
· Answer that Yes or No
· Now let's aggregate the wisdom of the crowd here at RSA

#RSAC
What It Might Mean
· Strong Yes -- Losses will exceed what the rate-paying market is willing to bear and individual insureds are likely to be on their own as insurers drop back.
· Weak Yes -- Choosing an insurer has become crucial in any company's risk mitigation plan as insurers clearly do not have an across-the-board handle on outcomes.
· Ambivalence -- To watch like a hawk. · Weak No -- A discontinued insurance program is a management failure at
that insurer, not an industry failure. · Strong No -- Ransomware is pervasive enough that no insurer can dare stop
covering it unless they plan to fold up their cyber insurance portfolio entirely.

What Is Crowd-Forecasting?

#RSAC

Crowd-Forecasting

· The Main Idea: Sufficiently large groups of individuals who are incentivized to share predictions will more often accurately forecast the likelihood of future outcomes.

Three possible advantages for cybersecurity:

1. Information aggregation

2. Reduce Noise/Bias

3. Validation of Hypothesis

#RSAC
When Does Crowd-Forecasting Work?
· Robust use already: ­ Internal crowd-forecasting platforms at companies ­ Classified prediction markets within the IC (say no more ...) ­ Financial industry ­ Fantasy Football leagues ­ Kalshi - A real prediction market!
· Additional challenges: ­ Settlement or Resolvability (aka the fine print ­ like OPM Hack) ­ Technical/Niche Questions (aka generating enough predictions) ­ Platform Manipulation / Moral Hazard (aka playing to the test) ­ Privileged Information (aka confidential information)

The White Hat Cyber CrowdForecasting Challenge

#RSAC
Platform Design
Hosted by Metaculus, LLC · Opened up a Cyber Crowd-Forecasting challenge
(https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/white-hat/) · Open competition + invited participants · Questions released in 3 waves · Preliminary resolution of some questions last month (so we
could share with you)! · Tournament ends Dec 31, with resolution by June 2023

#RSAC
Sample Questions
· Geopolitics / Government
­ What we want to know: Will Chinese aggression towards Taiwan sharply escalate?
 Will China launch a successful (major) cyberattack on Taiwanese critical infrastructure before December 31, 2022?
· Industry / Technology
­ What we want to know: Will the chip shortage end anytime soon?
 Will average semiconductor chip lead times (amount of time between order and delivery) drop to below 15 weeks at any point before July 1, 2022?
· Technical / Incident
­ What we want to know: Is it a good idea to increasingly rely on commercial online identity services? (The IRS seemed to think so!)  Will it be publicly reported that a popular online identity verification service was breached in 2022?

#RSAC
Preliminary Analysis What are we already seeing?
· By subject
­ Clear geopolitical interest ­ A complexity limit for public platforms? · By participants ­ Unofficially - SMEs doing well? · A bonus for longer timelines? · Some mistakes! (Of course) ­ Timing glitch ­ The unexpected

#RSAC
Toward the Future
· Finish the real-world beta test · Report out results · Operationalize if warranted · Join us: https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/white-hat/
