SHORT TONS TRANSPORTED VIA WATER IN 2017 BY COMMODITY GROUP

#RSAC
The inland and coastal waterway system is a critical component for the safe, efficient, and secure transportation of raw materials, energy, consumer goods, and other commodities that impact our everyday lives.
The protection of these systems is critical to commerce moving in North America.

How the MTS Supports Safety & Efficiency

One Tanker =

5 Inland 15Barge Tows

1,080 Rail Cars + 30 Locomotives

5,250 Semi Tractor-Trailers

One tanker carries the tonnage equivalent
to several common inland barge tows or
thousands of rail cars or trucks.

Waterways are the most efficient way of transporting everyday products ­ from petroleum, grain, coal, and farm products to steel, sand, chemicals, and other building supplies ­ across the country.

which mainly impacted Maersk Line, APM Terminals and Damco. Business

volumes were negatively affected for a couple of weeks in July and as a

consequence, our Q3 results will be impacted. We expect the cyber-attack will

impact results negatively by USD 200-300m."

NIST Liquified Natural Gas Cybersecurity Framework Profile

#RSAC
DOE CESER Project Goals: · Cybersecurity
Framework Profile focused on Liquified Natural Gas within the Marine Transportation System · Enhance Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation Guidance including updating mappings of DOE's Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (v2.0) to the Cybersecurity Framework (v1.1)

#RSAC

Oil and Natural Gas make up 55 percent of global energy use today. The U.S. Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) industry has grown dramatically in recent years. The American Petroleum Institute projects LNG exports would be a 75billion-dollar industry to the U.S. GDP by 2035.

As more crucial technical operations of the LNG lifecycle become fully automated, the need for heightened cybersecurity readiness is necessary to ensure personnel safety, national security interests and environmental safety concerns. This LNG Profile will: · Inform actions to enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture · Guide gap analyses of the existing cyber environment · Support refinement of cybersecurity policies and guidelines

The CSF Profile
A Cybersecurity Framework Profile is nonregulatory and voluntary guidance that helps identify opportunities for managing cybersecurity risks in a specific industry, trade or organization. The Profile leverages industry-driven expertise to identify Mission Objectives critical to operations and cybersecurity program priorities. The Profile creates a roadmap to align requirements, risk appetite, resources and objectives that are weighed against the Framework Core.
What's Next?
The Profile development team is striving to evolve the use of a CSF Profile to include assessment toolsets, a visual risk dashboard and other dynamic features that will allow organizations to better leverage the efforts of building your custom Profile. Your Profile will be easier to navigate and allow a more expeditious identification of risk control and mitigation procedures.

Apply What You Have Learned Today

#RSAC

Next week you should:
­ Familiarize yourself with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. ­ Determine how your organization applies enterprise risk management and relevant
guiding doctrine? (consider NISTIR 8286 Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) ­ What is the cybersecurity policy landscape and appetite of your organization?
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Identify application opportunities of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and specifically a CSF Profile.
Within six months you should:
­ Identify correct organizational players to build a CSF Profile. ­ Create an organizational CSF Profile and establish organization priorities for
cybersecurity risk management.
