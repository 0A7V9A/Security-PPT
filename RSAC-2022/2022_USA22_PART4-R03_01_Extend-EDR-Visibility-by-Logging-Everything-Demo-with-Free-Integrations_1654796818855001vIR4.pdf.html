Logging Problem
A more general lesson: How do you calculate TCO for a set of logs? How to cut costs of logging?
Don't log it Reduce retention Sample (e.g. metrics) Assessment (e.g. alerts)

Close the Loop
Hypothesis -> ad hoc searching Theory -> Automated alerting High confidence theory -> Priority Alerting Proven Theory -> Automated remediation

Tines
Tines Community Edition! if you're familiar with the APIs you use, Tines will dramatically speed up developing automated alerts and remediation.
Caveats SOAR presents a lot of organizational challenges. It's own learning curve Power tool

Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Sign up for Humio Community Edition! ­ Sign up for Corelight @ Home! ­ Sign up for Tines Community Edition!
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Review your TCO calculations for which logs you might need to investigate in the future. ­ If you have low confidence in these decisions, experiment.
­ Consider more raw telemetry ­ coalitions with other teams to share costs.
