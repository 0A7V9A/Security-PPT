Project Goal

Identify the 10 most important technical and organizational privacy risks for web applications

Provide transparency about privacy risks (legal, reputational, financial, but also risks for freedom)

Independent from "local" laws based on OECD Privacy Principles

Show countermeasures Educate developers, business architects and legal Not in scope: Self-protection for users

1. Limitation of Collection 2. Data Quality 3. Specification of the Purpose 4. Use Limitation 5. Security 6. Transparency 7. Individual Participation 8. Accountability

Privacy in DevSecOps

Privacy is everyone's problem and split into organizational and technical topics Some decisions must be taken before DevSecOps ­ or maybe DevPrivOps? Split responsibilities make privacy challenging (legal, architects, developers) Establish a process to consider privacy from the product idea to its deployment

P1: Web Application Vulnerabilities

Explanation: Vulnerability is a key problem in any system that guards or operates on sensitive user data. Failure to suitably design and implement an application, detect a problem or promptly apply a fix (patch) is likely to result in a privacy breach.

Risk Mitigation: Train developers regarding web application security Apply secure coding guidelines Perform security source code scans (SAST, DAST) and penetration tests (e.g. based on OWASP Top 10) Use up-to-date software libraries (server, DB, libs)? Install updates, patches and hotfixes on a regular basis (application, server, DB, etc) Don't forget to secure test data if it contains (real) personal data

Note: The colored process steps show where this risk should be mainly mitigated

#RSAC
P2: Operator-sided Data Leakage

Explanation: Failure to prevent the leakage of any information containing or related to user data, or the data itself, to any unauthorized party resulting in loss of data confidentiality. Introduced either due to intentional malicious breach or unintentional mistake.
Risk Mitigation:
Request appropriate security controls from your operator like Awareness campaigns, Encryption of personal data, Identity & Access Management, strong Anonymization or Pseudonymization, etc.
Assess and/or audit the operator (before signing the contract or using it): ­ Research the reputation and reliability of the operator ­ Request self-assessment or perform on-site audit ­ Request certification like ISO 27001, SOC2 Report, Cloud Provider Security Assessment

#RSAC
P3: Insufficient Data Breach Response

Explanation: Not informing the affected persons (users) about a possible breach or data leak, resulting either from intentional or unintentional events; failure to remedy the situation by fixing the cause; not attempting to limit the leaks.
Risk Mitigation: Create an Incident Response Plan including procedures to inform persons affected by a data breach Regularly test incident response procedures and establish a CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) Maintain a Software BOM (Bill of Material) that includes release versions of all libraries in use Prepare for software updates and patching (e.g. document code, retain developer knowledge) Monitor for incidents / data leakage by connecting a SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) tool

P4: Consent on Everything *New*
Explanation: Aggregation or inappropriate use of consent to legitimate processing of personal data. Consent is "on everything" and not collected separately for each purpose (e.g. use of website and profiling for advertising).
Risk Mitigation: Collect consent separately for each purpose (e.g. different checkboxes for use of website and profiling for advertising). Consent must be traceable and audit-proof Consent should be voluntarily Helen Nissenbaum on Post-Consent Privacy - YouTube

P5: Non-transparent Policies, Terms & Conditions

Explanation: Not providing sufficient information to describing how user data is processed, such as its collection, storage, and processing. Failure to make this information easily-accessible and understandable for non-lawyers.

Risk Mitigation:
Policies, terms and conditions should be:
­ Easy to find and understandable for non-lawyers ­ Fully describe data processing (which data is collected, for what purpose, ...) ­ In the user's language ­ Complete, but KISS (Keep it short and simple)
A short version of the T&Cs and pictograms can be used for easier understanding Use release notes to identify change history of T&Cs and policies/notices over time Deploy Do Not Track (W3C standard) and provide Opt-out

P6: Insufficient Deletion of Personal Data

Explanation: Failure to effectively and/or timely delete personal data after termination of the specified purpose or upon request.

Risk Mitigation: Consider data retention or deletion policies / agreements and evaluate their appropriateness Delete personal data after termination of specified purpose (1-6 months is good practice, consider retention periods) Implement option to delete data on rightful user request Design your application to also consider deletion of copies, backups and interfaces to third parties Delete user profiles after longer period of inactivity

P7: Insufficient Data Quality *New*

Explanation: The use of outdated, incorrect or bogus user data. Failure to update or correct the data.

Risk Mitigation: Perform integrity checks where appropriate Provide an update form or other ways for the user to update his/her data Ask user if his/her data is still correct (e.g. "Please verify your shipping address") Forward updated data to third parties / subsystems that received the user's data before Question how long it is likely that data is up to date and how often it usually changes Important note: This risk shows that data integrity is part of data privacy

P8: Missing or Insufficient Session Expiration
Explanation: Failure to effectively enforce session termination. May result in collection of additional userdata without the user's consent or awareness.
Risk Mitigation: User sessions must be terminated automatically depending on the criticality of the application (e.g. banking vs. search engine) Option: Provide user-defined logout period after X hours / days Provide an obvious logout button (easy to find) Educate users

P9: Inability of users to access and modify data
Explanation: Users do not have the ability to access, change or delete data related to them.
Risk Mitigation: Provide easy-to-use ways to access, change or delete user data Design an appropriate data structure model to handle user rights This risk has some synergies / overlaps with P7 Insufficient Data Quality

P10: Collection of data not required for the user-consented purpose
Explanation: Collecting descriptive, demographic or any other user-related data that are not needed for the purposes of the system. Applies also to data for which the user did not provide consent.
Risk Mitigation: Define purpose of the collection Only collect personal data required to fulfill this purpose Notify and ask individuals if purpose or processing is changed Data minimization ­ only collect and store user data that is necessary Provide option to collect additional data voluntarily to improve service (e.g. product recommendation, personal advertisement)

Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
­ Check the status of integration of privacy in your development processes
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Consult and integrate stakeholders (business, architects, legal) because privacy is not a technical-only topic
­ Identify gaps regarding privacy in your processes and products considering the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks
­ Check if the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks are mitigated by measures
Within six months you should:
­ Address gaps and integrate privacy in your development process (Privacy by Design) ­ Train developers and apply privacy patterns and best practices to reduce risks
