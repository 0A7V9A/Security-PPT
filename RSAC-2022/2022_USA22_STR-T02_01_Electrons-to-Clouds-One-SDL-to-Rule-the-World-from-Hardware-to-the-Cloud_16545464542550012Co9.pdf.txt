#RSAC
Supply Chain and SDL
We can't talk about full-stack SDL without supply chain security The majority of organizations don't own the full-stack
­ Even if you think you do, you are still impacted by supply chain SDL.
We must expand SDL scope to suppliers and vendors
­ Today, the industry relies on a contract-based approach. ­ We can benefit as an industry with a baseline full-stack SDL. ­ There are many industry SDL frameworks, but they tend to have a focused
scope. None really provide a comprehensive full-stack approach.
34

#RSAC
Human Element ­ Culture Shift

The same approach for shifting security culture works across software, firmware, hardware and technology incubation teams.
A key aspect is helping teams recognize and understand SDL impacts in other areas.

Our previous RSAC talk discusses SDL culture shift and how to mature the security culture of an organization.

35

Key Takeaways
Can one SDL rule the world?
­ Yes, with Full-Stack SDL ­ But it involves more than just one team, product,
organization
Why Full-Stack SDL?
­ The vulnerabilities will happen at the weakest SDL link
Lower layers (foundational security) secure the higher layers Lower layers are less agile
­ Mind the Gap
Your SDL should overlap where different technologies overlap Gaps between the different SDL layers need to be addressed with a full-stack SDL approach

Applying To Your Organization ­ Immediate Steps
Got SDL?
­ Take a look at our previous RSA talk:
­ Dude, You're Getting a Dell: Organizational Culture Shift to SDL Maturity
What does SDL mean for your organization
­ Evaluate your organization's needs ­ Assess the gaps
What is your product portfolio
­ Does your organization span the technology stacks (SW, FW, HW)? ­ Does your organization rely on 3rd party components across these layers?
39

#RSAC
Applying To Your Organization ­ Short Term
Establish or expand your organization's SDL requirements based on the needs and gaps identified.
Pull together all development, architecture and technology incubation teams for full-stack SDL coverage
­ It needs to be a collaborative effort because different parts of the organization understand their specific business needs, product risks, security profile and risk tolerance.
­ It is vital to have these representatives participating to build a comprehensive full-stack SDL.
Include procurement / supplier management to help expand SDL to your 3rd party suppliers, vendors and strategic partners.
40

#RSAC
Applying To Your Organization ­ Long Term
Define and implement processes and controls to execute SDL activities based on your defined standards. Don't forget to include the deployment and training needed to enable your teams. This is a journey
­ Developing a full-stack SDL process takes time.
Review evolving needs / requirements
­ Continue iterating on SDL on a regular cadence ­ Once full-stack SDL is established and rolled out keep up with emerging industry
threats, business needs and new technology stacks.
41

#RSAC
Applying To The Industry ­ Transforming SDL

Time to transform our industry with a Full-Stack SDL
­ Consider industry standards
Start the conversation
Get involved
Talk to suppliers and partners
Incorporate standardized SDL
­ Your Org ­ Partners ­ Suppliers
