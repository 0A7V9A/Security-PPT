ииии

The 2021 (ISC)▓ Cybersecurity Workforce Study found that the supply of cybersecurity professionals globally grew 700k in 2021. However, the need for cybersecurity professionals increased in 2021. [CLICK] And while the workforce gap decreased slightly from 3.1 million to 2.7 million, we're nowhere close to out of the woods. The gap actually increased in all parts of the world except Asia. Our data suggests the global cybersecurity workforce needs to grow at least 65% to effectively defend organizations' critical assets.

Log4j Impact

Nearly half of cybersecurity teams gave up holiday time and weekends to assist with remediation.

About one in four organizations was less secure during Log4j remediation and fell behind on their 2022 security priorities.

" We need more [personnel] to put in the extra hours when there is a disclosure, to avoid burning people out and deprioritizing day-to-day security work."

Q How much of an impact do each of the following have on closing the cybersecurity workforce gap? Please rank each initiative based on its impact towards the goal of completely reducing the cybersecurity workforce gap. CHART SHOWS TOP RANKING %s When asked to rank the impact various elements have on closing the cybersecurity workforce gap, participants ranked staffing elements at the top. 42% of respondents ranked development and retention of existing staff as having the greatest impact on shrinking the cybersecurity workforce gap. This was followed by initiatives aimed at recruiting new staff (31%) and encouraging the development of future staff (23%). 17% cited the use of AI/ML and automation in cybersecurity operations. This and other data signal that while important, cybersecurity professionals do not view technology investments alone as an adequate proxy for more people doing the work.

Where is your gap? Ask the right questions to find out.

What core skills do you lack?

Are your team members able to specialize, or is it all hands on deck?

When a major vulnerability surfaces, how well do you respond?

How has your attack surface changed with remote work?

Where do you anticipate your needs 1, 2 or 3 years from now?

Do you know enough about how your organization is evolving?

What does it take to succeed on your team, and is that realistic?

Help Wanted: Talented people with the potential to succeed. Deep IT experience not always required.

We are starting to see a shift with how people enter their cybersecurity career.



The industry is already seeing this trend take shape. That belief is backed up by our 2021 Cybersecurity Workforce Study, which found that more than 50% of all cybersecurity professionals now come from backgrounds outside of IT. This rate is higher among younger professionals. This hints at a major shift that is much more inclusive and not limited only to the traditional career paths into the profession. It signals a change in hiring and recruiting practices that are more open to candidates with other transferable skills and attributes.

и

When it comes to understanding what attracts jobseekers to the cybersecurity profession, we can see that the opportunity for problem solving tops the list, but it's also about the industry's skills shortage.

и

They understand that there is a large gap and low unemployment in this industry, and that career advancement opportunities may exist as a result.

и

As we've seen in past research, high salaries are not the top factor that makes people pursue a career in cybersecurity, and respondents typically indicate they are more interested in the mission of protecting people and solving problems.

и

So we are attracting a certain type of individual who may be more altruistic than average.

Want to make an impact in your organization? Recruit entry- and junior-level team members.

We need to meet them

where they are.

ииApprenticeships Apprenticeships give entry-level professionals the ability to try multiple functions under the cybersecurity umbrella. Example: Siemens Energy has a four-year apprenticeship program, dubbed the Cybersecurity & Industrial Infrastructure Security Apprenticeship Program (CIISAp), specifically geared toward addressing the workforce gap in critical infrastructure security

[CLICK] Paid internships

While less structured than apprenticeships, internships provide opportunities for those with other commitments, such as education, another job or caregiving.

How have entryor junior-level cybersecurity team members helped your organization?

"Sometimes a fresh look at these old situations helps us identify problems we overlooked before."

"They're often well versed on the newest innovations, even more so than some of our established senior contributors, while lacking skills to support their curiosity, and it creates excellent synergy."

"They take on a lot of the day-to-day work to free up senior people for more technical work."

Establishing a new baseline. Introducing a path into the cybersecurity profession that welcomes a diversity of experience and builds a shared core of skills.



The industry needs a recognized, global measure for skills verification and baseline understanding of the core cybersecurity domains that provide candidates with confidence and employers with a level of assurance that a candidate has the foundational knowledge, skills and abilities needed for an entry-level or junior cybersecurity position. Bringing students, young professionals and career changers into cybersecurity careers at an entry level and setting them up on a pathway to success is essential for creating the growth the industry so desperately needs. Attract more diverse individuals that come from different backgrounds
