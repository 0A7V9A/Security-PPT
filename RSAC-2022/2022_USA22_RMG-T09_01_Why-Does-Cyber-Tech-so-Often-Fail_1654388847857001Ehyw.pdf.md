· Incentives: compliance, `sticking with the herd', first-mover disadvantages of additional cost and time
· Resources: tight
· Information: relying heavily on peers, vendors and limited assessment
· Time-pressure: pressure to solve urgent, short-term problems

Se cu rity ve n d o rs are d rive n b y the fo llo wing characte ristics o f the curre nt m arke t:
· Incentives: avoid first-mover disadvantage of `over'-investing in efficacy
· Innovation-stifled: lack of efficacy transparency
· Crowding: intense competition means excessively bold claims
· Transparency: fear vulnerability identification and IP loss
