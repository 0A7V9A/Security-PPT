Why it's worthwhile to manage risk beyond audit compliance and do so while working as a team

#RSAC
How intelligence informs strategic security priorities and reduces uncertainty

#RSAC
"The question has shifted from `How much is enough?' (Gordon and Loeb's 2002 model) to `Where and when to invest?' Uncertainty also plays a key role in the timing of security investments, having an effect on the choice of proactive and reactive protection measures."
­ Economic aspects of national cyber security strategies (Brangetto & Aubyn, 2015)

Intelligence Fusion Happens Every Day in Our Security Activities

#RSAC
· Impacts end-users before SOC is aware · Users contact help desk · Help desk lacks escalation path · No incident response playbook · Unclear operational impacts · Crisis communications · Brand impacts

#RSAC
· Innumerable vulnerabilities exist · Identifying exploitable technology
is difficult · Unclear how to prioritize patching · Business justification difficulties · Operational impacts
48

#RSAC
· Who do you trust? · Is this request legitimate? · Re-used Credentials · Few boundaries between work and
personal computing environments · Exposed Credentials are prevalent · No honor among thieves

#RSAC
· What is my exposure? · Difficulty identifying problems early · Should I trust this credential? · Huge volumes to deal with · Business process disruption and cost · Client dissatisfaction
50

#RSAC
· Access to privileged information · Frequently connect from unsecured
locations · Strapped for time · Impersonation to gain access to
confidential information · Bad-guys take advantage of social media

#RSAC
· Third parties provide a gateway into the network
· What is my exposure? · Difficulty identifying problems early · Difficult to assess their security posture · Not always disclosed when they
