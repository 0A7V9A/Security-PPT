Connecticut Public Act No. 21-119
An Act Incentivizing the Adoption of Cybersecurity Standards for Business--AKA The Cybersecurity Standards Act
Two Assumptions:
­ Cybersecurity is largely VOLUNTARY; and ­ Political non-starter to create a statutory minimum standard of
Conclusion: we need to INCENTIVIZE the voluntary adoption of cyber best practices

Connecticut's Cybersecurity Standards Act
Clear requirements to EARN incentive:
­ (A) Protect the security and confidentiality of such information; ­ (B) Protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and ­ (C) Protect against unauthorized access to and acquisition of the information that would result in a
material risk of identity theft.
Flexible scale and scope:
­ (A) The size and complexity of the covered entity; ­ (B) the nature and scope of the activities of the covered entity; ­ (C) the sensitivity of the information to be protected; and ­ (D) the cost and availability of tools to improve information security and reduce vulnerabilities
Industry frameworks for guidance:
­ The NIST framework, codified by Congress; and ­ The CIS Critical Security Controls, being adopted by industry (e.g., the Defense & Aerospace
Industry; several U.S. states (e.g., Ohio & Utah); and around the world.

Benefits and Challenges of Incentive-Based Cybersecurity Laws
What are the advantages/disadvantages of an incentivebased approach vs a mandatory law? How does the incorporation of risk frameworks like the CIS controls help organizations develop a practical and defensibly "reasonable" cybersecurity program? Can small businesses implement "compliant" programs?

#RSAC
A Security Framework or Program should help you
How do I choose the most effective actions (based on data)? How do I get started? Is there an "on ramp"? How do I prioritize action? How do I measure progress; how do I compare to others? What value is there in what I already own (and do)? How do I learn from others? Where can I get training? How much can I automate? What vendors support this? How can I be sure? How does this relate to other frameworks?

Hypotheticals
Cloud-based business based OH seeks advice on "complying" with the ODPA using CIS framework. Same business experiences a data breach resulting from a vulnerability that was identified as low risk during the risk assessment process. What happens under the ODPA? CT? Same business experiences a data breach resulting from a failure to adhere to the security program it developed. What happens under the ODPA? CT?
