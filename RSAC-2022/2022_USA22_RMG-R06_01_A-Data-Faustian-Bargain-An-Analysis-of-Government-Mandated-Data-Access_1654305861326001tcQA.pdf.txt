Data as a Source of Power

Shifting notions of power due to confluence of cyber & emerging
tech

In the past: power measured by military personnel, spending, iron
and steel production, etc.

Mastering the 4 Vs of data (velocity, volume, variety, and
veracity)

Power diffusion: thanks to the rapid pace of technological
change and diminished price (or even open source) of digital
capabilities, small countries or groups can have over-sized global
impact

Data as an asset: Protection, loss, or manipulation of data can have
financial, reputational, or existential implications for
organizations

#RSAC
A Brief Story of the Data Faustian Bargain:
For 50 years, supply chains were designed to be cost-effective, but not resilient or secure. Organizations deprioritized security and resilience for market access. Global trade increasingly became digitized, leaving data at risk across the globe as governments increasingly demand data sovereignty within their borders.

Suppliers in Hundreds (if not Thousands) of Global Locations

#RSAC
Almost 1000 companies have fled Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, leaving assets and data exposed

#RSAC
The Geography of Data Protection and Data at Risk
и Borders do exist on the internet и Global businesses and their supply chains face very
different data risks due to government access to data и Where is data better protected and where is it most at risk?

The Rule Setters

China

European Union

Cybersecurity Law
Г Since 2015, series of laws focused on cyber sovereignty, internet controls, state access to data or technical support to authorities, security standards
Latest Five-Year Plan emphasizes tech self-reliance, data localization and government influence over data Personal Information Protection Law:
Г Came into effect November 1, mirrors GDPR but does not stop government access to data

General Data Protection Regulation
и Focused on transparency, security, minimalization, purpose limitation, accountability, strict standards for data transfer outside of EU
Recent discussions of banning facial recognition in public spaces

#RSAC
Just a Few of the Regulatory Shifts in 2021
Botswana
Г The 2018 data privacy law was put into effect in October 2021
Ecuador
Г A draft approved by the national assembly on May 10, 2021 and enacted on May 26, 2021
United Arab Emirates
Г The UAE Cabinet enacted a new personal data protection law on 28 November 2021
Brazil
Г Personal data protection to become fundamental right
Belarus
Г A new data privacy law was signed on May 2021 and enacted November 2021 Г Includes definition of personal data, consent to process and collect data, process for cross-border transfers, liability for breaches, and creation
of oversight body  Dramatic reduction over the past year in restricted Internet access, social media surveillance, and deadly force against online activists
17

#RSAC
And a Few More.....
Indonesia
Г Court rules that the government can block internet data during unrest, and tightens MR5 Regulation requiring compliance to government requests for data
OECD
Г Members split on government access to personal data (Australia, Canada, Japan, the U.K., and U.S. support "obliged access")
Government Use of Spyware
Г India: Top court investigates illegal surveillance, including government use of spyware against citizens
Г France: Final stages of contract negotiations to purchase spyware until officials learned it had been used to target French politicians
Г At least 18 governments have been linked to Pegasus spyware

While some information is available from security and privacy

sources, more expansive sourcing is necessary, including human rights

and `ease of doing business' research

Unstructured to Structured Text
Each question aligned and coded such that low scores reflected less data protection/more invasive government intervention while higher scores reflected more data protection/less invasive government intervention Core areas:
Г Data storage Г Restrictions on government access to data Г Data protection law and independent oversight Г Source code disclosure requirements Г Joint venture requirements
Global Coverage: 189 countries or territories

Г Transparency over access to data

#RSAC
Trends: The Good
Over 100 countries with data protection laws
Г Many more have passed but are not yet enacted
Accountability on the rise
Г Data protection laws in one country/region are changing behavior elsewhere Г Fines and regulatory action may be at tipping point to prioritize data protection
Growing global societal interest and movement for data protection
28

#RSAC
Trends: The Bad
If you can't block them....
Г Censorship as a precursor to data access requirements
Gaps between law and reality
Г Identifying scandals that demonstrate lack of adherence to data protection laws
The rise of the rest
Г Copycat laws and policies across all regions
Greater interference around elections
Growing use of unchecked surveillance technologies

And the Data Traps

#RSAC

"If you allow another country to gain access to really critical data about your society, over time that will erode your sovereignty, you no longer have control over that data." MI6 Chief Richard Moore

#RSAC
Building Resilience Against Data Traps
Do Government Regulations Involve...
Data protection and privacy? Г Is there an independent data protection authority? National Security Exceptions? Г Is there judicial review and guardrails? Г Is the definition overly vague? Local data storage? Г Are your products and services (or those across your
partners and supply chains) impacted by localization? Г Is your data subject to localization laws? Г Is there rule of law and data protections? Joint ventures with local firms? Turning over source code?
35

#RSAC
What about your suppliers?

#RSAC
What to do Next: Minimizing the Data Faustian Bargain
Next week
Г Integrate stakeholders from across the organization to assess what data may be at risk (including procurement, privacy, people operations, etc.)
Г This needs to be an iterative process that starts immediately but continues on a regular cadence
First Six Months
Г Evaluate data access and protection policies when assessing corporate global footprint Г Evaluate data access and protection policies when assessing supply chain partners Г Explore the costs (e.g., potential data loss) and benefits (e.g., market access, labor, data protection) of
each global location
Within Six to Twelve Months
Г Ensure corporate data policies integrate the potential risks of a `data at risk' regulatory environment, including data minimalization, seizure, and data storage requirements
Г Maintain regular cross-departmental `data at risk' reviews for all stakeholders to promote collaboration and permanently eliminate internal data silos Include cost/benefit updates of geographic footprint
Г Integrate updated reviews on any shifts in the global data regulatory environment
