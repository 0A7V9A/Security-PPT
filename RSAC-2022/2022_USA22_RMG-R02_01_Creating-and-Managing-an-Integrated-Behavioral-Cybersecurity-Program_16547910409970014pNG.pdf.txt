Creating and Implementing a Behavioral Cybersecurity Program
Ira Winkler
Chief Security Architect Walmart @irawinkler

#RSAC
What is Behavioral Cybersecurity?
Poorly defined Roughly the implementation of behavioral science, psychology, and cognitive science to enhance cybersecurity programs At first glance, it is about security awareness It can, and should, be much more
2

#RSAC
What Should Behavioral Cybersecurity Be?
End user behavioral risk reduction
­ Awareness and otherwise
Customer sentiment, as appropriate Improving cybersecurity professional practices Improving wellness of the professional staff Research of relevant principles
3

#RSAC
Why a Discipline?
Too much Bro-science out there It is more than reading Cialdini or BJ Fogg, or taking an NLP class Behavioral science is an established discipline Involves research and training User experience is as, maybe more, important as psychological gimmicks Tremendous benefit to be realized beyond awareness
4

#RSAC
End-User Behavior Improvement
5

#RSAC
Security Awareness
Statistical analysis of campaign effectiveness Determining how to implement scientific principles into awareness programs Improving phishing assessments through metrics and behavioral principles Looking to additional methods of awareness delivery
6

#RSAC
Implementing Gamification
More than a game Reward system to reward behaviors in practice Understand how to reward people Determine what to reward Tracking points Modifying program based on results
7

#RSAC
User Experience
Leading people to make better decisions regardless of awareness Nudges to make better decisions Modifying interfaces to improve behaviors Statistical analysis to determine where user failings happen Determining data accesses and permissions to provide and reduce Process improvement See You Can Stop Stupid or Human Security Engineering presentations
8

#RSAC
Procedure Improvement
Analyze end user functions to embed cybersecurity practices Optimize practices to simplify and reduce errors Definition of practices within procedures and guidelines Promote the proper practices
Awareness should be how to do work properly, not what to be afraid of
9

#RSAC
Human Incident Response
Why did the incident happen? Why did the user initiate loss? What were the awareness failings? What were the systematic failings? Plan and implement countermeasures
10

#RSAC
Customer Sentiment
11

#RSAC
Who Are Your Customers?
Beyond your users B2C B2B
12

#RSAC
User Experience
Is your security user friendly? Is your password policy a nightmare? Does the experience provide a perception of security?
13

#RSAC
Providing Enhanced Security
Going beyond the purpose Provide resources to enhance overall security Tools Knowledge
14

#RSAC
Public Relations
Promote what you're doing
15

#RSAC
Improving Cybersecurity Practices
16

#RSAC
Where Can You Enhance Practices?
Where are bad cybersecurity decisions made? Where can decisions making be improved? Where can practices be improved?
17

#RSAC
18

#RSAC
User Experience
Cybersecurity tool usability How is information displayed? Reducing information presented to cybersecurity professionals Analysis of error rates Optimizing information displays
19

#RSAC
Training and Certification
What training is required to improve performance? Certifications? Tracking and mapping of skills Guiding for career progression Guiding for team needs Soft skills? Looking forward
20

#RSAC
Recruiting
Determining needs Positioning organization and cybersecurity team Identifying candidates Rating candidates Streamlining hiring process
21

#RSAC
Improving Professional Wellness
22

#RSAC
A Widely Known Problem
Burnout Stress Anxiety
23

#RSAC
Addressing the Issues
Implementing employee wellness targeted to cybersecurity personnel Meditation training Scheduling of events to alleviate stress Regular wellness checks
24

#RSAC
Research
25

#RSAC
Depends Where it is Needed
Determine shortfalls Look into funding university and other research programs that have potential Science exists that needs to be brought into practice Culture Enhanced awareness Behavior modification Error reduction
26

#RSAC
Logistics
27

#RSAC
Staff Composition
Data scientists
­ First by intent
Programmers Project managers Behavioral scientists Doctoral researchers Awareness practitioners Trainers

#RSAC
Training
The disciplines identified Communications skills Research methodologies Data science Statistical analysis
29

#RSAC
Partnerships
Human Resources Physical Security Employee Wellness Awareness Training Operations Data Science Others as logical
30

#RSAC
Putting it All Together
31

#RSAC
Create an Umbrella
Some efforts likely being implemented Many efforts should be part of the general CISO function
­ Almost a Chief of Staff function
Consolidate tracking of what exists under the program See what's working and what isn't Be mindful of internal politics
32

#RSAC
Determine Available Resources
Who do you have available? What level of funding do you have? Do you have the relationships in place to execute what you need? What resources beyond funding are available? What is your skillset?
33

#RSAC
Choosing the Projects
Where is the best use of your resources? Where is the most visible impact to be made? Where will you have the least resistance? Can you make the most use of the effort? Finite or ongoing?
34

#RSAC
Always Collect Metrics
Measure all efforts in all categories
­ See my books for metrics
Behavioral science is treated like Bro-science too often Implement scientific rigor to prove value, OR stop wasting money Prove your value, as incidents will happen Justify your existence
35

#RSAC
"Apply" Slide
Next week you should:
­ Identify relevant efforts that qualify as Behavioral Cybersecurity
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Determine if you can create an umbrella for your efforts ­ Identify potential efforts beyond awareness to pursue ­ Seek support and funding
Within six months you should:
­ Create a common dashboard for efforts under your umbrella ­ Compile Day 0 metrics to show your future impact ­ Begin an additional effort; even minor, like Human Incident Response procedures
