Hindsight is 2020

In Scope
NIST Risk Management Framework. Psychology and the pandemic. Suggestions on how to improve risk management.

Out of Scope
This is not a replacement of risk management fundamentals.
This is not a search for a silver lining in the pandemic.
This is not a medical science talk. I will make simplifications during this talk.

The Human Experience of Risk
Risk tolerance varies by the person asking or person deciding Perception of risk influenced by salience and availability biases Decision-making prefers certainty while risk delivers uncertainty Relationships, trust, personal experiences outperform statistics

The Human Experience of Risk
We teach risk as a function of quantifiable measures
­ { (confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact) }
People experience risk qualitatively, driven by perception
­ (hazard, outrage)
Decisions like categorization are not black-and-white

The Human Experience of Risk
Risk habituation fuels resistance to change Facts don't change minds, stories do People have a finite capacity for absorbing new changes People have a limited ability to focus on changing (50-150 days) Awareness training can't overcome barriers

Implementation should focus on:
­ Capability ­ can they do it? ­ Motivation ­ do they want to do it? ­ Opportunity ­ what's blocking them?

When Work Looks Like Work, Work Gets Done.
Messaging which looks like we expect is more effective messaging

Recap
We have a good idea of what our workforce needs to be secure. We have some behaviors they need to follow. Yet time and again, our approaches fail. The pandemic provided a unique opportunity to see how this problem plays out in other fields. Draw lessons for security while the pandemic is still a fresh and shared experience.

Practical Steps towards Human-centered Risk Management
Next week you should:
­ Identify areas of the risk management program that have stalled or failed to gain support ­ Workshop these areas looking for salience, habituation, resistance, misinformation ­ Perform a stakeholder analysis and find any low trust relationships
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Adjust conversation on risk to better align with the psychology of risk ­ Put in place a cadence with low trust stakeholders ­ manage the relationships ­ Change from risk appetite to a risk menu ­ specific scenarios supported by data ­ Shift risk treatment and control implementation to focus on lifecycle events
Within six months you should:
­ Change reporting on risk treatment to emphasize story over statistics ­ manage the story ­ Evaluate risk assessment and treatment results, collect lessons learned ­ Expand the approach into other areas of the risk management program
