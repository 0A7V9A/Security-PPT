Protecting Your Company from the Company It Keeps
 Business is increasingly interconnected and interdependent via software.
 The bad guys have figured that out. So have the regulators.
 The "app cloud" exacerbates that trend, with additional levels of "parties."
 Merger and acquisition success depends on cybersecurity levels.
 Software security/quality is a key factor in business success.
