Apply Actions for Diversity
You hold the power of moving this conversation forward a little at a time.

Immediate Action: Listen
Immediate actions are not always mind blowing or filled
with consensus. I find it helpful to genuinely hear the
concerns or unwillingness others have before taking the
next step.

Next Steps: Build Consensus
This is where it is important to find common ground within
community. I want to hear from the detractors but give more of a platform to the optimistic in
the crowd.

Long-Term Game Plan: Implementation
After hearing concerns and optimism from the team, I take the next most logical step in the right direction. This is
open ended because communities vary widely in
their needs.

The Problem
Current data points

#RSAC
We need to tackle a system of bullying and exploitation.

#RSAC
A diverse slate includes two or more candidates from any underrepresented group.
Research shows that when only one woman or one Black person is included in a slate of finalists, there is statistically zero chance
they will be hired --but when two such candidates are included, the chance that
one of them will be hired rises dramatically.

Nearly 20 percent of U.S. workers have experienced religious discrimination in the workplace.

There is a lack of published research that shares any data on the following groups in tech & security: Non-binary Neurodiverse BIPOC Religion Trans

Expectations after signing the pledge: Within six months, we require a virtual check-in that will ask for an update.
After 1 year: · Verification of positive change · Verification of criteria met · Ranked list of companies · Revisited everywhere
Over time: · Evidence of retention in leadership roles across tech · Evidence of retention across junior tech roles · Better pay for all individuals · Higher growth and recognition across the board

Why Diversity Is Better Than The Status Quo
THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS WILL UNDERSTAND REPRESENTATION AND INCLUSION FOR ALL
We don't have to wait for experts to save us. This work impacts everyone, including people who do not own a marginalized
identity. We ALL benefit from working in spaces that understand and value EVERYONE'S individuality.

Today: Listen
Immediate actions are not always mind blowing or filled
with consensus. I find it helpful to genuinely hear the
concerns or unwillingness others have before taking the
next step.

6-18 months: Build Consensus
This is where it is important to find common ground within
community. I want to hear from the detractors but give more of a platform to the optimistic in
the crowd.

Long-Term Game Plan: Implementation
After hearing concerns and optimism from the team, I take the next most logical step in the right direction. This is
open ended because communities vary widely in
their needs.
