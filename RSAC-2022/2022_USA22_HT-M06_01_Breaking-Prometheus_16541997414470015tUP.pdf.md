Help! We are Victims of a Ransomware Attack

#RSAC
Help! We are Victims of a Ransomware Attack!

#RSAC
Decryption is not a Strategy
Catastrophic attacks reveal gaps in security strategies ­ Decryption is not a strategy ­ Hope is a terrible security strategy
Post attack - First question: "Can your team decrypt the files? Can you recover the key?" ­ No....No....No
6

#RSAC
Ransomware Encryption 101
Primary intention is to get victims to pay Variety of encryption libraries and algorithms
­ Asymmetric and Symmetric algorithms
Attackers use an asymmetric algorithm (e.g., RSA) to generate a public/private key pair
· Public key (distributed) is needed for encryption · Private key (not-distributed) is needed for decryption
Public key is placed in the ransomware configuration data and distributed with the ransomware
7

#RSAC
Ransomware Encryption 101
On the system:
­ Go Fast: symmetric algorithm (e.g., AES) is used for file encryption
Random encryption key is generated at execution time and used to encrypt files Prioritize files for encryption Intermittent encryption
­ Harden:
Public key is used to encrypt the AES key used for file encryption
How do I decrypt my files?
­ You need the private key from the attacker to obtain the key(s) used for file encryption
­ They want $$$ to provide the key
8

#RSAC
Criminals make mistakes, you might find them
Solid Reverse Engineering
Reverse Engineering and research strategy
­ Identify source material Public code re-use
­ Identify weaknesses
Focus on the file encryption key and associated parameters
­ Think outside of the box
Don't try to get the private key Don't try to brute force entire key space
9

#RSAC
In Action: Applied Reverse Engineering and Research
Client had a ransomware event
­ Multiple ransomware binaries discovered across several machines ­ Encrypted files and no good backups
File submitted for analysis
­ Prometheus ransomware
Reverse Engineering of the ransomware uncovered a "flaw" in the key generation
10

#RSAC
Reversing Prometheus

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus
Needed to: First ­ Understand the ransomware behavior
­ Run in analysis environment/sandbox ­ Observe behavior
Second ­ Determine "how" exactly Prometheus encrypts files
­ Determine the encryption method ­ Work backwards to determine the inputs to the encryption algorithm and
whether we could recover them
12

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Find the Encryption
13

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Find the Initialization Vector (IV)
Uses a hardcoded initialization vector (IV) which did not change between samples
14

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Key Generation
15

Analyzing Prometheus ­ Environment.TickCount

16 #RSAC

Random() by default uses Environment.TickCount as the seed. Environment.TickCount is a 32-bit number representing the amount of time since the system started

Analyzing Prometheus ­ Environment.TickCount

17 #RSAC

Analyzing Prometheus ­ Predicting Environment.TickCount
In order to guess the key, you need a place to start. This helps limit the keyspace you need to brute force.
Take the difference between the boot time and a file timestamp
If its less than INT_MAX, no further operations are required
Otherwise, obtain the offset from INT_MIN and add it to INT_MIN.

18 #RSAC

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Decrypting Files
Did we guess the correct key?
19

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Removing the Garbage
Prometheus encrypts files in the following format:
­ <encrypted data> <base64 encoded RSA-4096 encrypted key>GotAllDone
The size of the "useless" or garbage data is constant
The size of the encrypted data can be found with the following formula:
20

#RSAC
Analyzing Prometheus ­ Decryption Optimizations
There are potential optimizations due to the seed being dependent on time. Files encrypted after another file will have a larger seed value It is possible to sort files by last write time in order to not have to continuously recalculate the potential tick count and ensure that the estimates are more accurate Seed values are relatively close to each other on each infected device
21

#RSAC
Break once, then reapply
Code reuse can be your friend

#RSAC
Break Once, Then Reapply
Malware families often reuse code (even vulnerable code) Ransomware families have similar vulnerabilities Some data is hard-coded Non-secure random number generators rely on the seed value entirely for randomness
­ Applicable to other ransomware families and multiple programming languages · C# Random, Java Random, C rand() etc.
23

#RSAC
Break once, reapply ­ Additional Decryptors

Ransomware Family Prometheus AtomSilo LockFile Bandana Chaos PartyTicket (new)

Vulnerability Used C# Random to generate keys Used time64() and rand() to generate keys Used time64() and rand() to generate keys Used C# Random to generate keys Used C# Random to generate keys Default seed value of Golang's Math.Rand() ­ generated key is constant.

24

Example ­ AtomSilo Ransomware
Uses C rand() time64() return value as the seed
­ time64() returns the seconds since the epoch, or January 1st, 1970.
You can regenerate the key assuming the seed can be guessed Replicate encryption procedure, but with decryption. AtomSilo uses intermittent encryption for speed LockFile winds up being the exact same decryption process.

25 #RSAC

Example ­ Guessing AtomSilo and LockFile time64()
AtomSilo and LockFile append a timestamp onto the name of their ransom notes
These times could be a good starting estimate
Less time to decrypt per file

26 #RSAC

#RSAC
Example ­ AtomSilo and LockFile Code Re-Use

LockFile:

AtomSilo:

27

#RSAC
Example ­ Bandana Ransomware
Like Prometheus, Bandana is written in C# Uses AES-256 to encrypt files Added a new layer ­ RFC2898DeriveBytes class In order to the obtain key, we need the "password" passed to the function RFC2898DeriveBytes()
­ Luckily "password" is generated by C#'s Random() and SHA256 hashed
28

#RSAC
Example ­ Bandana Decryption
SHA256 Hash the results of the potential "password" Pass the "password" to RFC2898DeriveBytes
­ Get the "key" and "IV"
Files are encrypted with AES-256-CBC using PKCS7 padding Decrypt file data and attempt to match to known plaintext value Key Difference
­ Only one encryption key is used to encrypt all files ­ Decrypting one file enables decrypting all other files ­ Allows for guaranteed decryption, if at least one file encrypted on the system has
known content
29

#RSAC
Example: Chaos Ransomware
Chaos ransomware is also like Prometheus
­ Hardcoded salt (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) ­ RFC2898DeriveBytes, with Random() generated password ­ AES-256-CBC encryption ­ Main difference is the File format:
"<EncryptedKey>" + <RSA encrypted RFC2898DeriveBytes password> + "<EncryptedKey>" + <Encrypted Data>
30

#RSAC
Example: PartyTicket Ransomware
Poorly implemented Ransomware uses Golang's randInt() Does not explicitly set the seed ­ remains default value ­ key generated is constant It does appear that the ransomware operators intended to set the seed value
­ Mistake: it was set after the key was generated
31

What next?
Many ransomware samples had similar key generation vulnerabilities Cryptographic algorithms and other libraries can be used to create a framework for creating decryptors Could we also standardize on the pieces needed?

32 #RSAC

#RSAC
Next Steps: Investigate Creating a Decryptor Framework
To create a decryptor that exploits key generation weaknesses:
­ Determine the encrypted file format ­ Extract the encrypted data ­ remove any junk ­ Determine the encryption algorithm ­ Determine success
Some areas of the ransomware samples will require deeper analysis
33

#RSAC
Start here...
Work the decryptor framework

Decryptor Framework­ Determine the Encrypted File Format
Requires detailed analysis
Usually consists of two parts:
­ Encrypted data ­ Symmetric key and IV
Encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm

35 #RSAC

#RSAC
Decryptor Framework ­ Determine the Encryption Algorithm
Using static or dynamic analysis Find the algorithm Follow the logic the ransomware uses to convert decrypted data to encrypted data, except use the decrypt operation for the algorithm.
­ Leads to guaranteed or potential decrypted data ­ For keys that are "guessed" there needs to be a way to verify the
decrypted data is correct.
36

Decryptor Framework ­ Determine Success
A library to match file signatures is needed for keys that are "guessed" vs. calculated If the decrypted data matches the filetype signature, it is likely correct!

37 #RSAC

#RSAC
Failures & Lessons learned
The variety of ransomware encryption methods does not allow for a one size fits all approach with creating decryptors
Even with the key vulnerabilities, files without known content are sometimes impossible to decrypt
With Prometheus, an encrypted key is appended to the file. However, because that key is encrypted with OAEP padding, it is not possible to compare the encrypted key from the file with the encrypted guessed key
Newer versions of ransomware families may fix these key generation weaknesses
Framework development and research is on-going
38

#RSAC
Applying lessons for the way ahead

#RSAC
Apply ­ Security Management
Focus on a layered approach prevention, detection and response strategy
­ No one "solution" can stop ransomware ­ Ransomware is king on the endpoint
Groups are sophisticated, stealthy, and patient Ransomware is not always about locking you out Hijacking data and extortion are the "norm" Destructive malware can evade AV long enough to execute the payload
­ Dark web markets provide these tools at relatively humble costs
40

#RSAC
Apply ­ Security Management
Prevent entry and lateral movement
­ Reduce privileged accounts ­ Segregate account privileges ­ Log admin account activity ­ Enable MFA
Reduces value of stolen or guessed passwords Reduces entry vectors
­ Baseline internal network activity
Monitor Alert on anomalous behavior
41

#RSAC
Apply ­ Security Management
Patch and hunt
­ Conduct a vulnerability assessment ­ Pen-test and Hunt to reveal potential weaknesses
Enact PowerShell and other script execution protections
­ PowerShell leveraged in multiple facets of a ransomware attack
Lateral Movement Download Execution
­ Monitor, restrict, and alert
42

#RSAC
Apply ­ Security Management
Backups - have them, test them, and keep them offline
­ Foundational best practice ­ Testing is critical ­ Offline if feasible
Read only If online - backup network should access primary (not the other way around)
Develop a response action plan
­ Prepare an IR plans and drill them
In-house expertise and/or retain a 3rd party for rapid help
­ Be able to establish temporary business functionality ­ Keep business continuity throughout investigation/remediation
43

#RSAC
Apply ­ Leverage Reverse Engineering - Can you Create a Decryptor?
Leverage Reverse Engineering as part of a response investigation
­ Look at the inner-workings and functions ­ Understand the parameters and the process ­ Can you determine how the ransomware key is generated?
If it is using hard-coded values or random numbers generated from time ­ it is worth investigating
Use knowledge from all aspects of the attack in your analysis (forensic details, timestamps etc.)
Think code reuse, vulnerable implementations that plague the original codebase (Thanos  Hakbit  Haron  Prometheus  ?)
