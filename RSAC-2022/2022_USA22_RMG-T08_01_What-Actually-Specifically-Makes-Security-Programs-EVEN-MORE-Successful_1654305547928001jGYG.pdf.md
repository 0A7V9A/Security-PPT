Security Outcomes: What does "success" look like?

Enabling vVVV the Business
Keep up with business Gain trust from execs Obtain peer buy-in Create strong culture

Managing Risk
Manage top cyber risks Meet compliance reqs Avoid major incidents Maintain biz continuity

Operating Efficiently
Run an effective program Reduce unplanned work Recruit & retain talent Streamline detection & response

#RSAC
NOTE
These top five practices had the greatest statistical likelihood of improving ALL the desired program outcomes across the board, from keeping up with the business to recruiting and retaining talent.
They helped everywhere.

Orgs would rather buy products with out-ofthe-box integrations for their core platforms...
15

#RSAC
... But it's actually better to stick with a preferred vendor for integrating security tech

Tips for MAXIMUM EFFICACY! · On-prem is OK, so long as it's
modernized and centralized · A platform approach beats a piecemeal
approach for integrated security tech · Aim to integrate all functions, but start
with what you can `Identify'

Better to insource or outsource SecOps?
Answer: Yes!

Does cyber threat intel raise our intelligence?

Bluffs of Blindness

Summit of Sagacity

Kahneman: "We're blind to our own blindness. We have very little idea of
how little we know."

Ascent of Awareness

Ravine of Reality

#RSAC
Can automation compensate for lack of talent?
Talent makes a BIG difference in low-automation scenarios
28

#RSAC
Can automation compensate for lack of talent?
Weak talent + Strong automation =
Strong talent + Weak automation

MAXIMUM
EFFICACY

Tips for MAXIMUM EFFICACY! · When investing in people, process, tech,
start with your strength then build all 3. · Outsourcing vs insourcing SecOps may
be more subjective vs objective. · You'll get more from using automation
as a supplement than a substitute. · Threat intelligence growing pains are
better than the numbness of ignorance

The best BCDR programs have Board oversight
Bonus Fact: BCDR performs best when RUN by security

#RSAC
Tips for MAXIMUM EFFICACY! · For best results, put BCDR under
security but report up to Board. · Cover ALL your assets to truly CYA
when disaster strikes. · Plan, test, test again, and break your
way to better BCDR.

Summary and takeaways
First: open up a new spreadsheet ...

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned
In the next six weeks:
­ Download the Security Outcomes Study Vol. 2 from this location: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomesstudy-vol-2.html
­ Or look at the interactive version of the full matrix here: https://cisco.com/go/securityoutcomes
­ Select outcomes that matter most to you and determine which practices might help you achieve them, and which environments apply most to your organization.
­ Send us feedback: what additional research would you like to see?

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned
In the next three months:
­ Identify the practices that you can optimize to raise your chances of success:
Proactive tech refresh: develop a "Buy, Hold, Sell" strategy for your architecture and implement a review loop for future refresh cycles. Integration: Look at introducing more automation for your best-integrated technologies, and make sure integration capabilities are part of your purchasing requirements. SecOps: Evaluate your SecOps strengths ­ people, process, and technology ­ and build from there to maximize efficiency and mature detection and response. BCDR: Don't run your disaster recovery capabilities separately from your other security functions; make sure identification is part of BCDR, threat detection, and other security operations so that everyone is working from the same playbook.
41

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned
In the next 6-9 months:
­ Choose metrics for your selected practices and outcomes and create a twice-annual report for at least some of them, so that you get used to evaluating your program and can deliver the results to management whenever needed.
­ Analyze your organization's overall tech architecture strategy against the success factors we listed in the report. Should you evaluate more cloudbased infrastructure? Is more consolidation indicated? Should you switch from performing your own tech integrations to a preferred-vendor strategy?
­ Consider overhauling your BCDR program to introduce more varied and frequent exercises, moving away from the standard playbooks and using more unexpected and unpredictable scenarios. Embrace the chaos!
