Acquire target, sneak in, hop around
1. Penetrate the perimeter with relatively Command & advanced techniques
Control via Botnet Get privileged access to critical assets
2. Expand internal footprint by mimicking privileged users & authorized users
Conduct the crime for an extended time
3. Achieve Persistence
