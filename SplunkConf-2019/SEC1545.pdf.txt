Session Outcomes
I would like you to take the following away from this session:
Evaluate and clarify the primary objective of your SOC program Evaluate and refine your definition of SOC use case Assess how comprehensive and effective your use cases are, and try the detection matrix recommendation Evaluate your continuous use case improvement lifecycle, and sources of inspiration for your use cases

Strategy Requires an Achievable Objective
Security Operations Objective: Minimize the negative impact an adversary can produce on your "For every intrusion event there exists an adovregrsaanriyzatatkioinng. a step towards an intended goal by using a
capability over infrastructure against a victim to produce a result." ­Axiom 1 of the Diamond Model

Effective Strategy
An effective strategy continuously addresses these four elements.

Who are our adversaries, and what are their motives and opportunities?

What infrastructure must our adversaries traverse to get to their targets, and what reliable telemetry can we employ to observe this activity?

Infrastructure
Technology

Adversary

Social-political

What Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures do our adversaries employ, and what use Capability cases can we develop to detect and respond to them?

Victim
How are we susceptible to being a victim, and what activities are normal vs. anomalous within our infrastructure?

Recommendation ­ Build a Detection Matrix To be effective, we must understand where we have use cases to detect adversarial
capabilities (i.e. TTP) over what infrastructure, and where we do not have coverage.
For this, build a detection matrix.

To build matrix:
1. Document all use cases in a spreadsheet. 2. Add two columns to map to Mitre ATT&CK Tactics and to
Techniques. 3. Add two columns to map to Infrastructure (categories as shown
above) and Data Sources. Notes: · A single use case often maps to multiple tactics, techniques, data
sources, and infrastructure categories. · You may also want to add device counts (x of y reporting) to
describe how many devices are actually sending correct data. · Since use cases map to multiple tactics and infrastructure, you
have to total those against the entire dataset.

Advantages of building Detection Matrix:
 To date, the Mitre ATT&CK matrix is the most comprehensive set of TTP to represent the spectrum of adversarial capabilities.
 Understand where you have coverage and where you do not.  Understand the natural bias you/your team has (i.e. if you have an
I&AM background, most of your use cases are likely I&AM related).  The mapping exercise by itself will help you understand your use cases on a deeper level, and you will likely get additional ideas just doing the mapping.  Asking others to get involved in mapping typically sparks debate and also leads to additional ideas on how to increase coverage.  Mapping use cases to data requirements also set the requirements for data health monitoring.

Understand End-to-End Cyber Response
To efficiently respond to cyber threats, Analysts must be able to observe, orient, decide, and act to disrupt kill chains faster than the adversary can rebuild them.

Cyber Security Use Cases Must Account for SOEL To achieve this efficiency, we must expand the definition of security use cases from
detection alerts to the end-to-end Security Operations Event Lifecycle, and evaluate how to make each step in the decision process faster.

Tactical Guidance on Efficient Operations
Orchestration first ­ First start with understanding your detection and response processes and how to orchestrate them, then focus on automation
Prioritize your process engineering ­
· Identify the processes you operate the most, and which response processes are most business critical (e.g. ransomware response)
· Prioritize your process engineering on the above and level of effort to make changes
Modular automation ­ Identify specific sub-processes that are good candidates for automation (i.e. lock use account, gather information on IP address, etc.), and develop reusable modular automation scripts that can be called across your orchestrated processes
Close the loop between operations and engineering ­
· Your engineering team can onboard new data, integrate with system to contextually enrich your response and/or automate response actions, but their efforts need to be prioritized on the needs of your operations team
· Recommendation: Update your post incident reports to include process improvement ideas (i.e. what data sources would have been helpful, what additional data were needed to provide context to make decisions, etc.)
