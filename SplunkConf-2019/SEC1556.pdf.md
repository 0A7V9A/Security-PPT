MITRE ATT&CK
what's that again?
"MITRE ATT&CKTM is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations."
AKA
TONS of Work To Do

PROS:
· Visualize overall defenses against
advanced attackers
· Pinpoint high value investments in security
data sources and content development

CONS:
· Advanced techniques hide in noisy log
sources
· Considerable amount of work to
comprehensively address

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

MITRE ATT&CK
tactics to tack on

Initial Access

Execution

Persistence Privilege Escalation

Defense Evasion

Credential Access

Discovery

Lateral Movement

Collection

Command Exfiltration Impact and Control

 Tactics give us categories of activity
· Techniques offer specifics of activity
 Single techniques from one tactic can be normal activity
 Sudden use of multiple tactics = badness?

Let's make a quick risk rule!

Risk Building + Alerting
the meat and potatoes

Risk Indexing and Alerting
the one two punch
Risk Indexing
collect events to a summary index (doesn't incur license usage!) add useful metadata for tuning or analyst context events don't need to add risk; can be for situational awareness
Risk Alerting
search events in the risk index by user or host slice data to find potentially malicious activity monitor and adjust enrichment to tune add useful metadata for analyst
NOTE: you must add fields to your Risk data model; try to cap at 10-15 and combine information into single fields

now what?

It's not just risk scores, it's ANY cool way to slice it!

Risk Score Exceeds Threshold Multiple MITRE Tactics
High Number of Unique ATT&CK Techniques Sudden Increase in ATT&CK Techniques Sudden Significant Increase in Risk Score Risk Events from Numerous Sourcetypes
