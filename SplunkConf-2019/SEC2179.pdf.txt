Food for Thought
Ask these questions frequently

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Are my log sources deployed widely
enough to cover my environment?
2. Are my log sources configured properly to
detect the threat?
3. Are my log sources even capable of
detecting the threat?

Log Forwarding Recommendations
Remediate logging issues
· Solution dependent on log source and environment
Audit inventory with CMDB
· Compare device counts with Splunk
Automate logging configuration during provisioning
· For Windows, use Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) · For Linux, manage syslog config with automation tools (Puppet, Ansible, etc.)
Filter event types on high volume log sources

Logging Linux Command History

> select time,username,command from users join shell_history using (uid);

> auditctl ­a exit,always execve

Detect with Splunk
Query to view logged Windows event IDs Can run similar searches for other log sources

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Logging Level Recommendations
Ensure correct event types are configured Enable logging for important Windows events
· Enable PowerShell logging (script block or module)
Enable Auditd or osquery

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Lack of Detection Capability
No functionality to detect certain activities

Common Detection Failure Examples
Static IDS/Antivirus signatures General lack of signatures Firewalls without application protocol awareness

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

PowerShell Arguments
· Arguments are case-insensitive
· Arguments are auto-completed as long as the string is unique
© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Regex:
(?i)-(en[encodma]*|ec)\s+[a-z0-9+\/=]{4,}

Lack of Detection Recommendations
Behavioral-based tools Defense in depth Know the weaknesses in your tools' signatures
· Account for variations of PowerShell arguments and other commands
Enable auditd or osquery

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Testing
Proactively discover logging gaps

How to Test

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Assign roles for the tester and validator
2. Identify the activity you would like to
detect
3. Identify the log source dependencies
4. Coordinate with teams to setup
necessary infrastructure
5. Emulate activity
6. Verify logs in SIEM

Testing Challenges
Target host does not mirror production config Don't have admin credentials to target host Attacker host is not located in the network for proper traffic logging Attacker activity not properly emulated Testing objectives are too broad

Testing Tips

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Develop a detailed plan of what to test
2. Target single scenarios ­ don't boil the
ocean
3. Have dedicated testers from offensive
and defensive teams
4. Test the concept, not the content
5. Take it slow and be methodical

Recap

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Are my log sources deployed widely
enough to cover my environment?
2. Are my log sources configured properly
to detect the threat?
3. Are my log sources even capable of
detecting the threat?
