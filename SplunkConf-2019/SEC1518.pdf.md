Wait ... I Have How Many AWS Accounts?

Agenda and Scope:

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. What we are talking about 2. ATO: Authority To Operate 3. SCP: Service Control Policy 4. Who should be in the room
· One or more Cloud workloads · More that 6 months Cloud Admin exp · Splunk Admin Skills

The Landscape

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Many Organizations have dozens or more AWS Accounts
· How many are managed by Service Integrators (SI)?
Many Organizations have Accounts that have ATO from 2 or 3+ years ago
· Have they been updated since then?
Many Organizations have never completed a Well Architected Review
· Over 60+ questions, many focused on AWS specific controls for:
­ Security ­ Operations ­ Fault Tolerance

AWS Organizations
Centralize governance across multiple AWS accounts
ORGANIZATION

AWS Organizations
Central governance and management
Govern Account Access
· Enforce Federated Access (Roles vs Users)
Automate Account Creation
· Centralize, govern and automate to meet your baseline
Enforce CloudTrail and Config Logging
· Enable by default to your specific configuration standards
Service Control Policies
· One of the most amazing things ever!

SCPs: IAM Policies Applied to AWS Organizations, OUs, and Accounts

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

ORGANIZATION

Administrator sets SCP as an organization-level boundary

Give project owners full control over IAM policies

SCP in an AWS Authorization

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

ORGANIZATION

SCPs considered in all AWS authorization decisions for any IAM principal in the org/OU/account

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
SCP Example: Amazon EC2 Instance Types
{ "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "ec2:RunInstances", "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*", "Condition": { "StringNotLike": { "ec2:InstanceType": [ "*.nano", "*.micro", "*.small" ] O}RGANIZATION }
}
{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "ec2:RunInstances", "Resource": "*"
}

SCP Example: Approved AWS Regions

{ "Effect": "Deny", "NotAction": [ "iam:*", "organizations:*", "route53:*", ... ] "Resource": "*", "Condition": { "StringNotEquals": { "aws:RequestedRegion": [ "us-east-1",
ORG"AuNsI-ZwAeTstIO-1N
] } } }

A few AWS services are global; ensure that you exclude them here

{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "*", "Resource": "*"
}

Management Plane vs Data Plane
Management Plane
· What is happening to my AWS Resources
­ Security Group Creation or Modification ­ EC2 Server Reboot or Termination
Data Plane
· What is happening to my Applications or Mission Services
­ Ticket creation in ServiceNow ­ Data entry into my Database

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

AWS Config
Identify resources and detect changes
· Continuous recording and continuous assessment service · Tracks configuration changes to AWS resources · Alerts you if the configuration is non-compliant with your policies · Automated remediation of non-compliant resources

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

AWS Config Rules
Detect and respond to non compliant changes
Checks the validity of configurations recorded
AWS managed rules
· Defined by AWS · Requires minimal (or no) configuration · Rules are maintained by AWS
Customer managed rules
· Authored by you using AWS Lambda · Rules execute in your account · You match the rule

CloudTrail
Detect and investigate activity
· Compliance audits of account activity using automatically recorded and centrally stored event logs · Perform security audits and operational troubleshooting using API usage events · Apply governance automatically in response to API events using custom workflows · Raise alarms in response to Account Activity

Network Layer Logging
VPC flow logs

· Agentless · Enable per elastic network interface, per subnet, or per VPC · Logged to CloudWatch Logs or S3 · Create metrics from logged data · Alarm based on those metrics (ex. Number of Rejected packets on Port 22)

Network Layer Logging
Traffic mirroring, ELB logs and DNS logs
VPC Traffic Mirroring (New!)
· Capture and Inspect · Not yet in GovCloud, only with Nitro-based Instances
AWS Elastic Load Balancing Access Logs
· Requests sent to the ELB
­ Type (http/s, ws, wss), client:port, target:port, response processing time, user agent, ssl protocol...
DNS Logs
· Public Hosted zones only

S3 Object Level Logging
Some property differences

Log Property
Deliver logs to more than one destination (for example, send the same logs to two different buckets) Turn on logs for a subset of objects (prefix)
Object operations (using Amazon S3 APIs)
Bucket operations (using Amazon S3 APIs)
Fields for object lock parameters, Amazon S3 select properties for log records Fields for Object Size, Total Time, Turn-Around Time, and HTTP Referrer for log records Lifecycle transitions, expirations, restores Authentication failures1

AWS CloudTrail Amazon S3 Server Logs YES

1. CloudTrail does not deliver logs for requests that fail authentication (in which the provided credentials are not valid). However, it does include logs for requests in which authorization fails (AccessDenied) and requests that are made by anonymous users.

Is There a SIEM?

Does it SOAR?

Good Intentions are Bad
Mechanisms and good processes are required
Guardrails, Auditability
· If a log fall in your environment, and no one audits it...
Consolidation to Splunk
· Multi- Account, Multi-Organization automated getting data in (GDI)
Near Real-time: If a qualified event is received, does someone re-act.
· Push driven event buses
Less Sensitive Stuffs
· Poller based, or slower batch push events

Getting Cloud Data into Splunk

Problem Statement
How to enable (cloud) Data-to-Everything?
Customers are struggling to configure and collect data from cloud providers. They are unable to gain visibility from their cloud deployments and are being exposed to operational, security and business vulnerabilities.
Traditionally Splunk has not been the easiest product to get data in, especially from third party providers.
The problem is only getting worse since "Cloud First" is creating a scale issue that customers cannot keep up with.

· Different teams setup collection in a different way
