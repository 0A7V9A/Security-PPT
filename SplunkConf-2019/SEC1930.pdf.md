Compliance and risk frameworks may be consistent across organizations

Even when consistent, every organization has different needs based on their maturity

Organizational maturity states may include:
· Crawl: Basic processes, manual evidence, but limited visibility · Walk: Limited real-time insights and reporting visibility ­ some automation · Run: Comprehensive near real-time insights, reporting, and automation

Finally, a quick and completely unscientific poll

Giant Leaps Toward Maturity
Achieving real-time integrated risk visibility

Giant Leaps Toward Maturity
Achieving real-time integrated risk visibility ­ Splunk Compliance Analytics

Splunk Enterprise + Splunk Compliance Analytics provide a quick-start solution

SCA provides a path to rapidly jump up the maturity curve and offers extensibility

· This is a great starting point for technical control monitoring, but it is not the top-tier of the maturity curve
· Your organization may require more out-of-the-box

Key Features:  Provides a quick-start way to rapidly jump up the
maturity curve  Baseline technical controls for near real-time visibility  tstats-based searches for performance  Easily scalable / customizable for org-specific needs

Giant Leaps Toward Maturity
Achieving real-time integrated risk visibility ­ Qmulos Q-Audit

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

 Contextualization of logs is highly valuable
 Q-Audit enables a deep-dive into audit controls
· Provides prescriptive audit policy (ICS 500-27) and analytics to monitor them ­ out of the box

Key Insights:
 A lot of organizations use Splunk to just store audit logs
 Q-Audit takes things to a whole different level  Shows what you should log  How to monitor those logs and alert in real time  Enables actual monitoring of users and device activity
 This ensures that your org is fulfilling the actual purpose of audit controls

 Tough part is mapping the vendor-specific event codes to the audit policy and auditable event categories
