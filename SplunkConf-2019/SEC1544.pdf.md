Event Sequencing and Audit

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Event Sequencing
Group correlation searches into batches of events, either in a specific sequence, by specific attributes, or both The Event Sequencing Engine runs as a indexed real-time search and listens for incoming notable events and risk modifiers that are triggered by correlation searches Stored in the sequence_templates.conf file

Initial Configuration
Requires the edit_sequence_template capability
· ES assigns the capability to the ess_admin role

Closing Thoughts

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Incident Management Framework drives
Notable Events
2. Good Deal of Flexibility to Handle How
You Deal with Different Notables and What The Analyst Sees
3. Ensure your notables are high fidelity
before leveraging event sequencing
4. Suppression provides a trackable method
to handle noisy notables but action is required!
