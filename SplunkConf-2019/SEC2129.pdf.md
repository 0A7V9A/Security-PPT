the presence of dark wizards?
3. Let's journey into the dark forest and hunt
down the death eaters!

Why is the magic of Machine Learning (ML) essential to Defense Against the Dark Arts?

Machine Learning

can help you ...

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
...so you can find your bears!

How Does Machine Learning Work?
Do you believe in magic?

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Use mathematical models to learn patterns in information

Catalog the patterns (and in some cases, iterate them as new data is received)

Use learned patterns to understand and interpret
new data or make predictions

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Machine learning doesn't solve cyber security, but it
can help!

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
How are we seeing organizations detect the presence of dark wizards?

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Who Finds Anomalies Like This Today?
One search with a static threshold
Alert me!

How About Like This?
One search with a dynamic threshold

Alert me!

Alert me!

ML = Stats OR ML != Stats?

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Check Out SSE For a Jump Start with 17 Use-cases
Thanks Splunk Security Essentials (SSE)!

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Is this scalable?
You're running your anomaly search on all your data every time...

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Instead, try...
fit first and then, apply

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
...and make sure your data fits the model...
not the other way around.

Enter Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)
Extends Splunk with new tools and guided modeling environment
Experiments and Assistants: Guided model building, testing, and deployment for common objectives
Showcases: Interactive examples for typical IT, security, business, and IoT use cases
Algorithms: 80+ standard algorithms (supervised & unsupervised)
ML Commands: New SPL commands to fit, test, score and operationalize models
ML-SPL API: Extensibility to easily import any algorithm (proprietary / open source)
Python for Scientific Computing Library: Access to 300+ open source algorithms
Apache Spark MLLib: Support large scale model training via Spark Add-on for MLTK (LAR)
Tensorflow Container: Supports NN and GPU accelerated

Let's journey into the dark forest and hunt down the death eaters!

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Who In My Network is Executing Unusual DNS Query Lengths?
Which looks more unusually long to you?
ec2-13-193-103-139.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com OR
p4-csddrc45xqiym-xmvtplcdqchjqs5r-322917-i2.anycast-stb.metric.gstatic.com

Why Should You Care?
A look at our sample dataset

A lot of DNS query length anomalies

Static threshold

273 anomalies

Standard Deviation

38 anomalies

With new ES searches using fit & apply

Creating a Model For Our Dataset
First the fit...

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Notice we're building a model called "dns_query_pdfmodel"

Notice Your Model is Saved In MLTK!
Bigger, stronger models to scale

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Applying the Model to Our Dataset
...then the apply!

Notice our 38 anomalies

Operationalize It!

Normal Distribution
How likely is the data found within a population?
99.7% of data 95% of data 68% of data
Values found over here are probably outliers

Values found over here are probably outliers

-3 stdev -2 stdev -1 stdev Average +1 stdev +2 stdev +3 stdev
The percentages designate the area under the curve

Look What Happens When We Assume Our Data is Normally Distributed...

Your Data May Not Always be So "Normal"

3 SD above

When viewing our data as a histogram, the average may not be so "average"

What If We Could Follow the Shape of Our Data?
We can with the DensityFunction algorithm!

Which is Why ESCU is Upgrading Some Numeric Outlier Detection Use-cases!
The DNS Query Length with High Standard Deviation search turned into
the fit ESCU - Baseline of DNS Query Length -MLTK search +
the apply DNS Query Length Outliers - MLTK search

Key Takeaways
Hogwarts has served you well!

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. ML can positively impact your security
practice!
2. You too can do data science; be a citizen
data scientist.
3. Split one search into two with fit and
apply concepts to make ML scale.
4. Download ESCU, MLTK and SSE for
free!
