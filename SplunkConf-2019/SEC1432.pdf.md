Using Find and Replace
 Choose Edit, Find, Replace or use the key command Ctrl + H
 Type text that should be changed in the Find what field
 Type the new text in the Replace with field  Click the Replace button to make the
replacements one at a time or click Replace All to replace everything at once
Note: Use caution when replacing content with the Replace All command. It will change content in your entire presentation (dates, numbers, words, etc.), not just the slide or master you happen to be on in that moment.

Checking for Quality
 Use spell check (Review/Spelling) to ensure that all words are spelled correctly
 Read your slides out of order (ex., start at the back) which causes reading to be more focused
 Check the flow of the presentation in the Slide Sorter view  Run through the presentation in Slide Show view  Check animations, alignments, and transition consistency  Check that images are placed properly and that text is legible  If possible run the presentation through the medium that you
will be using (online, overhead, print, etc.)

Tips for Reducing File Size

 Eliminate unnecessary graphics and slides
 Compress images and delete cropped areas of images
· Use document resolution for optimum quality
· Compress one image at a time, not the entire
presentation, so that if compression is too low on any one image, you can adjust the level of compression on that image

 Create basic shapes in PowerPoint instead of importing images of shapes
 Import images at the exact size they will be displayed
 Build charts from the template, or paste charts in as single Excel worksheets (i.e., no extra data / worksheets in the document)
 Delete rogue masters and layouts
 Use Save As to delete information retained in the file from fast saves
