Insider Threat Detection with MLTK

"An insider threat is an individual who uses authorized access to an organization's assets to use their access, either maliciously or unintentionally, in a way that could negatively affect the organization."
Carnegie Mellon CERT Insider Threat Center

Types of Insider Threat

Data Theft

Sabotage

Fraud

Workplace Violence

What can we do about it?

Example Insider Threat Heuristics
What can we monitor to identify threats?

Local Logs
· In many Insider Threat cases, the activity begins with a user logging in at an abnormal time.
Network Logs
· Traffic Flow through your web proxy, for example can tell us a lot about potential Data Exfiltration.

&
Much More

But First....
Some things to consider about execution
Designing Use Cases
· Introducing use cases can be complicated · Primary Behavior + Enriching Details · Adaptable solutions

Notifying the SOC Analysts
· Dashboards with Drill-downs · Alerts via email · Notable Events

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Use cases should be well-tested, adaptable, and policies should be understood by all stakeholders.

Measurements of behavior are established over a 30-day period which makes for some interesting alerting.

Using Your Data to Measure Insider Threat Behaviors
Some SPL code to identify a few important examples of user behavior heuristics

Example Use Case: Variance in Web Uploads
Based on true events

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Scenario: An employee of a bank became concerned after a recent wave of layoffs. The user began searching for a new job. Before resigning, they capture a large amount of data from the bank's CRM and copy it into Word documents before emailing them during non-working hours and sending them out through a personal Gmail account.
· So in this case, is 20MB of Data outbound through the Web Proxy a threat to the organization? Yes, of course.
· How could you identify events like this in your environment?
· Signature-based policies won't work very well here. Try implementing an alert every time someone uploads more than 20MB of data in your network over the course of an extended period of time (But don't, actually, unless you hate your analysts).

Variance in Login Time
Our user logged in on a Saturday evening
How would we identify this type of behavior?
· Day of the week · Time of Day · By User
How would we measure variation from the baseline?
· Earliest and Latest Logins · Statistical Measurements · Account for employees on any shift

Login Activity Baselines Search
Let's explain what's going on in that search

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

1. Get your time value to the number of seconds in a day, then make it into a circle because the difference between 11:59PM and 12:01 AM is 2 minutes, not 23 hours and 58 minutes.
2. Calculate the average modified time values by each day, including week day.
3. Obtain an arctangent value and take baseline descriptive statistics by user and day.
4. Output baselines for future use.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Login Activity Variance Search
Let's explain what's going on in that search
1. Calculate the earliest and latest login times for each user and day while retaining day of week values.
2. Calculate the modified time values with arctangent. 3. Take data from baselines and append to the DataFrame. 4. Fill Null values and replace 0 stdev values (No dividing by zero!). 5. Calculate measurements for New Days where there is no baseline. 6. Evaluate the maximum risk score by user. 7. Output the behavior for later use.

Employee Flight Risk
Most Insider Threat incidents occur within 90 days of employee departure from the job
How would we identify this type of behavior?
· Visits to Job Search Websites · Uploads to Job Search Websites · Email correspondence with competitors
What kind of issues can be expected?
· HR/Recruiters managing job postings · Hiring Managers actively recruiting new employees

Flight Risk Variation Search
Let's explain what's going on in that search
1. Calculate the count of Job Search site visits by day for users. 2e.. (e for extra credit) This is an example of how to look for uploads such as a
resume upload or uploading content to profiles on job sites. Just a demonstration, not actively used here. 32.. Calculate the average and standard deviation of the sample. 43.. Append the prior dataset to users, fill null values with 0, then calculate risk score for users. 54.. Output the behavior to a lookup for later use.

Web Upload Behavior
How do we determine if a web upload is out of the norm?
How would we identify this type of behavior?
· Large one-shot uploads to a site · Smaller, incremental uploads to a site · Either of the above to a new/uncommon website
What kind of issues can be expected?
· Uploading content to internal sites such as Sharepoint (Whitelist) · Depending on measurement, some features such as autosave on Word live
documents could be common false positives.

Web Upload Baselines Search
Let's explain what's going on in that search
1. Use stats to measure the total output for users and websites by day. Calculate descriptive statistics.
2. Calculate the average of the average output for user to fill nulls later. Then output results to a lookup for later use.

1. Use stats to measure the total output for users and websites by day. Calculate descriptive statistics including count.
2. Use lookup from previous step to add values, take the average of the sample standard deviation to fill null values.
3. Fill nulls, then calculate the Web Upload Risk Score

Learning From the Data
Let's use MLTK!

Many Dimensions of Behavior

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Multiple Measurements of User Behavior
· User Login Variance · User Flight Risk Score · User Variance in Web Uploads
Identifying Outliers
· Primary measurement: Web Upload Variance · Secondary, Enriching Values: Flight Risk Score, Login Variance
"To deal with a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3-D space and say `fourteen' to yourself very loudly. Everyone does it." ­ Geoffrey Hinton

DBSCAN Algorithm
This awesome algorithm ships with Splunk MLTK
Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
· MLTK uses scikit-learn library for DBSCAN · What is DBSCAN composed of?
­ Core Points ­ Border Points ­ Noise Points
· Parameters/Tuning
­ Minimum Family Size of 5 (auto: min_samples=5) ­ Epsilon
DBSCAN is great at separating clusters of high-density and at identifying noise from those clusters.

Unsupervised Learning
Now that we've done the fun part of aggregating data, let's get some results!
Identifying Irregular Outbound Data
· Start with search for primary activity · Append user activity with behavior risk scores · Identify outliers with algorithm · Filter out noise

Integrating with ES
We've got good results, now let's tell the SOC

Connecting with the SOC
Solutions for Splunk ES as well as Core Splunk
Now that the results have been generated, how do we get it in front of the SOC Analysts?
· Notable Events/Splunk Alerts to view a Dashboard · Notable Events/Splunk Alerts with content from lookups
What content should we display?
· Drill-Downs from Dashboards for SOC Analysts to dig deeper · Enriching Details on Dashboards/Lookups
­ | eval Comment1 = if(Risk_Score > 7,"User is a big risk, watch out!", "This user is chill, bro.") ­ | eval Comment2 = if(total_bytes_out>1024*1024,"User uploaded ".total_bytes_out." to ".website, "") ­ | eval User_Behavior = Comment1 + " " + Comment2

Dashboard
What are the benefits
Alert a SOC Analyst with "Check this Dashboard"
· Set to run on a schedule · Send an alert/notable event
Dashboard can provide additional detail
· Comments on User Behavior from a variety of sources (Login Time/Flight Risk Score) · Drill-Downs with tokens can show additional detail
­ What day the user logged in at an odd time ­ What websites and times a user used Job Search sites ­ Timestamps, bytes_out, and full url's for web uploads to the site in question

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Lookups
A more advanced method
Alert a SOC Analyst with New Results
· Output a lookup with positive results on a schedule
­ When outputting results, include a time value (| eval time = now()) ­ Use inputlookup to pull in results
Sort by time Use streamstats count and last(bytes_out) Use eventstats to identify most recent wave of results
By identifying the most recent events, and the variance between prior events and the current one ­ filtering can be done to alert the SOC only when there is a New Event or when a user who previously was alerted on has now sent much more outbound data.
