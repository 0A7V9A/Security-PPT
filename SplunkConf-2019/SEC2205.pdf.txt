Collective Challenges
SOC analyst to faculty/staff/student ratio is high (1:24,000)
Good people are hard to find and retain
· Central PA isn't exactly Silicon Valley · 5 open positions!
Not staffed 24/7
Mundane, repetitive (but also time consuming) tasks
Load balancing challenges between analysts
· Duplication of efforts · Inconsistencies in execution

Solution
Automation with Phantom
· Or as we lovingly call Phantom, "Ava"
Addresses all of our challenges:
· Hiring/retention: always here (provided we pay the bill!) · Runs 24/7 · Excels at repetitive tasks · Always does exactly what we tell it to do · Automatically identifies duplicates

Motivations for Tier 1 Playbook

150 Phishing reports per day

5 Security Staff Members

Analysts had to manually retrieve data for each phish (importance of the submitter, analyze headers, extract IOCs, etc.) which consumed two FTEs.
Responses to the reports were generic; custom responses are more effective
