SOC Automation ­ Acceptable Use Cases
Overview

· Understand the alerts your SOC receives
· Prioritize by dwell time and mitigation importance
· Do analysts follow a standard analytical process?
· Do alerts have high true positive rate?
· Prioritize most repetitive and least amount of logical reasoning
· What are the common type(s) of threats are your analysts investigating?
· Can you easily remove noise/volume with correct tagging/classifications?

Overview & Objectives

By the Numbers...

· Objective: Build a model that is capable of recognizing whether a reported email is benign, phishing or spam.
· Email body is extracted from each data example and text is preprocessed and tokenized to be used as the main contributing features to build the model.
· Dataset is randomly split into 80/20 proportion with 80% (~5600) used as training and 20% (~1400) used as test/evaluation set.
· Model is trained using Naïve Bayes algorithm, with an training accuracy score of 81%.
· ML is just one action out of many others that are used in making the final verdict. Final verdicts are always calculated based on the responses from every action.

· Data is parsed and validated · Data is sent to processing actions per IOC type · Kill switches allow for certain actions to be
enabled/disabled
· Each action has "Plug-n-Play" approach, flexible
· Actions are for gathering data from internal/external tools, not decision making
· Responses from actions are all logged into Splunk following a specific logging pattern
· Logs error handling · Maps to custom Splunk data model

Splunk App & Data Model

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

· Phantom is the orchestration portion and Splunk is the decision engine.
· All knowledge objects related to the framework are stored in its own app on Splunk Enterprise (ex. data models, alerts, dashboards, etc.).
· Each Phantom action is organized into a custom Splunk Data Model that is used to standardize logging patterns, probabilities, verdicts and mitigations.
· The container ID is the unique identifier for each email and tracks all processing, verdict, and mitigations activities.
· Each action has a calculated score that determines the probability of the results contributing to the email being spam, phishing, or benign.
· A custom verdict algorithm is used to make a final decision based on every action that returned results.
· Once the verdict is determined, alerts will trigger pre-determined mitigation playbooks and/or trigger a notable event to be triaged in Enterprise Security.
· All mitigation and processing activities for phishing events are logged and tracked in an internal case management system.
