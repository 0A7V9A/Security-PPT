Data Management
in Custom Code
Playbooks

 Sometimes no substitute for custom code  Global scope usage is discouraged, so how should
data be persisted across action calls?
 save_data()  simple, permanent, key-based string storage
 save_run_data()  temporary playbook execution data
 save_object()  context-linked by either event or playbook  can be auto-deleted when event is closed  wildcard _ and % patterns
 action and playbook handle  maintain state across a single action or sub-playbook call
