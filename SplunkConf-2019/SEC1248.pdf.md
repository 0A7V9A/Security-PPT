Sooooo.....
Everyone knows what UBA is, right?
 Yes, I know I used this meme last year
 UBA is an amazing piece of technology
 It's exceptional at finding all the things that you forgot to look for
 It can find the things you want to look for
 It is not great at finding Bob logging into your server for the first time (actually, it really is good at that, but you did pay money for this tool, don't you want it to do what it's supposed to do?)

 The exe passkey triggered in UBA  Threat associated with it due to
suspicious location of process (c:\windows\system32\printdrv)
· agrady-l is the associated workstation · frothly_helpdesk is the associated user
 Looking further into agrady-l, we see previous IOCs of tar.exe and hostname.exe
 tar.exe has been used to extract printdrv.tar and create kennwort.tar.gz and leckereien.tar.gz
 A Google search of kennwort shows it's German for "password"  A Google search for leckereien shows it translates to "goodies"

 sd.exe was executed (unknown executable)
 rdputil.exe was executed (unknown executable ­ MS is mstsc.exe)
 That suspicious directory is C:\Windows\system32\printdrv
Because "C:\Windows\System32\printdrv" is totally a place I would execute files from!!!!

 sd.exe was executed (unknown executable)
 rdputil.exe was executed (unknown executable ­ MS is mstsc.exe)
 That suspicious directory is C:\Windows\system32\printdrv
 NEW
 svc_print user is involved in a bunch of threats/anomalies
 svc_print apparently executed encrypted powershell commands
 Those encrypted PS commands were malicious and involved scheduled tasks

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Where do we go from here?
 svc_print account should be disabled  sd.exe should be removed  rdputil.exe should be removed  msfont.ps1 which was a scheduled task? Yah, that was meterpreter  printdrv.ps1 is the beaconing software out to imperialstout.org

Best/Worst Practices

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Quick Synopsis
 Each Section Here · First Slide: Bad things we've seen in the field · Subsequent Slides: How to combat those things
1. Pre-everything! 2. Architecture 3. Usage

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Pre-Installation
These are things NOT to do...

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

 Size UBA for 1000 accounts when there's 15,000 accounts
 Assure us all data is CIM compliant and on-boarded into Splunk
 IOPS of 800? No problem!
 Limit data or decrease logging
 Block basic networking ports (80/443)

 Need UBA because it's UBA!

Best Practices
Meet all the pre-requisites
 Indexed Real Time Required  DHCP, Windows Security Logs,
Proxy, and Firewall required
 DNS is preferred  Asset information  IOPS at 1200+  Network ports open  Use cases well defined  For more information:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentati on/UBA/latest/Install/Requirements

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Architecture
What not to do!
 When sized at 10 servers, create 12
 Install on shared infrastructure (VM)  Try to install on AIX, Windows,
SELinux Kernel, or one of the other 20 different distributions that aren't supported
 Just add some extra servers for HA/DR
 Position your UBA cluster in a data center across the country from your Splunk installation

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Architecture

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

 Size appropriately! More on next slide
 Used dedicated resources (CPU and Memory)
 Install on approved and supported OSes
 Follow docs for HA/DR: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentati on/UBA/latest/Admin/WarmStandby
 Try to place your UBA install as close to Splunk as Possible! Network latency is a thing!

Best Practices
Sizing and Configuration

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

 Sizing exercise with you Splunk SME to verify data load
 16 Core/64 RAM is set ­ throwing 96 cores at it will not affect data processing
 50 GB/1 TB/1 TB drives are required ­ SSD preferred
 AMI and OVA are available

Usage
 Try to replace ES and SSE with UBA  Creating a bunch of basic rule
searches inside of UBA  Trying to integrate everything in UBA
that you already have integrated in Splunk  Treat UBA as a stand-alone platform in your environment

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Usage

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

ES Notable
Event

Phantom

UBA UML

ES

 Pull in correlation notable events from ES
 Send anomalies back to ES and the ES risk framework ­ see RBA deck for more!
 Send threats back to ES as notable events
 Reactions and responses to UBA data should be done through Splunk
 Take the online training!
 Use in conjunction with SSE, ES, and Phantom!

Where to go from here?
