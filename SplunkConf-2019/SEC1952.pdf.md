Basics of Hunting Be Efficient
· Use Macros
­ /en-US/manager/search/admin/macros
Analyze quickly
· Stats are your friend
­ | stats values(<field>)by <field>
· Cast that net wide!
­ | stats values(dest) by dest_port
Be specific
· Zone in on critical processes or eventIDs

Key Takeaways

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
1. Hunting can be hard or easy ­ It's what
you make it
2. Know your data ­ If you want to hunt
endpoints, you'll need the right sources
3. Test yourself ­ Know what you can detect
before you miss it
