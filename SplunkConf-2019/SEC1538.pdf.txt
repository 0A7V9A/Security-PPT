The Unanswered Questions

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

"So what's going on?"
­ Every Manager Ever

"Were there any "Where did it

other alerts?"

come from?"

­ The Concerned Manager

­ The Curious Manager

Problem/Solution
Problem:
Alerts that provide little context and are not efficiently utilizing analyst's time.

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Solution: Build a risk-based alerting system that increases accuracy of alerts and provides a readily available "alert narrative."

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
"The Risk Analysis framework provides the ability to identify actions that raise the risk profile of
individuals or assets."

Total Risk Score= 120

*Note: None of these searches had enough accuracy to be included in old model.

Recap

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

One-to-One Model
Small inventory of high accuracy searches
Does not give context to related activity
Analysts investigate each alert
Does not scale smoothly
· More searches typically means more tickets and analyst hours.

Risk-based Model
Large inventory of both high and low accuracy searches
Does give context to related activity
Analysts perform investigations on high risk entities
Scales smoothly
· More searches doesn't mean more investigations. Conditions still must be met.

Things we had in place prior to starting the move to risk-based alerting... or wish we had.
Splunk Enterprise Security
Identity Management
· Systems (assets) · Users (identities)
Search Inventory Lookup
· Contain all correlation searches · Need to be easily scalable

Alert Matrix
Getting Started

Risk

Critical Moderate Low

>50% High High Low

Fidelity
10%-50% Low Low Informational

<10% Informational Informational Informational

Fidelity is a historical measurement of the alert's capability to successfully detect malicious activity
Potential Risk is a categorical measurement based on a confluence of data sensitivity, business impact, and likelihood.

Risk Score Adjustment Search Review Threat Intelligence Test Detections

ONGOING MAINT.
Set values that make sense

Risk Score Adjustment
1. Calculation of fidelity
· Changes lowered or raised percent
2. Criticality of entity
· Do you need additional levels
3. Search weight
· Is this causing too much noise · Is it not raising risk score fast enough

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

ONGOING MAINT.
Is this still doing what I think it's doing?

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Search Review
1. Validate logic
· Log format changes · Additional / Removed systems
2. Identify additional or deprecated
search terms
3. Research additional detections
· Is this search still needed?

ONGOING MAINT.
Primary Source for New Search Development

Threat Intelligence
1. Efficient, Repeatable Process
2. Dedicated, Ongoing Investment
· Sporadic research is not enough · More searches = better!
3. Re-evaluate Past Actors
· We mature and so do they

Key Takeaways
Why do I care again?

1. Risk-based alerting will save you time
and improve detection accuracy
2. Use MITRE to build an "alert narrative" to
understand the context around an event
3. Investing more time in building a
comprehensive risk framework will garner better results
