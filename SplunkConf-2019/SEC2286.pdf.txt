Kubernetes
A Pre-attack introduction

Where Did Kubernetes Come From?
Solving Google's scalability problem
Google stages a tremendous number of workloads to millions of physical servers
· 2.5 million servers (2014/2016) · 3 billion containers per week (2014) · Workloads crash, hard drives fail, power supplies fail
The "microservice" development model allows teams to build more complex software without falling victim to problems outlined in "The Mythical Man Month"
· Microservices means all the components of an application need to find all the others

How Does Kubernetes Solve This?
An open source software-defined data center
Explain Kubernetes Features by Describing What You Interact With
Containers started from images Pods as the smallest unit of work Services as the method for reaching pods
· Labeled objects instead of static-named objects
Volumes as the smallest unit of storage Namespaces to organize it Service accounts to authorize it

What Central Components Can We Attack?
How does the system work?
Kubernetes API Server
· Ask it to create a resource and make sure there are always 5 copies of it
ETCD State Server
· API server stores this new state in the etcd server
Controller Manager
· Run infinite control loops to make sure the state always matches the etcd server's description
Scheduler
· Bin-pack containers onto nodes
Kube-DNS
· Give every requested network endpoint (service and pod) a name

What Node Components Can We Attack?
What does a Kubernetes Node run?
Kube-Proxy
· Forwards network traffic to each member of a load-balanced network service
Container Runtime (e.g. Docker)
· Instruct the Linux kernel to create containers
Host Operating System
· Filesystem · Network · Kernel
Workloads
· Containers on the system

How Do We Attack It?
Attacking Kubernetes

Attack Types Possible in Kubernetes
Cluster-native attacks
Ask the API Server to:
· stage containers · change pod definitions · allow us to MitM network traffic · run commands in containers we don't own
Ask the Kubelet to:
· run commands in containers we don't own · display details of all workloads running in the cluster

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Attack Types Possible in Kubernetes
Cloud-only attacks
Interact with the Cloud Provider
· Obtain the node's credentials from the Metadata API · Gain Kubernetes authentication tokens from cloud storage buckets · Modify or create compute instances · Modify or duplicate storage · Interact with any API that the node's credentials allow!

Attack Demonstration
Attacking the Bust-a-Kube intentionally-vulnerable Kubernetes cluster

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Demo

Review that Attack Path
How did we do that?
Gain access inside a Kubernetes cluster
· Exploited a remote code execution vulnerability in Matthew Patel's DHC web application
Attempt API server actions
· Attempt to deploy a host volume-mounting pod, but fail
Move laterally to another host
· Compromise the LLSD Deployment backend service to gain RCE in another pod
Gain another service account
· Exec into another pod via the API server
Start a host-mounting pod
· Ask the API server to start a host-mounting pod

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.

Review that Attack Path
How did we do that?
Start host-mounting pods on all nodes
· Ask the API server to start a daemonset full of host-mounting pods
Make filesystem writes
· Modify the /etc/shadow and /etc/sudoers files on every node

Demonstrating Peirates
Attacking the Kubernetes Cluster with the Open Source Peirates Tool

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
Demo

Review the Second Attack Path
How did we do that?
Gain access inside a Kubernetes cluster
· Exploited a remote code execution vulnerability in an Internet-accessible Redis server
Attempt API server actions
· Attempt to read all secrets in the cluster, but fail on most
Gain the cloud API account for a single node
· Contact the AWS Metadata API and request temporary credentials
Search the cloud storage provider for secrets and access tokens
· Discover the bootstrap certificates for the cluster in an S3 bucket
Pull an Administrative Certificate for the Cluster and Exec Into a Master Pod
· Pull the certificate from the S3 bucket, then exec into a host filesystem-mounting monitoring pod

Purple Team Methodology
Combining Attack and Defense to enable the defenders

© 2019 SPLUNK INC.
"Every contact leaves a trace."
Locard's Exchange Principle

Purple Team Methodology
Coordinated Attack, Detection & Response
Red and Blue Teams Perform "Coordinated Attack, Detection & Response" Pre-planned attack path and execution Working together in real time, perform the steps of the attack:
· Gain access inside a Kubernetes cluster · Attempt API server actions · Move laterally to another host · Gain another service account · Start a host-mounting pod
Blue team increases understanding of offensive technique Red team increases awareness of attack artifacts Document detection gaps, iterate, improve

Splunk ES Detection
Detecting the Attacks with Splunk Enterprise Security

Splunk Enterprise Security
Analytic Stories: Adversary Tactics
Define use case: What problem are we trying to solve?
Identify log sources required for visibility for each step of the attack:
· Gain access inside a Kubernetes cluster · Attempt API server actions · Move laterally to another host · Gain another service account · Start a host-mounting pod
Identify relevant correlation searches
Surface results in notable events
