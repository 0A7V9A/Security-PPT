Traditional network threat model

Server

 Server and user device are trusted  Software is trusted  Untrusted network:
 "man in the middle"

Client User device

 E.g. web server and web browser  Crypto (TLS and web PKI) to protect
communication
3

Communication inside a computer - IPC

 Not all communication goes over the traditional network
 Inter Process Communication
 Multiple untrusted services run inside the user device

Backend process
User device

Frontend process

We try to understand security of communication inside the computer
4

Man in the Machine (MitMa)

Backend process
Alice's session

Frontend process

Guest's session

Malware

 MitMa attacker: Another user at home or at work, including guest

 Attacker goal: Impersonate communication endpoints in IPC

 Attack method:

 Runs a malicious process in the background (no privilege escalation required)

 Fast user switching, remote access (e.g. ssh, remote desktop) 5

IPC methods
 File system  Signal and semaphore  Network socket and Unix domain socket  Message queue  Anonymous pipe and named pipe  Shared memory  Clipboard  Remote Procedure Call (RPC)  USB (though not strictly an IPC method)  ...
9

Network sockets
 Mainly for communication across network but used for IPC as well
 Over loopback interface: 127.0.0.0/8 or ::1/128
 Server listens on a specified port and waits for incoming client requests
 Only a single process can bind to a port at a time  Any process regardless of its owner can listen on ports > 1024
 Local processes can connect to the server as clients if the port is known  No built-in access control
10

Network sockets - Attack vectors (1)

Client impersonation

Server impersonation

 Any local process can connect to any server port on localhost
 If server accepts only one client, connects before the legitimate client

 Bind to the port before the legitimate server does

Network sockets - Attack vectors (1)

Client impersonation

Server impersonation

 Any local process can connect to any server port on localhost
 If server accepts only one client, connects before the legitimate client

 Bind to the port before the legitimate server does

Legitimate and malicious servers cannot bind to the same port at the same time
Man-in-the-Middle?
12

Network sockets - Attack vectors (2)
Man-in-the-Middle attack
 Port agility
 If primary port is taken, the server might failover to another port from a predefined list  MitMa attacker can
 Listen on the primary port to receive client connection, and  Connect himself to the legitimate server on the secondary port

 Port agility
 If primary port is taken, the server might failover to another port from a predefined list  MitMa attacker can
 Listen on the primary port to receive client connection, and  Connect himself to the legitimate server on the secondary port
 No port agility
 Replay messages by alternating between the client and server roles  Rate of messages passing through the attacker will be slow but might still be practical
14

Windows named pipe
 Similar client-server architecture as network socket's, but multiple processes can simultaneously act as servers
 A named pipe can have multiple instances that share the same name  Each instance connects exactly one pipe server and one pipe client  New pipe clients connected to the pipe servers in round-robin order
 Named pipes placed in a special path \\.\pipe\
 Every user (including guest) has access to the path
 Have built-in access control!
15

Windows named pipe - Access control
 If a named pipe doesn't exist, any user can create it (including guest)  If it exists, only users with FILE_CREATE_PIPE_INSTANCE permission
can create new instances  The first instance of the named pipe decides the maximum instances and
security descriptor (DACL)
 Default DACL:  READ access to everyone  FULL access to the creator and admins
16

Windows named pipe - Attack vectors

Client impersonation

Server impersonation

 Any process can connect to any open pipe instance but subject to access control check

 Pipe name hijacking: create the first
instance to control the pipe's DACL and maximum instances
 Set DACL to allow everyone to create new instances

Client + Server impersonation = Man-in-the-middle

17

USB Human Interface Devices (USB HID)
 E.g. keyboards, pointing devices, hardware security tokens  On Linux and macOS,
 USB HIDs accessed from only current active user session
 On Windows,
 USB HIDs accessed from any user session, including those in the background  Security of the devices depends on application-level security mechanism implemented in
the hardware or software

Case study - Dashlane
 Dashlane app runs a WebSocket server on port 11456  Communication:
 Messages encrypted with a key derived from hard-coded constant  Server verifies client by checking:
 Browser extension ID in Origin header of each message  Code signature of the client process to make sure it is a known browser  Client process owned by same user as the server's  Client does NOT verify server

23

Server impersonation on Dashlane (1)
Attack steps:
1. Extract hard-coded encryption key from the browser extension's code 2. Run WebSocket server on port 11456 before the benign server does
 Benign server silently failovers to another port
3. Use the hard-coded key to communicate with the browser extension

Server impersonation on Dashlane (2)
Results:
 Dashlane browser extension collects and sends DOM elements from web pages to app for analysis
 Attacker obtains personal data, such as emails and messages, from web pages
 Server can instruct the browser extension to collect web-form data and send to it
 Attacker obtains any text typed by the user, including credentials
25

Case study - 1Password

 1Password app runs a WebSocket server on port 6263
 Communication:

1. C  S: "hello" 2. C  S: code (random 6-digit string)
3. C  S: hmac_key 4. Both extension and app displays the code

 Server verifies client in the same way as Dashlane does

5. User confirms to the app if they match 6. C  S: "authRegistered"

 In the first communication, server and 7. C  S: nonceC

client run a self-made protocol to agree on a shared encryption key

8. C  S: nonceS, mS=HMAC(hmac_key, nonceS||nonceC)
9. C  S: mC=HMAC(hmac_key, mS)

10. C  S: "welcome"

11. Both sides derive encryption key K=HMAC(hmac_key, ms||mC||"encryption")

Native messaging
 Browser's built-in method for communicating between browser extension and native code
 App registers with the browser:
 an executable, called Native Messaging Host (NMH), and  a configuration file specifying which browser extensions have access to the NMH
 Browser starts the NMH in a child process and lets the browser extension communicate with it

Password managers w/ Native messaging
 Password manager app registers a NMH with the browser and allows only its browser extension to communicate with the NMH
 However, NMH and the native app are still two separate processes  they use IPC to communicate with each other

Case study - Password Boss
 On Windows, named pipe used for IPC between NMH and the native app  When the app starts, it creates a named pipe with:
 Fixed name  Maximum instance = 50  DACL allowing all authenticated users to have FULL access
 NMH connects to the named pipe as a pipe client and forwards messages between browser extension and native app
 All messages are sent in plaintext

Man-in-the-Middle on Password Boss (1)

By authenticated user:
1. Connects as a client to the app's named pipe instance
2. Creates another instance of the named pipe and waits for the NMH
3. NMH connects to the attacker's instance because it is the only open instance
4. Forwards messages between the two pipe instances

Case study - FIDO U2F security key

 2nd authentication factor based on public key crypto and a USB device

Security key

Browser

Server

 Challenge-response protocol

username, password

 Browser keeps sending the challenge from

the server to the device until it receives

response (every 300 ms on Chrome)

challenge

 User activates the device by touching a button on it

User touches button

 The device responds to only the first request

response

after the touch

Verify password challenge

Verify response

36

Unauthorized access of FIDO U2F key
Reminder: On Windows, USB HIDs can be accessed from any user session
Assumption: Attacker has obtained the 1st authentication factor
Attack steps: 1. Signs in to the service in the background using the 1st factor 2. Sends the challenge from the service to the device at a high rate 3. Victim (in the foreground) signs in to ANY service using the same security key and touches the button on the device
 The first button touch had no effect, but such minor glitches are typically ignored
4. The attacker's request gets signed instead of the victim's with high probability, and then the attacker obtains the 2nd factor

Mitigation
 Spatial and temporal separation of users
 Limit the number of users that can access a computer  Disable remote access, such as SSH and Remote desktop
 Attack detection easier in IPC than in network
 Compare owner of client and server processes  Query client/server binary
 Cryptographic protection
 User-assisted pairing vs TLS and PKI  Avoid self-made crypto!
40

Conclusion
Software developers beware, IPC is not inherently secure!
 Unprivileged user or process can attack IPC of another user on the same computer
 Traditional network security threats exist also in IPC  We are doing a more exhaustive survey
 Contribute, if you are interested!
