Predatory Publishing

"Predatory conferences or predatory meetings are meetings set up to appear like legitimate scientific conferences but which are exploitative as they do not provide proper editorial control over presentations and advertising can include claims of involvement of prominent academics who are, in fact, uninvolved." Source: Wikipedia

"Predatory publishers hurt scientists, science, and the communication of science. They trick scientists, pretending to operate as legitimate publishers, when they are essentially counterfeit and only seeking to earn a quick profit." Jeffrey Beal

Miracle Cancer cures Bees are awesome.
Can they heal cancer? Probably not. But who knows?

,,This is a non-scientific approach, just to make money."

Miracle Cancer cures that aren't
Reviewer comments:
"The study provided important experimental and pre-clinical evidences demonstrating the potential application of Bio99TM propolis in cancer treatment."
"Authors may want to clarify what "SiTF" means in Fig. 1"
"Hopefully your research study had Ethics Board review and approval? Better state so. You were intervening w/ human subjects."

,,Propolis is a natural compound produced by bee species such as the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal and antipyretic properties. In this way it has been popular as a health promoter since antiquity. Furthermore, there are no known instances of adenocarcinoma in Apidae..." But the general nature of Apidae and their ethologic patterns (as described by Gibbs 2012) further suggest a positive outcome of a propolis based therapy and the development of such propolis-based drugs.

"These studies are wanky. (...) I don't think it's transparent at all for a layman."

- They look at isolated cases. - They use inappropriate testing methods - They are packed with positive assessments - They are so flawed that they should never have
been published in a scientific journal at all

"They exist so that internet pages where these products are sold can link to these scientific articles."

- The files allege that he illegally sold GcMAF as a cancer drug. Based on false studies.
- Our request for comment went ignored.

Defense for Cyber Attacks Against Gibson
Mainframe Computers
Dade Murphy, Kate Libby
Abstract--Gibson based mainframe computer platforms remain vulnerable to a specific class of buffer overflow first identified in 1988. Specifically, it is possible to corrupt the magnetic core memory stack by writing past the end of
protected colonel memory. Code that does this is said to have "Hacked the Gibson", causing a return from the routine to jump to a random address. This gives an attacker access to the superuser account, from where they have access to the
whole system. As of writing, the only defense is to situate Gibson based mainframe computer behind seven or more proxies. Combining next generation, dynamic malware analysis techniques with polymorphic machine learning ZeroR classifiers, we demonstrate a 97.435% accuracy in detecting such attacks. Specifically, we designed four layered ZeroR classifiers which self-modify based on four distinct features present in malicious packets. Features consist of whether
the packet has the FIN, URG and PSH flags set and how fragmented the packet is overall. We extensively evaluated our algorithm on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 81,337 malicious packets and 48,183 legitimate packets. Our
results offer a promising advance in addressing a vulnerability which has existed for nearly three decades.

What we found ­ Big Pharma
,,If you something, pregnant women are a great target audience. They are worried about their unborn child and want to make no mistakes. Only if such a product is better than other products, such a publication is scientifically relevant. But this is a standard product". Professor Herber Fluhr, University of Heidelberg

,,The investigator (...) assume responsibility for all study aspects, including dissemination of study results in peerreviewed publications." Mallinkrodt Spokesperson

Conclusions
Art by Francesco Ciccolella www.francescociccolella.com

Where do those studies get cited? German federal Institute for Risk Assessment
,,It is hard to tell at first if a conference is legitimate or not" BFR Spokesperson

Where do those studies get cited? Patents

Where do those studies get cited? Climate change denial
"No one ever peer reviewed Einstein's Theory of Relativity. What do you want me to say? It's an attempt to stall without considering the content of the studies." Michael Limburg, vice president, EIKE

Implications for society
Is everyone who published there a fraudster? Is all science published there automatically bad science?

Results so far...

· Broad Debate in Society and Science (esp. Germany, Austria, France and South Korea)
· Vast amount of Q&A and Tutorials about predatory publishing (esp. Institutions and universities)
· Indian government promised to "end menace of predatory journals"

What did the predatory publisher say to all that?
"No comment"

What did the predatory publisher say to all that?
"Allegations are not true. There is a ,,peer review". Editors and authors are carrying main responsibility."

What did the predatory publisher say to all that?
"Allegations are not true. There is a ,,peer review". Editors and authors are carrying main responsibility."
"OMICS is a platform"

What did the predatory publisher say to all that?
"Sciencedomain does not follow predatory publication process. We strongly protest any attempt to label Sciencedomain International as predatory publisher."
