"THIS TURNS NEIGHBORS AGAINST NEIGHBORS AND RECRUITS PEOPLE TO BECOME SPIES FOR
THE POLICE. IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR THESE COMMUNITIES."
Cynthia Chandler, human-rights attorney, San Leandro

"While it is necessary and just to assist survivors, and expansion of those services is acutely needed, the interventions are not designed to prevent or reduce the occurrence of exploitation."

SEX WORK AFTER SESTA
 Most law enforcement response to commercial sex is driven
by complaints from local residents and business.  (At least 71% and more likely driving 90% of actions)
 Public shaming tactics drastically reduce complaint calls
regardless of whether or not actual activity is reduced
 Individual victims/survivors are collateral damage in the
larger war to "end demand" for commercial sex services
 No punitive response, up to and including a death penalty,
has effectively halted commercial sex at any time in history

Craigslist erotic services reduced the female homicide rate by 17.4%

IN SAN FRANCISCO THE AVERAGE YIELD  OF ARRESTS PER STREET-LEVEL STING  FELL BY HALF BETWEEN 2004 AND 2007
