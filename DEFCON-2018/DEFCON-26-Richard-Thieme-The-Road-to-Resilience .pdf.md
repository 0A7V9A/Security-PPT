WHAT HELPS?

When I go to disaster areas, I decompress on the way out in a non-affected part of the country so that I can see the loveliness of the land and people. After horrendous times in Indonesia, Bosnia, even Angola, I found that I was restored in the everyday rhthyms of life, coffee shops, a beer at sunset for a couple days.
In each place, local detox has helped me see the loveliness of the people and place. A week in a small town with a decent fish market after six weeks with a parade of dump trucks of bodies in Indonesia post tsunami was the last test of a strategy developed over the years. It sure beats breaking down in an upscale grocery market stateside because I got the cultural bends from ascending too fast from my first experience in a guerrilla war zone on the Thai Cambodian border. ==
