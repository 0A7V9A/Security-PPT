Court Recognizes Your Special Skills
 United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54 (D. Mass. July 22, 2005)
 Definition of Special Skills
 Special skill - a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing.
 Examples - pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts
 Not necessarily have formal education or training
 Acquired through experience or self-tutelage
 Critical question is - whether the skill set elevates to a level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that possessed by the general public.

Google and Wi-Fi

Secure Your Wireless Router

Secure Your Wireless Router
 United States v. Ahrndt, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7821 (D. Ore January 28, 2010)
 Extent to which the Fourth Amendment provides protection for the contents of electronic communications in the Internet age is an open question. The recently minted standard of electronic communication via e-mails, text messages, and other means opens a new frontier in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that has been little explored." Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc., 529 F.3d 892, 904 (9th Cir. 2008).
 The issue in this case is whether the Fourth Amendment provides a reasonable, subjective expectation of privacy in the contents of a shared iTunes library on a personal computer connected to an unsecured home wireless network.

Secure Your Wireless Router
 United States v. Ahrndt, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7821 (D. Ore January 28, 2010)
 A Fourth Amendment search does not occur-even when the explicitly protected location of a house is concerned-unless 'the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,' and 'society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.'" Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33, 121 S. Ct. 2038, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94 (2001) [*9] (quoting California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S. Ct. 1809, 90 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1986)).

Secure Your Wireless Router
 United States v. Ahrndt, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7821 (D. Ore January 28, 2010)
 Information transmitted to and from the internet is invisible to the other user of a Wi-Fi signal. Most joyriders assume that using another person's unsecured wireless connection is entirely legal and experts have pronounced it ethical. Randy Cohen, The Ethicist: Wi-Fi Fairness, N. Y. Times, Feb. 8, 2004, at 6, available at 2004 WLNR 5575601.
 In any event, accidental unauthorized use of other people's wireless networks is a fairly common occurrence in densely populated urban environments. Purposeful unauthorized use is perhaps equally ubiquitous, because, as one high-technology researcher put it, "Wi-Fi is in the air, and it is a very low curb, if you will, to step up and use it." Michel Marriott, Hey Neighbor. Stop Piggybacking on My Wireless, N.Y. Times, Mar. 5, 2006, at 11, available at 2006 WLNR 3698466.

Secure Your Wireless Router
 United States v. Ahrndt, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7821 (D. Ore January 28, 2010)
 As a result of the ease and frequency with which people use others' wireless networks, I conclude that society recognizes a lower expectation of privacy in information broadcast via an unsecured wireless network router than in information transmitted through a hardwired network or password-protected network. Society's recognition of a lower expectation of privacy in unsecured wireless networks, however, does not alone eliminate defendant's right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment. In order to hold that defendant had no right to privacy, it is also necessary to find that society would not recognize as reasonable an expectation of privacy in the contents of a shared iTunes library available for streaming on an unsecured wireless network.

Limitations On Searches of Computers
In re United States' Application for a Search Warrant To Seize and Search Electronic Devices From Edward Cunniss, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2011 WL 991405 (W.D.Wash., Feb 11, 2011)

Limitations On Searches of Computers
 United States v. Abdellatif, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2010 WL 5252852 (W.D.N.Y., Dec 16, 2010)  Searches of computers often involve a degree of intrusiveness much greater in quantity, if not different in kind, from other searches of containers; such considerations commonly support the need specifically to authorize the search of computers in a search warrant. Computers are capable of storing immense amounts of information and often contain a great deal of private information.
