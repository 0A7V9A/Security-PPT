<!--        <h2>Company</h2>-->
        
        <p><strong>Stefan Esser</strong> is best known in the security community as the PHP security guy. Since he became a PHP core developer in 2002 he devoted a lot of time to PHP and PHP application vulnerability research. However in his early days he released lots of advisories about vulnerabilities in software like CVS, Samba, OpenBSD or Internet Explorer. In 2003 he was the first to boot Linux directly from the hard disk of an unmodified XBOX through a buffer overflow in the XBOX font loader. In 2004 he founded the Hardened-PHP Project to develop a more secure version of PHP, known as Hardened-PHP, which evolved into the Suhosin PHP Security System in 2006. Since 2007 he works as head of research and development for the German web application company SektionEins GmbH that he cofounded.</p>

        <p><strong>Adam Laurie</strong> is a freelance security consultant working the in the field of electronic communications. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. Downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he and his brother Ben became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their ownâ€”'Apache-SSL'â€”which went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers) as secure hosting facilities. Adam has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997, and also acted as a member of staff during the early years of the Black Hat Briefings, and is a member of the Bluetooth SIG Security Experts Group and speaks regularly on the international conference circuit on matters concerning Bluetooth security.

        <p><strong>Julia Wolf</strong> was instrumental in the takedown of the Srizbi botnet in 2008 (at the time, the largest spam botnet by email volume). She reverse engineered every version of the bot, and precalculated all future C&C hostnames, which were then registered and pointed to a sinkhole. She has also reverse engineered several types of ransomware, broke the custom encryption used, and helped victims to recover their data.</p>
<p>More recently, she was involved with the takedown of the Rustock botnet. She has spoken at several conferences; most recently about the security aspects of the PDF syntax itself.</p>
<p>Julia first learned to program on a Commodore PET, and has been involved in computer security for a very long time.</p>
