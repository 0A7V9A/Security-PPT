Defining terms...

Synthetic Media - artificial production, manipulation, and modification of data and media by automated means

ROSE ­ Remote Online Social Engineering

Agent ­ An online entity under algorithmic control (a bot)

Avatar ­ An online representation of a human

Digital Puppet ­ The agent / avatar that is presented to the target

Puppeteer ­ The human/algorithm controlling the puppet
