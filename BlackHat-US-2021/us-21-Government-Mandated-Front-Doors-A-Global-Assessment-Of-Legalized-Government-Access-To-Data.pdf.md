Government-Mandated Front Doors?
A Global Assessment of Legalized Government Access to Data

Andrea Little Limbago, PhD @limbagoa

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

More than half the world's population live under governments who have mandated, or are considering mandating, government access to data

Historically....

The New Normal

Surveillance & tech
infrastructure

Data Hoarding

Source code disclosure

Data access requirements

Crypto wars
Data residency
risks

Lei Geral de Proteусo de Dados (LGDP)
California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA)

Data Protection

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Almost half of Africa's 54 countries have
adopted some form of data protection laws

The geography of data protection and access risk
и Borders do exist on the Internet.... и The impact of the Splinternet on supply chain risk: Data
protection and cyber risk vary by location и Which movement is gaining traction and where?  Let's quantify it!

Increasingly an overlap and more so a spectrum of policies, tactics, and norms

The current global leaders in diffusing their digital and information strategies

The Rule Setters

China

European Union

и Cybersecurity Law
и Since 2015, series of laws focused on cyber sovereignty, internet
controls, state access to data or technical support to authorities, security standards
и Latest Five-Year Plan emphasizes tech self-
reliance, data localization and government
influence over data
и Data Security Law (Sept `21) seeks to limit extent
of private data collection, while classifying private- sector data by importance to state interests 

и General Data Protection Regulation
и Focused on transparency, security, minimalization,
purpose limitation, accountability, strict standards for data transfer outside of EU
и Recent discussions of banning facial
recognition in public spaces

Global Diffusion

Turkey
и Unrestricted access to communications data
without a warrant under emergency surveillance decrees

Ecuador
и Service providers may be compelled to hand over data
or technical information required to decrypt encrypted data

и Forced appointment of local representatives, which
must be an incorporated company under Turkish law or Turkish citizen
и Forced localization: companies have less ability to
control data access, local reps may facilitate additional access requests, encryption apps blocked

и Interception of communications also permitted with a
warrant
и Following `19 breach of 20M citizens, movement toward
data protection, approved law in May `21


Global Diffusion

Thailand

Kazakhstan

и `19 law allows government official to

и Service providers must assist

seize, search, infiltrate computers

authorities with data access

without a warrant if deemed highsecurity threat

и Several attempts since 2015 to
require every internet user in the

и Officials empowered to decrypt or

country to install a digital cert, but

order data decryption

faces pushback


Global Diffusion

Mauritius
и Historically supported freedoms,
but has been growing emphasis on censoring social media
и Considering a law to intercept
and decrypt internet traffic, routing all traffic through government servers
и No judicial oversight

Cambodia
и '21 decree requires all external
traffic to pass through a government-controlled hub и Oversight by the regulatory body who also
monitors online activity
и QR code contact tracing app -> data
requested by China in exchange for telecom upgrade from Huawei


Global Diffusion

Indonesia

и Pending legislation focused on censorship also
requires companies to provide access to systems and data, potentially bypassing data privacy protections

United Kingdom

Australia
и `19 anti-encryption law requires companies
to hand over data to the government and/or create tools to bypass encryption

и Snooper's CharterГ bulk interception of online
communications, found in violation of right to privacy by European court of human rights
и End-to-end safeguards required
и 2016 Investigatory Powers Act replaced the
previous regime

и '20 proposed Surveillance Legislation
Amendment Bill

Unstructured to Structured Text
и Each question aligned and coded such that low scores reflected
less data protection/more invasive government intervention while higher scores reflected more data protection/less invasive government intervention
и Core areas:
и Data storage и Restrictions on government access to data и Data protection law and independent oversight и Source code disclosure requirements и Joint venture requirements

и Global Coverage: 189 countries or territories

Results/Findings

Opposite Ends of the Spectrum

Government Intervention
1) North Korea 2) China, Russian Federation

Data Protection
1) Iceland, Antigua & Barbuda,
Bahamas, Costa Rica, Denmark, Estonia, Taiwan

3) Vietnam, Eritrea
4) Iran, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea,
Pakistan, Syria, UAE
5) Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, DRC,
Egypt, Myanmar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Venezuela

2) Austria, Bahrain, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, Uruguay

Trends: The Good
и Almost 100 countries with data protection laws
и Many more have passed but are not yet enacted
и Accountability on the rise
и Data protection laws in one country/region are changing behavior
elsewhere
и Fines and regulatory action may be at tipping point to prioritize data
protection
и Growing global societal interest and movement for data
protection

Trends: The Bad
и If you can't block them....
и Censorship as a precursor to data access requirements
и Gaps between law and reality
и Identifying scandals that demonstrate lack of adherence to data protection
laws
и The rise of the rest
и Copycat laws and policies across all regions
и Greater interference around elections

Trends: The Hybrid

Next Steps

Change is coming fast
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Future Considerations
Data Updates!
и Stay apace changes and begin versioning and time stamps to track temporal shifts

Community Input
и Validating and based on input и Integrate regional/country-specific experts

Other Considerations
и Government/private sector autonomy и Other tech dependencies? (smart cities, underseas cables, other tech risks?)

White Paper
и Overview of the research design, methodology, and rankings
