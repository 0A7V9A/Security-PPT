Are there characteristics that identify drifters on the forum?
Are they special? Do they form a specific group?

Distinguishing Drifters
Characteristics to discriminate?
 Activity Rate  Diversification Level  Potential Business Interactions  Specialized Topics  Etc.

Distinguishing Drifters

Characteristics to discriminate? Mann-Whitney U Tests

 Activity Rate  Diversification Level  Potential Business Interactions  Specialized Topics  Etc.

 Assesses if the distributions differ  No assumptions on the distributions  Uses rank instead of direct value

Distinguishing Drifters

Indistinguishable Drifters?

Drifters and non-drifters are indistinguishable
(Based on all discriminatory variables we can think of)

The drifter population must be larger than 7%

Informal Workforce Dancing on the Crime Line Drifters Migration Mass Effect
Is there a relationship between informality and criminality over time?

Act 4 - Migration

Migration Measure
E/I  1 --- perfect migration E/I  0 --- perfect balance E/I  -1 --- no migration at all

Migration Measure
Methodology: Collect drifter data from 2012 to 2020 and compute
the E/I ratio of individuals over the years.

Migration Measure

Methodology:
E/I Ratio

Collect drifter data from 2012 to 2020 and compute the E/I ratio of individuals over the years.

Cybercrime platform only (perfect migration)

Trajectory:
The evolution of an individual's outcome variable over time (e.g. E/I ratio)

Informal platform only (no migration)

Migration Measure

Methodology:
E/I Ratio

Collect drifter data from 2012 to 2020 and compute the E/I ratio of individuals over the years.

There is a large informal workforce evolving at the periphery of the malware industry that is necessary to its operation.

They may or may not contribute directly,
but we believe they would probably rather not.

Take Away

Dig further on the mass effect and the role of informal economies where drifters are dancing on the line at the periphery of the cybercrime industry.
Think beyond motivated offenders.
