Intimate Partner Violence Gender-Based Violence

https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) (also: domestic abuse, domestic violence)
CDC: 1 in 3 women 1 in 7 men
experience physical violence at the hand of an intimate partner
Gender-Based Violence is any violence rooted in exploiting unequal power relationships

Common misconceptions about IPV Doesn't always involve physical violence Not all survivors are women, not all abusers are men "Why can't she just leave?"

Tech abuse
https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Tech abuse
Tech abuse is the use of technology to facilitate IPV
"99.3% of domestic violence practitioners have clients experiencing technology-facilitated abuse"
(WESNET, Australia)

https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Examples of tech abuse
Remotely-controllable IoT devices AirTag/Tile and other "Find my" tools Shared social media and/or email password Regular device access
Most tech is not built with the IPV threat model in mind!

Stalkerware: how does it work?

https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Stalkerware: Tech-Abuse-as-a-Service

Stalkerware is "software, made available directly to individuals, that enables a remote user to monitor the activities on another user's device without that user's consent and without explicit, persistent notification to that user in a manner that may facilitate intimate partner surveillance, harassment, abuse, stalking, and/or violence"
(Coalition Against Stalkerware)

excludes government/criminal spyware

one-time consent not enough!

Stalkerware 101
Installed through physical access to unlocked device Requires no technical skills or cybercrime connections Affordable (~US$25/month) Technically not very advanced Hidden on device Can monitor a lot of activity (phone, browser, messages, location, etc.)

Stalkerware on Android Stalkerware is most common on Android Built-in security protections disabled during installation Occasionally rooted for advanced functionality Antivirus probably detects it

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Stalkerware on iOS

Requires jailbreak so only possible on older and/or unpatched devices

Non-jailbreak "stalkerware" possibilities:
 iCloud sync  iTunes sync  Custom keyboard with built-in keylogger

Useful tools: Certo, iVerify

Stalkerware on desktop Exists, but less common Device sharing more common for desktops and laptops RATs have been used for IPV

Stalkerware: how to support someone?

https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Not a technical problem Removing stalkerware isn't always safe or desirable Understand a survivor's threat model Common prevention measures often aren't feasible
https://bit.ly/blackhatstalkerware

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Don't just focus on stalkerware
The first rule of stalkerware is that it probably isn't stalkerware
Consider other kinds of tech abuse (or non-tech abuse!) as possible causes of surveillance
CETA resources and checklists can be very helpful!

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Understand trauma
Survivors are often traumatized. This could lead to hyper-vigilance and having concerns that you believe aren't well-founded.
This isn't about you. And it's okay for you to ask for help too!
Take survivors seriously and empower them

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Stalkerware is a part of tech abuse, which is a part of IPV

Stalkerware is powerful, affordable and available

It is a very real problem, but don't ignore other kinds of tech abuse

Understand traumatized survivors. Understand this is not a tech problem

Consider the IPV threat in product design. Build connections!
