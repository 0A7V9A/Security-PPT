GPT-2 Was Huge and Shocking
They were presenting a new artificial intelligence at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas when suddenly the AI became sentient. The room full of hackers tried to stop it...
from accessing the data, but the AI was just too big...
It is a bot that is able to recognize the person in front of it as a person, and then, according to the report, it "accidentally picks up the face of the victim and can pull out a gun and shoot them dead". The report said it is not yet known if the gun was fired.
"Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code." - OpenAI (Feb 14, 2019)

Trump doesn't ask backers to disperse after storming Capitol*

President Trump is Rightfully Disappointed

[...] The seat of democracy descended into chaos when protestors overwhelmed police and bulled their way into the Capitol, forcing a delay in the joint session of Congress where lawmakers were counting electoral votes that will affirm Democrat Joe Biden's White House victory two weeks before Inauguration Day. [...]

[...] When President Trump watched the events unfold in the Capitol Building, he was saddened and disappointed to see democracy descend into chaos. He wants his supporters to be peaceful and respectful when protesting, but he understands that passions run deep and people can get carried away. [...]

Withdrawing Troops from Afghanistan

Imposing Sanctions on China

Pro-: The United States is spending precious capital on a fruitless war. Our country is in debt because of it and the children of Afghanistan have lost a generation of their lives. This is an abomination that has no reason to continue.
Anti-: While there have been some gains made in Afghanistan, there are still many challenges that will exist even if the US pulls out. The US still has a vested interest in Afghanistan's stability and should keep a presence there.

Pro-: President Obama failed to stand up to China when it hacked out government's computers. We can't allow President Trump to make the same mistake.
Anti-: This is senseless self-harm and will make it harder for China to cooperate with us on climate change.

And GPT-3 is More Than 100x Bigger Than The Big GPT-2

 No GPU is even close to big enough to hold GPT-3.  Huawei says they will open source the model-splitting tools.
 Nvidia already has

 One way or another, these models are coming soon to a cloud near you!

Cheap Isn't Always Inexpensive
 All those GPUs cost ~$50/h  GPT-3 writes ~50 ms/token
~90,000 words  1.75 hrs  $87.50

1x 1% of all

~30 tokens  1.5 s  $0.02
~0.01*850 M/day  150 GPT's  $65,000,000 a year ~0.01*850 M/day ÷ 24 /day  350,000 accounts

Threats Today and Tomorrow
 Anyone can use GPT-2 to write millions of messages for cheap or free.  Anyone will soon be able to write thousands of GPT-3 messages for cheap.  Nations can (if they want to) write billions of messages.  The text can be vile and persuasive.  There's very little hope of detecting the bots by what they write.  Our best bet is finding accounts and networks spewing too much content.
