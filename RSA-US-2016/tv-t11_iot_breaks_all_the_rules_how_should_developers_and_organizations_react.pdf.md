Devices collect, communicate, analyze, and act on data without human intervention.
This creates new value, improves customer experiences, and maybe
even saves lives...

The Good Guys...

Something Cool and Awesome

Market Rollout:
· Not Sure of Adoption Rate
· Will Anyone Target the Product?
· Deal With Issues Later AFTER success...

Massive Rollout Complete with Security Gaps

People love it!

To Patch or Not to Patch

Ethical Hackers Find Security

IoT #BreaktheRules
Break all the security rules.
Rule #1 ­ Admit you are Cyber poor. Always. Rule #2 ­ Make the IoT work for you, not against you. Rule #3 ­ Defenses are breached & there is no perimeter
to secure.

#RSAC
IoT #PrepWork - #RealProblems #RealSolutions
(1) Are cyber safety & security part of innovation & design discussions?
(2) Segment it to save it! Will the top 2 most critical assets be okay during a breach?
(3) Where can we build in a "kill switch" and when do we use it? (4) Vendors ... do we really know who they are?
Do they prioritize our safety & security?

#RSAC
IoT #SetADate - #RealProblems #RealSolutions
Next week:
Safety & Security Risk Management AND Innovation & Design on equal footing
Next month:
Segment Top 2 Assets. Segment IoT devices.
Next quarter:
Make IoT and big data work for you! Baseline IoT usage: access & behaviors.
Next year:
Track and measure this success metric-the number of times security sits at the table for innovation and design. (Message me and let me know how you do!)
