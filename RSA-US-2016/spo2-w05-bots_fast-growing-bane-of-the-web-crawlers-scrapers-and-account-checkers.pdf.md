Manage, Not Mitigate

Whack-a-mole
The bot returns but is now better hidden from detection
Evasion
Operator modifies the bot to evade detection / mitigation

Motivation
The bot is here to get something
Blocking
Prevents the bot from getting what it came for
Awareness
Blocking also alerts bot operator

#RSAC
Let's Talk about Use Cases

What are the impacts on your website and business?

What are the incentives and goals of the operator?

A bot use case is a combination of the bot operator and the business and IT impact.

your online prices, steal your customers and increase their sales at your expense

VALUE: feed competitors incorrect pricing to
maintain competitive advantage, keep your customers and maximize your online sales

What If You Could
Fool the Grey Marketers?

Your site $
Higher prices $+1 Out-of-stock X Special action

X Grey marketer

IMPACT: 3rd-parties purchase or hold scarce
inventory, preventing you from selling to real customers and reducing customer satisfaction

VALUE: slow, fool with higher prices or out-
of-stock pages, or signal to your origin to take special action on transactions from 3rd-parties

Bot Management Is a PROCESS

EDUCATION ANALYSIS IMPLEMENT

#RSAC
What have we learned?
Bots are not only a security problem. Business and IT are impacted There are good bots, bad bots, and 'so-so' bots. ...and there is always a bot operator with a specific target Just blocking bots is the wrong thing to do The way you detect, categorize and respond to bots is key to get the benefit of the good bots and avoid the problem of the bad bots Managing bots is an ongoing process, not a one time event
