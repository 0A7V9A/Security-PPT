Overview
What information is produced after a data breach? Why do you want this information to be kept confidential? What evidentiary privileges might prevent you from being forced to disclose this information in court? How do you increase the chances of a privilege protecting your cybersecurity investigation?

From: Joe Consultant

To: CIO

Re: Big Problems!

I have completed my initial assessment of your systems after last week's incident. I highly recommend that you immediately switch CRM software vendors. I have detected a number of significant vulnerabilities that could easily expose more customers' unencrypted payment card information, names, and addresses.

Also, your firewall has more holes in it than swiss cheese.

This is urgent!

Fwd: Big Problems!

FYI. I'm sure he's overreacting. Our CRM vendor is top-notch. I

should know ­ my brother is the VP of sales. I hired this consultant

to appease a few over-anxious board members, not to create more

work for us. Just keep an eye on this, but I don't think that you

need to do any follow-up immediately.

Always assume that evidence is subject to

#RSAC

discovery in court

U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Bryan (1950): "There is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving, and any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule."
In other words, you have to testify or turn over emails or reports unless a privilege applies

But cybersecurity reports and emails are

#RSAC

automatically privileged, right?

No

Even if they contain really confidential

#RSAC

information?

Really, no.
Neither federal nor state courts recognize a stand-alone privilege for cybersecurity work product or communications

#RSAC
Attorney-Client Privilege

Protects communications between attorneys and clients in the course of seeking and providing legal advice

May include non-lawyers who are assisting the attorney in representing the client

When it applies, offers nearly absolute protection

Only protects

Communications between a client and attorney

For the purposes of rendering legal advice

That are made in confidence

#RSAC
Attorney-Client Privilege
Only protects communications, not the underlying evidence Attorney must be involved and central to the communications Does not apply to communications that further crime or fraud

#RSAC
Work Product Doctrine
Unlike attorney-client privilege, which covers communications, the work product doctrine covers an attorney's work product
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3): "Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent)."

#RSAC
Work Product Doctrine
More likely to apply to cybersecurity professionals' work product
Courts have held that the work product doctrine applies to materials prepared by environmental consultants, medical device safety consultants, and insurance claims investigators

#RSAC
Work Product Doctrine
But unlike the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine is not absolute
Discovery of work product is allowed if "the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means" or if a court otherwise finds good cause to order the disclosure of relevant work product

#RSAC
Non-Testifying Expert Privilege

Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B): "a party may not, by interrogatories or depositions, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial"
unless the party can demonstrate "exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means."

Ten Tips to Increase the Odds that Your Work Will be Privileged
Subhead if needed

#RSAC
Ten Tips

1. Engage any third-party cybersecurity consultants through an outside attorney.

2. Contract and Statement of Work should be signed by attorney and consultant, not only by client and consultant.

3. Contract and statement of work should state that work is being performed in conjunction with legal advice. In the case of an investigation after an incident, the contract and statement of work should state that work is being performed in anticipation of litigation.

Ten Tips

6. Emails, memoranda, and other communications should have "ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE/CONFIDENTIAL" at the top of every page.
Reports and other work product should have "ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT" at the top of every page.
But do not overuse these designations; only label material that could arguably be privileged.

Ten Tips
7. To the greatest extent possible, attorneys should direct the work of the cybersecurity consultant. Their involvement should not be formalistic. Attorneys must have final say over all statements to outside parties, including customers, vendors, regulators, and the press.
