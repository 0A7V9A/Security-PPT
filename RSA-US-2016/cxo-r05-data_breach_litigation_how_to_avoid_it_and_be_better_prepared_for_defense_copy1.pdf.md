#RSAC
Is Notice Required?
Take a Breath. Breach - Did you indeed have a breach as defined in the law? PII - Does the compromised information fit the definition of "personally identifiable information" as defined by the law? Notify - Considering the above, is there a duty to notify? Plan - Did you have and follow your IR Plan?

#RSAC
Notice is Required: Now What?
"Sixty-three percent of respondents said notification letters they received offered no direction on the steps the consumer should take to protect their personal information. As a result, 31 percent said they terminated their relationship with the organization. Fifty-seven percent said they lost trust and confidence in the organization."

Event Response: Best Practices
Accuracy & Speed Media Management Transparency Accountability Be Thorough Contacting Regulators Using Third-Party Firms/Partners

#RSAC
Best Practices: Contacting Regulators
Consider reaching out to regulators, such as State Attorney Generals, before issuing a breach notice in order to
Keep them well-informed; Avoid misunderstandings; Avoid unnecessary points of conflict; and Request their review of the notice.
Certain states publish notice online (e.g., New Hampshire, Washington)

You took too long to notify me
You breached your promise to provide reasonable security
I would not have paid the stated price (or done business with you) had I known you had bad data security

Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)

#RSAC

But We Have To...

The basic building blocks of any data governance plan are rooted in law and industry standards, best practices

HIPAA
GLBA, FFIEC CyberSecurity Assessment
PCI DSS

ISO 27001, NIST CyberSecurity Framework, Top 20 CSC and other industry standards

International (i.e. EUPD), state laws and regulations

#RSAC
Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)
GOVERNANCE is based on Administrative, Technical & Physical Safeguards
What Your Company is EXPECTED to understand: Data they collect Where the Data is kept How it is being used, and With Whom is it Shared Obligations to keep such information secure AND ensure employees, third parties, and contractors are educated to do the same Obligations to mitigate harms and respond appropriately to all security incidents
Functions are about MORE than RISK avoidance; its about creating a culture of privacy COMPLIANCE

#RSAC
Data Classification & Data Mapping

#1 Step of any GRC Program
You cannot govern what you do not understand
Define the data in external terms Personally identifiable information ("PII") Protected health information ("PHI") ("HIPAA") Nonpublic personal information ("NPI") ("GLBA")
Define the data according to internal standard High, medium and low risk Level I, II & III Confidential, Public & Proprietary

You cannot safeguard what you cannot locate Map existing locations where PII/NPI/PHI is stored
Technical locations: databases, servers and systems Physical locations: office, floor and office buildings Don't forget the "cloud"
Map of existing data flows
Internal: between locations External: from internal locations to external locations
Map of existing applications
Internal: what functions and what data External (including cloud): what functions and what data

#RSAC
Administrative Safeguards
Drafting policies (the "why") Drafting procedures (the "how") Educate on policies and procedures
Regularly scheduled training sessions
Assessments Evaluation of competency
Awareness program (there is a difference) Programs with Documented Plans
Incident Response Plan with Data Breach Response Business Continuity Plan Security Awareness and Learning/Training Plan

Defense In Depth
Perimeter (Network Layer) Boundary Routers Firewalls Proxy Servers VPN SIEM NIDS/NIPS RADIUS NAC Gateway AntiVirus/Malware Spam Blockers

Tensions in Data Governance

Security

Privacy

Obligation to provide security for personal information and other confidential material

Rules for processing Personal Information (and analogs outside the EU)

Quick response to attacks and changing strategies
Need to retain log and traffic data for analysis

Requirements to obtain user consent and
vs. register applications/processing
Restrictions on data retention

Need to consolidate data for analysis

Export limitations on "personal data," banking information and "state secrets"

IT Operational Business Needs

Obligation to keep systems available/operational SLAs Customer experience Time to market Expense Concerns
Technology needs Retain everything Competitive pressures Internal Deadlines for Project Implementations

#RSAC
Data Governance
Finding a balance between:
Technology Operations Data use and needs Security Authority Accountability Privacy
