#2 "Rationality Will Not Save Us"
Castro knew of the missiles & he recommended their use
Khrushchev: "United States and we would have mutually exterminated each other"
Humanity saved us from total destruction
McNamara: "I want to say ­ and this is very important ­ at the end we lucked out. It was luck that prevented nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war at the end. Rational individuals: Kennedy was rational; Khrushchev was rational; Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies. And that danger exists today."

Compromise (Adapt) or Die?
"...debates have lionized threats and
confrontation and minimized realistic compromise.
[We] need to remember that the ever steely-eyed JFK found a compromise solution to the Cuban missile crisis --
and the compromise worked."

We can't find good security people,

#RSAC

because we are really good at...

Finding Ways to Say `No!" Arbitrary Discrimination Excluding Women & Minorities Deciding "We Can't!" Reactionary Knee Jerks Being Overly Cautious Passing the Buck / Laying Blame Ignoring the Obvious Expecting Different Results from the Same Action Kissing A** Drinking the P.C. Kool-Aid
We need to get good at: Finding reasons to hire the un-hireable

What is normal?

#RSAC

Do we need normal... or extraordinary?

Hire from the spectrum.

#RSAC

We need those special skills

desperately.

#RSAC
ADD - ADHD
Hyper-focus Lack of focus Hyperactivity ~16% Kids & ~5% Adults 80/20 Male/Female 75% Genetic 300% likelier to start business Often gifted, extraordinary or savant

Stop Drug Testing
Alcoholism is `acceptable'. A little weed is a Federal offense. How does drug testing help your hiring process? ADHD/ADD/OCD
Marijuana assists So does legal Methamphetamine
"No drugs at work!"

Embrace failure
Every Security Expert has failed many, many, times. You want that experience.

#RSAC
Say "Yes!" to profiling

#1 Look for Deception Background Checks?
Not Caught Yet
TSA vs. El Al Security pros profile for a living Use Profiling... correctly

"Are you ever going to cheat me?"

#RSAC

arbitrary discriminators

HR Doesn't "Like" You Fail An Aptitude Test Pregnant (Maybe) Anti-Tele-Commuting Fall Out Of The "Box" of "Normal" No Degree Too Old

#RSAC
Why else we say No! to great geeks
"I owe the IRS $50,000..." "My brother is in jail..." "I did stupid stuff in college..." "I spoke out Against/For (pick a cause)..." Credit Score Too Low "I'm a Canadian..."

Who's in competition for cyber security skills??

#RSAC
What to expect?
Social awkwardness No filter on mouth Brutal honesty Forgetting to eat Chaos < > Overly neat Body Art Odd dress "No Life"

What to give the unhireable?

#RSAC

Fairness & a Fair Chance!

Yes! You can own your ownIP Yes! You can go to hackercons An option to criminality Provide hacking targets Access to cool technology Adapted environment Support Systems

#RSAC
Defending Networks is just Too Hard

#RSAC
So...to get `the right stuff'
Halt Arbitrary Discrimination People are not the same... especially the ones you need Create new culture Don't Ask. Don't Tell Drug Policy Stop Pigeon-holing and stereo-typing Give the geeks room on their terms
Find a Way.
