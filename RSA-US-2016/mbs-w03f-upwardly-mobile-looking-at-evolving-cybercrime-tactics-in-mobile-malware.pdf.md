Introduction | Focus

Mobile Credential Theft Malware
Compromises user accounts with online banking and other services

Mobile Ransomware
Blocks access or functionality, demands ransom to restore

Introduction | Focus
Why this focus?
Recent emergence Rapid maturation Significant threats

Mobile Credential Theft Malware

#RSAC
Credential Theft | History
9

#RSAC
Credential Theft | Current State
Campaigns affecting 100s ­ 1,000s of victims likely regular Market leaders observable; competitors regularly emerge Target increasingly numerous banks & other organizations in multiple regions Compromises multiple authentication factors simultaneously Infects Android devices

Credential Theft | Injects

Windows malware "injects"

Android malware "injects"

Modify victim's experience of online Modify victims' experience of device

service or interact with service

in general or specific app

Emerged following online banking security enhancements

Emerged following mobile banking and payment apps

Diverse implementations created: circumvent MFA, record or modify displayed data, automate transfers...

Current implementation is primarily credential solicitation w/ other features used for MFA circumvention

Credential Theft | Case Study
Mazar: Latest Tool from Established Developer
Credential theft / "injects"
Overlay legitimate app or standalone window Multiple triggers
12

#RSAC
Credential Theft | Case Study
Identified targets
Services: Online banking, payment cards, eCommerce, social media, communications Regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific
Additional targets likely resulting from on-demand development efforts
13

#RSAC
Credential Theft | Case Study
Data gathered
Online Banking: Username, Password, MFA information Payment Card: Number, Expiration, CVV, Name, PIN, 3-D Secure eCommerce: Username, Password

Credential Theft | Monetization
16

#RSAC
Mobile Ransomware
17

#RSAC
Ransomware | History
18

#RSAC
Ransomware| Current State
Accounts for large share of recent mobile infections Primarily block device functionality; some encryption Linked to affiliate programs in eCrime marketplace Victims selected by country; increasingly global problem Primarily infects Android devices
Similar tactics applied to iOS through non-malware tools
19

#RSAC
Ransomware| Case Study
Simplocker: First identified mobile ransomware to encrypt victims' files Distribution
Disguised as legitimate applications, often adult-themed Hosted on fake Google Play sites
20

#RSAC
Ransomware| Case Study
Extortive Behavior
Displays locked-device warning Encrypts files on SD card: images, videos, documents
Other Features
Collects device information, likely for campaign management Jabber/XMPP-based C&C
21

#RSAC
Ransomware | Monetization
Estimated average ransom amounts: $300 to $500 per victim device Commercial ransomware kits and services enable campaign operators to customize ransom amounts Victims forced to contribute to laundering process via payment in easily-handled currency
22

#RSAC
Outlook
23

#RSAC
Outlook | Credential Theft
Geographic and sector scope of targeted services to expand Likely development focus: manipulating legitimate apps
Interact with specific apps Steal credentials users enter legitimately Modify app behavior
24

#RSAC
Outlook | Ransomware
Effects likely to remain focused on blocking functionality
Encryption of uncertain value
Tools moving into commoditization stage  potentially rapid growth in distribution and use
25

#RSAC
Outlook | Cyber Criminal Mobile Malware
Capabilities increasingly mirror conventional computer malware Increasing specialization leading to growing incidents Effective distribution tactics to be a focus Device targeting to expand slowly Conflict over maximizing malware functions and utility
Pros: Greatest benefit from overcoming installation challenges Cons: Increased support difficulty and likelihood of remediation
26

#RSAC
Application
27

#RSAC
Application
Maintain mobile device replacement capability or workaround to avoid productivity and accessibility disruptions Ensure regular OS updates to maintain security posture Develop mobile device investigation capability to assess incidents Avoid isolated data on mobile devices to limit impact of functionality loss Achieve standalone, service-side fraud detection measures to address account compromise without discernable client-side anomalies
