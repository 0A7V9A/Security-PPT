I Did Not Find It Either...

#RSAC
KBC at a Glance
 Geographical spread
 Belgium, Czech Republic , Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Ireland, ...
 Different business areas
 Retail banks, Insurance, Lease, Securities, Asset Managers, ...
 Local accountability
 IT systems interconnected ~1,600 bank branches worldwide ~36,000 FTEs worldwide, 45% in Belgium, and 51% in Central and Eastern Europe

#RSAC
Challenge: How to Take Control Over This Risk Area
Back in time: Attacks to KBC companies were happening all the time A high risk of financial loss, negative publicity, and unavailability of online banking The protective measures were no longer sufficient We work in a very diverse Group geographically, and also in terms of business and available resources KBC PEARL mission

#RSAC
Cyber Risk : The Next Gear
Mission of the Program
Get Cyber defense on acceptable level for all companies of KBC Group
Report to the KBC GEXCO (*) the status and mitigating activities of Cyber risk for the different Business Entities in the Group
Embed business ownership of Information Security in all entities of the Group
*GEXCO: Group Executive Committee

#RSAC
Group-wide Strategic Objectives
 Strengthen Cyber defense in KBC Group while respecting and stimulating the Pearl spirit
 Implement proactive threat-based Cyber Risk Management  Create an information highway to be able to respond appropriately to
trends and incidents at all levels of the organization  Check and track maturity on Cyber Risk Management: compare to
internal peers per business unit and to external peers for KBC Group  Enable to prevent and detect Cyber-attacks in KBC Group companies  Prepare for response on Cyber-attacks and for crisis management  Manage priorities in mitigation actions and guard balance between cost
& risk appetite  Prepare for reporting on Cyber Risk

#RSAC
Search for Support
Get heavyweight sponsorship within the company
Chief Risk Officer for IT+ IS (Information Security) Chief Risk Officer for Group
Get support from top managers
Country Teams (Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ireland, Bulgaria) Management Teams (Asset Management, Securities, ...)
Start a program under the auspice of top management
Group Executive Committee

Poll 1
How many levels exist between your CISO and your GEXCO/Board?
1 Level 2 Level More than 2 Levels
8

#RSAC
Model = Information Security Wheel

Information Protection
Identity & access

Chart all capabilities that have an influence on this risk
Some examples :
Cyber Threat Intelligence Analysis of threats, incidents and trends
Security Event Monitoring Correlation between events
Secure Software Development Life Cycle Making software safe, "from cradle to grave"
Forensic research How did the attack happen? What's the
damage? Build a remediation plan.

#RSAC
The Concept of Maturity

Level 1
Initial
Ad hoc, Undocumented,
uncontrolled

Level 2
Repeatable
Documented but discipline is unlikely to be rigorous

Level 3
Defined
Standards are established

Level 4
Managed

Level 5
Optimizing

Using process metrics, management can effectively steer & control

Continuous improvement

The Concept of Required Maturity
Criminal hacker surveillance
Cyber attack simulation
Basic network protection

#RSAC
Automated discovery &
forensics

#RSAC
Cyber Threat Assessment
Define Business Services Define Interfaces for each Business Service Define Characteristics of Business Services and Interfaces Define Vulnerability of each Interface per Threat

Capability Assessment
Required and current maturity level is defined for each of the 8 capabilities and 24 sub-capabilities

Required maturity based on business services, interfaces and threat landscape

Current maturity based on questionnaires & evidence
and Challenged

#RSAC

#RSAC
Methodology
Final result is a multi-year roadmap that will close the gap between Current and Required Maturity. The yearly security action plan is the part of the roadmap that will be implemented within the next year.

Cyber Resilience: Legend for Next Slides

This shows the moment in time for the presented values ... assuming technology doesn't change ... assuming the threat landscape doesn't shift ... assuming all planned projects can/will be
implemented
The Cyber Resilience shows how close this organization is compared to the maturity that is required for its specific threat landscape
