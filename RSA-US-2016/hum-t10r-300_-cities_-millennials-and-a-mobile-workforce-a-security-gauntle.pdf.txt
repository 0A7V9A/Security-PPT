MAKING THE FAMILIAR STRANGE

ANTHROPOLGY
Anthropologists may appear to study conditions that are obvious, but by making the familiar strange, they are able to move beyond commonsense reasoning and use evidence to really understand a topic.
Anthropologists ask questions about those influences outside the control of individuals. For example, if someone is successful, is he perceived as superior? If he fails, is he seen as personally lacking? A anthropologist will look at evidence and external factors that might influence a person's decision rather than accepting commonsense answers.
