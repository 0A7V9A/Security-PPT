Sliding Scale of Cyber Security

Architecture
Supply Chain, Architecting the network, maintaining/patching

Active Defense
Analysts monitor for, respond to, and learn from adversaries internal to the network

Offense
Legal countermeasures, "hack-back", etc.

Passive Defense
Provide protection without constant human interaction Firewalls, IPS, AV, etc.

Intelligence
Collecting data, exploiting it into information, and producing Intelligence

Cyber Situational Awareness
Subhead if needed

#RSAC
Situational Awareness Is...
Cyber situational awareness is the concept of understanding and visualizing the networked environment and its individual elements
to identify changes across time

Why the Adversary Wins
16

#RSAC
Tipping the Scale in ICS
Defenders should always understand their networks Adversaries should struggle to gain the same knowledge An ICS is typically smaller and more static than enterprise IT Networked OT devices/protocols less common to hackers
17

Benefits from Cyber-SA
Baseline your network
Ports, Protocols, Assets, and Communication
View your network over time
Recognize abnormalities Gain insight into ing and understanding change is very important

Challenges
DATA CAN OVERWHELM YOU

Challenges
Shiny Object Syndrome Training, education, and experience Bridging the Gap, IT and OT Organizational Buy-in
