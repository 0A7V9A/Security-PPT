Learning from Real World CISOs
I've asked each CISO to open with:
What are their top cybersecurity issues are for 2016 in their vertical, and how they plan to attack them. What advice they have for the audience.
We will then open up for audience questions. This is your opportunity to get specific and bring home information to apply when you get back.
