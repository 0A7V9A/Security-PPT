The General Security Problems of CI

Recent development of ICS from island networks to highly networked infrastructures with high integration of suppliers

More and more standardized products are used

High sophisticated attacks: organized crime and political activism; rapid changes in technologies and strong increase in know-how

lack of experiences with security

IT security solution from office/business IT often cannot directly be transferred to ICS
Many possible attack vectors, large attack surface!

Security issues special to CI
Legacy paradigm in CI networking infrastructure: for decades existence of disconnection Outdated components (e.g., OS, stacks etc.), outdated architectures Different life-time cycles (e.g. patch-management) ....

How important is Security Management in the

#RSAC

field of Critical Infrastructure?

Sustainable, effective and efficient security is only possible with

Holistic view

Considering the triangle People, Process and Technology

Control over processes and procedures

Document management

Risk analysis and management

Continuous improvement

Establish an Information Security Management System!

Classification in Protection Classes

Class 0 Consumer

Share (# of devices out of all)

·Threat: privacy of personal data, Cybercrime Expected costs: adds 5% to personal IT costs | products and vendors: achieve market trust

100%

Appropriate Mechanisms

Core Classes for Enterprises

Class 1 Companies, authorities
·Threat: Cybercrime (higher degree of risk), compliance, legal privacy protection ·Expected costs: adds 10% to IT | products and vendors: certified for effectiveness

Class 2

Companies, authorities, infrastructure

·Threat: Cybercrime, targeted attacks on corporate values, corporate espionage ·Breach of security leads only to individual damage

·Expected costs: adds 20% to IT | products and vendors: certified by internationally approved bodies

MDM, VPN, Secure Messaging, Voice and Cloud, Container solution
70%

+ Secure Operating System,

Mutli-factor

authentication, Approved

27%

PKI, End2End Encrypted

Voice, Messaging and

Cloud, E-Mail encryption

Class 3 Companies, authorities, infrastructure
·Threat: Economic espionage (intelligence services) and cyber attacks, cyberwar (sabotage) ·Breach of security leads to collective damage ·Expected costs: adds 50% to IT | products and vendors: certified by nationally approved bodies

3%
+ cost of infrastructure

+ Hardware-based 2-factor authentication (Smartcard, Token)

Class 4 Classified (beyond Restricted)
·National Security, Protection requirements: according to classification regimes
·Expected costs: adds 400% to IT | products and vendors: approved and certified by national authorities

What You Have Learned Today

At First: Analyze the security needs for the specific CI. Pay attention to the relationship between safety and security during the risk assessment!
For the ICT solution of CI take standardized products and infrastructure components in account.
For trustworthiness, consider evaluation results and relevant certificates for products and services.
Organize a Security Management System and consider the triangle People, Process and Technology.
