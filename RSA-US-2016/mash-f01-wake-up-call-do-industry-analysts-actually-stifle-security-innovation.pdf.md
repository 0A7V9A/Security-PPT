Pressing Questions for the Panelists
Is there a role that industry analysts should assume in promoting adoption of new security product categories?
How can analysts help or hurt the rate of adoption of important new product categories?
Let's talk about the Gartner Magic Quadrant (MQ). Many would suggest that if there isn't a MQ for a product category, then the mainstream market won't budget for it. Is that true? Has Gartner gained too much leverage in this influencing dynamic?
Security product innovators continue to develop new categories of products to address a rapidly evolving threat. Is the velocity of this innovation overwhelming the analyst product release cycle?
Is it more difficult for a startup to succeed if it does not fit squarely into a covered market segment? Do you agree or disa gree and why? How would you recommend products without Gartner's MQ message their value propositions?
Is there ever a willingness in the analyst community to admit, "The stuff we told you to buy two years ago doesn't actually work now?"
What do you believe the next logical product categories to emerge should be?
How have you positively or negatively impacted the adoption rate of new products/capabilities within your customer base?
For innovative startups who don't have a massive budget for analyst relations marketing, is there a proper way to approach an industry analyst to get help?
