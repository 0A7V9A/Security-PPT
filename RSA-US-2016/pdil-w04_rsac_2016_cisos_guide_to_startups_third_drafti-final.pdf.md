Note: I've been told QR scanning might not work well in this environment, so YMMV.

Why are we here?
The process of buying security products for the enterprise is broken

security start-up
noun \si-kyur --t stärt-p\
A new company you will pay to do a better job at something you already pay an older company for, though the new company has less experience doing it, there are no guarantees it will do a better job and you're going to keep paying the older company.

Why do security startups exist?

Security startup goals aren't that different

segments or environments

Getting the most out of a startup relationship through due diligence

What does `due diligence' mean to you?
That's where I send the vendor a checklist with items like ISO 27000, SSAE 16, HIPAA and PCI on it, right?
 List of references  Financial stability  Company history  Compliance  Customer Complaint history  Insurance  Audit results (SSAE 16, ISO
27001, PCI)  Contracts  Breach/IR plans
14

What does `due diligence' mean to you?
Does the product work? Can vendor claims be validated? How could efficacy be measured and compared
to other options?
15

How do you validate a security product actually works?
16

A startup-specific due diligence process

Search cycle

1 Get the big picture
· Find gaps · Determine
greatest needs

2 Create requirements
· Based on needs and resources
· Budget · Staff · Skills

3 Vendor research
· Find targets · Research
targets

Dating cycle

4 Initiate Relationship

5 Make/Break

· Start conversation
· Test product

· Does it make sense?
· Feedback loop
· Formal relationship

6 Manage relationship
· Product/vendor monitoring
· Product development feedback loop

The process
Research the startup ("Passive Recon") Engage the startup Ensure a good product/environment fit (avoid Shelfware!) This is a startup: the roadmap IS the product Proper preparation makes the most of your PoC Contracts, agreements, liability ­ rubber, meet road Uh-oh, they got acquired!
19

When you engage...

Don't shy from questions*: "We're 62
minutes into this sales presentation and I don't know what your product is."

"Plan to dump before you jump" (i.e.
Have an exit plan before you start)

You are a valuable asset to a startup; this gives you leverage

Use this leverage!

* - real story
20

Ensure a good product/environment fit

What is shelfware? Why does it occur? What ends up on the shelf?*
* See handout

Top five reasons products become shelfware according to buyers:
1. Compliance-driven purchase
2. Internal Politics (tied for #1)
3. Lack of staffing/headcount
4. Lack of time/expertise
5. Features overpromised or missing
21

Roadmap fit

Be clear: what are you willing to wait on versus need now?

Integration path ­ just APIs or deeper partnership?

Platform-based architecture?

What are the long-term goals?
Are they feasible/reasonable?

The value of security products
Can you calculate the value you should get from it?
What's the Time-toImplementation? What's the Time-to-Value? What's the True Cost?

Advice from the trenches
Q: What are some challenges to watch out for? A: Overly vague descriptions of their IP. Not being multi-platform ("oh, we'll support Macs in our *next* major release!").

Lessons learned

Why did this happen?
Small company Three engineers No Security expertise No third-party security audit

Conclusions
Due diligence of technical products requires technical assessments
Ask if a third-party audit has been performed
Consider impact and liability to other customers before taking assessment too far
Keep pressure on the vendor to fix the issue, even if you decide not to buy the product
30

Recommendations: brace for impact
Not comfortable? Don't do it, or do it through a trusted partner Don't have the spare staff/skills/cycles? Don't do it. Plan to lose most of one FTE's productivity to testing, implementation and bug reporting activities, at least initially. Look for products with a high potential reward/effort ratio threat prevention technologies, for example. Check workflow integration before purchasing!

Apply what you have learned
Later today you should:
Check out Sounil Yu's Cyber Defense Matrix Follow-On talk at 4:30pm in West 2016
This week you should:
Take the vendor marketing challenge in the expo: don't be afraid to ask questions
Within three months of this conference:
Go through the first half (steps 1-3) of the due diligence cycle for at least one product Have a few trusted sources for gathering information/recommendations on startups
Within six months:
Go through the second half of the due diligence cycle (steps 4-6) Refine your due diligence process and share your results with others if comfortable
