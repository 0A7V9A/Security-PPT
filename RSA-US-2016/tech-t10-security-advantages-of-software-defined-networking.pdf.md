Enterprise Security Processes

SDN Control: Centralized control allows
for improved security vantage point Management: Security management

improves with full network visibility

- Data Collection - Network Info - Holistic View - Live Threat

- Forwarding Changes - Network Update - Re-routing - Live Response

Applications: SDN applications provide
native security control functions Data Collection: Native collection and

SDN Infrastructure (Simplified Forwarding Devices)

analytics offer enhanced response Efficiency: SDN enables more immediate re-routing and infrastructure changes

(Dynamic Enforcement)

Retrofit: Existing networks have been
retrofit with security after-the-fact Routers: Existing router complexity
degrades response and patching Native: SDN and NFV include native
security embedded during design Integration: Security by design in SDN
results in more integrated security Complexity: Fresh SDN and NFV design
provide opportunity for simplification

Use of Cloud Can Exceed Existing Perimeter Security

Current Perimeter: Enterprise perimeter

weaknesses require immediate action

Micro-Perimeter: Virtualization enables

Public and embedded cloud micro-perimeters

Private clouds have SAME

Independence: Virtualized security works

threat profile In both private and public clouds

APT Attacks: Virtual micro-perimeters

in the cloud are resilient against APT

Equivalence: With virtual security, public

and private clouds are threat equivalent

DDOS Threat: Many enterprise networks
remain vulnerable to Layer 3/7 DDOS Layer 3: DDOS defenses rely on more
powerful defense than offense (Gbps) Layer 7: Application-level DDOs attacks
likely to increase (per Layer 3 defenses) Expansion: Virtualization allows for
dynamic, expansion under attack Consequence: Approach is similar to CDN
expansion to reduce attack consequence
