Steps You Can Take So This Doesn't Happen To You

#RSAC
Changes to Apply Immediately
Find a Leader
Place someone in charge of cybersecurity who has the backing of the CEO.

#RSAC
Changes to Apply Immediately
Patch Everything
Update all patches across the board; out-of-date systems represent the most common security vulnerabilities.

#RSAC
Five Long-Term Objectives
Know Your Data
Design and implement a data classification program. You can't defend what you don't understand.

#RSAC
Five Long-Term Objectives
Build a VTM Plan
Build a thorough vulnerability and threat management (VTM) program that will keep patches constantly updated and identify points of risk.

#RSAC
Five Long-Term Objectives
Create the Culture
Make security a culture change. Educating employees is more than sending one email a year with a simple multiple-choice test.

#RSAC
Five Long-Term Objectives
Layer Up
Implement a multilayered security environment that not only identifies and defeats inbound threats, but also watches and mitigates outbound traffic.

#RSAC
Five Long-Term Objectives
Be Honest
Decide if this is a war you can win with in-house resources. If there is even a little doubt, outsource to proven and trusted cybersecurity experts.

The Cybercrime World We Know
Mass use of drive by downloads Heavy reliance on exploits
Often with clever bypasses of novel anti-exploit controls
Still plenty of spam and phishing, links to infected sites Hacked legitimate sites used as a majority distribution mechanism

What I learned
No one believes they are getting a tax refund. Ever. People expect bad grammar in a resume/CV e-mail. Not alarming. People are `better' tuned to detect commercial identity hijacks, such as Amazon/UPS/FedEx etc. People like money. They are optimistic about receiving it even when it looks ridiculously suspicious. Some people just can't be helped.

Very few 0 days ­ mostly old stuff, but it works! Do you need Macros? Do you keep that software up to date?
New technologies come with high expectations of trust, but often over market and don't deserve their position.
For now cyber crime is the cyber crime we know and love with a few tweaks and altered behaviors, but we are entering a period of potential cyber crime innovation.
A voice of reason, non hype based focus on the changes in our industry is critical. Enjoy the talks for the rest of RSAC.
