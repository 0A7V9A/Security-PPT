#RSAC
You've Got an Incident ­ Now What?
Monitoring detects new rogue AD accounts Preliminary investigation suggests an intrusion What next? Who runs the incident? Forensic investigation reveals many technical details of the attack but fails to grasp business impact Without clear understanding of risk to company and client data, internal escalation is inadequate before client notification Company is behind the 8-ball as clients aggressively respond to potential breach

#RSAC
Classic SOC Practices
Indicators based on disk forensics and canned vendor-delivered signatures SEIM Alert Pick a number ­ address the first 40 incidents because that's what you can handle Malware focus Find the dirty box and reimage Count up the hits ­ measure by numbers An occasional hunt and campaign discovery

#RSAC
This is What it Looks Like:

#RSAC
Incident Response ­ The Old Way
OMG it's malware! ­ Manual Anti-virus Risk is all about the "sexiness" of the malware No distinction by systems impacted ­ critical business process or the soda machine Business owners not involved ­ treated as an IT issue only No criteria for severity ­ impact or technical sophistication ­ leaves open-ended decisions to analysts Anti-virus vendor, scan vendor ­ High, Medium, Low Impossible to articulate risk to executives ­ the sky is always falling The SOC ran the IR

#RSAC
Old IR Approach = FAIL
External attention to an incident requires careful handling ­ missteps can be impossible to recover from Not understanding the true impact to the business mission hinders mitigation efforts Incident is not just impacting IT ­ it impacts the business Loss of business capability = loss of revenue Reputational damage = loss of customer confidence/trust, brand damage Regulatory/Investigation = penalties and other consequences

#RSAC
Why this does NOT work...

Business Loss

Infrastructure Damage

Reconstitution

Remediation

Reputation

Not just SOC

Often other types of risk processes are used if a cyber incident affects a large amount of the enterprise/business ­ Crisis Teams

Business Driven Incident Response

Incident Response

Investigation
Immediate Response Reputational Defense
Reconstitution
Post Mortem

· Business may take over responding to the incident
· Collaboration and early education on the threat is critical
· Risk is more than losing the box · Risk is more than losing data · Risk is:
· Loss · Cost · Time · Reputation

#RSAC
Articulating Incident Risk to the Business

Cyber Risk Condition

Severe High Elevated Guarded Low

Severe Risk to the Entity's mission or function High Risk to the Entity's mission or function Elevated Risk to the Entity's mission or function Guarded Risk to the Entity's mission or function Low Risk to the Entity's mission or function

#RSAC
The Algorithm
Attack Score * (Detection + Response + Remediation + Recovery + Reputation) = Risk Score

Severe High Elevated Guarded Low

129 - 200 73 - 128 33 - 72 9 - 32 0-8

This is an example ­ you would tailor this to your organization

Scoring the Malware

AttackScore = Sum(Scores) Count(Attributes)
80 = 7.27 11 Total number of attributes = 11

Attack Attributes Prolific spreading (viral) Polymorphic Lateral movement Zero day Entity vulnerability exists Lack of visibility to detect Lack of intelligence Lack of forensic evidence Mission information exfiltration Command and Control of internal machines Spamming Campaign Total

#RSAC
Score (0-10) 10 10 0 0 10 8 7 5
10 (unknown) 10 (unknown)

Cyber Risk Score - not just the SOC

Data and Analytics ­ the Achilles' Heel

Massive amount of Data ­ just sensors ­ not including remediation/compliance

165,000 end users ­ 6000 servers

3 core enterprise domains 10 internet gateways ­ 4 OC-12s, 6 OC-3s 1B+ Log Events daily

Expensive Analysts

#RSAC
Apply ­ What Can I Do?
Help the SOC understand the business mission they protect Get the SOC access to asset data ­ what business process it supports, vulnerability state, configuration hygiene state Review your IR plan ­ what is the escalation and communication plan? Who is included? HR? Legal? PR? Business Units? Work with IR stakeholders to tune the Cyber Risk Score algorithm to your organization Use it to track risk in your next incident or IR exercise

#RSAC
Summary
Today's SOC must be driven by internal and external intelligence to clearly understand both the threat and the risk The entire organization MUST understand the threat and participate in assessing the risk from the business perspective in order to accept the risk Risk must be derived from Business Risk , IT Risk, as well as Security Vulnerability IR is more than understanding the attack ­ and loss of data ­ but what it takes to get back to business or even ­ JUST SURVIVE Targeted is scary ­ but a business that is crippled is just as scary We have all the data ­ now how do we look at it...
