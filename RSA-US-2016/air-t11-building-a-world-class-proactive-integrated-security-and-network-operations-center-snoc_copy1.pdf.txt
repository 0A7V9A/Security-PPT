Finding the Right Tools

#RSAC
SNOC Framework ­ BIC Services
Our Formula
BIC Services = Business Objectives = Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS) + Revenue ($) + Team Defined Goals (*APS) APS = Availability + Performance + Security
Quick results without initial Mgt support = Team + Existing Tools + Reports

Our Formula Increased demonstrated value = increased Mgt support (IMS) IMS = Recognition + Reinvestment

SNOC Benefits & Future Challenges

#RSAC
Apply
If you are in the process of building a SOC, and you have an existing NOC, utilize your existing NOC team and transition them to become SNOC.
Recognize similar functions between NOC & SOC and combine them.
Before obtaining Mgt. commitment, focus on your team as the core component to build successful SNOC.

#RSAC
Apply
When you add new members, focus on character and culture fit. Try to round out the team puzzle.
Do not pay for expertise; grow your own (entry level but highly motivated and trainable).
Lead from the front
Build alliances with other teams across all departments & learn from their key players.

#RSAC
Apply
Understand your business goals, traffic and users.
Filter your traffic at the edge and protect at all layers.
Shield your data center - If your business does B2C then any cloud services who host businesses can be blocked. If your clients are within a specific geographic area, then block all other countries/areas that you do not do business with.
To reduce ATOs & attacks, create WAF rules based on your traffic & customers' behavior.

#RSAC
Apply ­ Cont.
Utilize & optimize your and other teams' existing tools.
If no tools are available, then automate processes using scripts written by one of your own or another team's members.
Tune out false positive alerts and train the team to tune and modify the thresholds.
Check if the NOC has tools that are applicable for SOC usage. Example: If the NOC is using a network performance monitoring tools, check to see if the tools can perform full packet capture.
