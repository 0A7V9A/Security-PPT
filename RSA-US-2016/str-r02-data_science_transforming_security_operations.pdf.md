Data Science & Security Operation?
Who uses data science in their security practice?
In what processes throughout your security operations do you use data science?
Have you seen a significant value come out of your data science solutions?
Do you see data science playing in role in the Cybersecurity market shift: "By 2020, 60% of enterprise information security budgets will be allocated for rapid detection
and response approaches, up from less than 20% in 2015 (Gartner) "
Data Science has way more to offer than prevention & detection... It can and should be used as a key methodology and technology spanning all processes in security operations....

#RSAC
Agenda
What is data science, and why in security?
You should know by now ;) What's special about data science in security
5 Maturity levels of data science in security operations
Data science goes way beyond the prevention & detection in the entry level...
DS maturity survey
Where is your organization/product in terms of DS maturity?
Building a security data science practice in house, Yes or No? Summary

#RSAC
What is Data Science ­ in 1 Sentence
Making sense out of big data... Getting the data we collect to work for us!
Ratio
The demand is just growing...
4

#RSAC
Why Data Science in Security?
We have all (most) of the data already..... Yet still being breached... while the attacks are hidden in our data Security operations are getting too complex for humans alone... and we are facing a huge staffing gap... Other industries demonstrated huge value with DS, given a hard problem and the relevant data at hand:
Retail recommendation systems, up-sells, cross-sell Bio-informatics Image object recognition Voice recognition Self driving cars ...

#RSAC
What's Special About Data Science in Security?
Dealing with a hostile dynamic world! Human/Machine synergy High price of False-Negative errors Gathering/Sharing data Lack of labeled attacks for training and learning In security detection is just the beginning....

5 Levels of Data Science Maturity

· Aggregate

· Known bad

· Prioritize

· Adaptive learning · Automate &

· Integrated scoring Recommend

· Basic feedback · Derived feedback · Learning from analyst actions

· IoCs · Global learning · Policies

· Limit · Block · User-support

Key message: Data science is a key methodology and technology, not a plug-in feature...

#RSAC
Detection: The Holy Grail of Data Science....

The data exists, and so also endless point solutions for detection

The key to success is:
Compressive Risk Scoring

Integrated Approach

Behavior Anomaly

Entity Anomaly

Known Bad
Patterns

Risk
8

Comprehensive Risk Score - Example
Suspicious User Login Detection
Multivariate Machine Learning algorithm to detect login impersonation
Multiple inputs from multiple sources: Hostname, location, server, duration, auth, time of day, data tx/rx,....
Model output Risk score (combined measure of how risky the behavior is)
Modeling concept: Known bad: blocked users, unrealistic ground-speed, authentication User anomaly: base line per feature and detect deviation from norm Peer group anomaly: Prior knowledge, new user, acceptable behavior changes

#RSAC

#RSAC
Integrating Different Approaches - Example
Endpoint Malware Detection
The market is highly fragmented with endless point solutions Each vendor/solution takes a different valid approach with pros and cons Combining them provides enhanced performance:
Human Static analysis Dynamic analysis Community reputation

#RSAC
Augmented Investigation

The goal is not replace the analysts but augment them and simplify their work:

Shortage of cybersecurity skills continues to grow

Most of analysts' time goes on selecting what alerts to investigate

Attacks typically trigger multiple alerts throughout the different attack phases 70% of the procedures done by analysts are repeatable

Shortage in CyberSecurity Skills

The Key to success:

(ESG, 2016)

Prioritize

46%

Aggregate

23%

25%

28%

Automate & Recommendation

2013

2014

2015

2016

11

#RSAC
Augmented Investigation - Example
Top-down Hierarchical approach Pre-fetch all supporting data Risk scoring prioritization Aggregate across entities (user, devices, application, ...) Moving from alerts to attack vectors Guide the analyst with recommendations
12

#RSAC
Continuous Learning
As in any learning "teachers" are beneficial ­ supervised learning
Feeding back results to the learning engine When direct feedback is lacking it can be derived Learning from analyst behavior and actions
13

#RSAC
Leaning and Self-Improving Detection - Example
Ongoing, automatic self-learning fraud detection model

Intelligence Sharing

Tiny part of the road from each

Analytics

Map + prediction + navigation instruction

#RSAC

Waze. Outsmarting traffic, Together.
To date the industry state of the art sharing is around IoCs, next phase is to share, learn and crowdsource policies, procedures & mitigations
15

Crowdsourced security intel'
Security map + predictions + mitigation instructions

#RSAC
Fighting Back Together - Example

#RSAC
Response
Taking automatic actions based on insights:
Limit access / Require additional input
Risk based authentication Partial blocking
Automatic blocking Guide the analyst through investigation
Pre-fetch all required data Recommend next action

Survey: How DS-Mature Are Your Operations?

#RSAC

(How many fields? (5), Overall score? (22 points) )

Detection

Augmented Investigation

 Do you use
advanced, adaptive, analytics for detection?

 Can you combine
multiple alerts into some attack description?

Continuous Learning
 Do you leverage
analysts decision for operations improvement?

Intelligence Sharing
 Do you utilize
community data to improve operations?

Response
 Do you use
automatic response based on analytics?

 Can you bake into
the analytics engines your human insights?
 Do you have your
various products integrated at the analytics level?

 Do you have one
integrated priority queue?
 Do you utilize
automatic enrichments, hints, guidance or recommendation to assist analysts?

 Do you have any
level of automatic, self learning from feedback?
 Do your overall
operations improve based on your analysts work?
19

 Do your systems
"learn" from data outside of your system?
 Do you have a
mechanism to improve human actions based on the community?

 Are any
decisions or actions fed back to analysts as a results of the risk?

Building a Security Data Science Practice in

#RSAC

House, Yes or No?

Applying Data Science requires joint effort between data scientists, security experts and the business owners
To date hiring people with a data science background is hard, nevertheless with security domain knowledge
From research to an operational process/product ­ long journey from the proof-of-signal to an operational system
Data, Data, Data....
You don't want data science... you actually want data science backed into your solution in an intuitive, easy to use manner

Alignment from stakeholders
Invest in staffing and diverse backgrounds
Organization & operational breadth
Collaborate / share
Integrated home grown solution

20

#RSAC
Applying What You Have Learned Today
Take the survey and assess how advanced is your DS strategy Identify gaps, and in what area focus is needed Work up the DS stairs:
Detection -> Investigation -> continuous learning -> Intl Sharing -> Automatic response (Risk based response)
Data Science in house:
Alignment cross-org Staff wisely Be prepared for a long (and expensive) journey
Constantly strive to see how DS augments your analysts, and not try replace them!
