Opening Stipulations
It's Dangerous Out There, Fine Security Is Hard, Will Continue to Be Hard Business Goes On, With or Without Security CEOs and Boards understand safety and they understand protecting people ­ customers and employees

#RSAC
Security is Already At the Business Table

#RSAC
Business View of Cybersecurity Math
Risk = Threat x Vulnerability + Action
Potential Impact = Risk X Cost
Financial Impact = Potential Impact ­ Insurance Payoff
Cost = %Successful attacks X (Downtime/Breach costs +Response/Cleanup) + Cyber Defense "Friction"
· The goal is reduce the impact to the bottom line:
­ Reduce vulnerabilities ­ Prevent more attacks ­ React faster/more surgically to incidents ­ Restore more quickly
· "Security buys a lot of products ­ where is the connection to a safer business?"

#RSAC
Focus on protecting the business first Effectively and efficiently and quickly
Make sure the solution isn't worse than the problem Compliance must follow security
Is it Safe Enough for Us to Self-insure?

Summary of Last Year's Examples
Higher Ed - Intrusion Detection Rate increased 46%, corrective actions costs decreased 35% Financial Sector­ reduced PC reimaging due to malware from 4 per week to 1 every 3 months, and will enable the use free of AV on desktops Software ­ use of managed bug bounty approach increased critical vulnerability discovery 10x for same cost, decreased fix time. Healthcare ­ maturity in secure app dev life cycle reduced time to market for new app by 30% and reduced software development costs by 15%

Meeting Demands for

#RSAC

Collaboration

Problem: Electronic trading environment includes 40,000 firewall rules with 5,000 added annually. Two FW admins could not keep up with change requests, high error rate.
Solution: Enhance firewall policy management process
Results:
Reduced FW rule change assess to approve from 1 person-month to 1 person-day.
Reduced error rate and reduced time demonstrating compliance to auditors

#RSAC
SOC Staff Overload
Problem: Even with constant tuning of IDS system, time to discover actual incidents resulted in excessive business impact. Solution: Evaluate and update IDS architecture Results:
Daily alert rate reduced by 99% False positive rate decreased 99.8% No change in false negative rate.

#RSAC
Reducing Phishing Impact
Problem: Mid-sized European financial services company continued to see phishing-initiated incidents increase despite a security awareness program.
Solution: Use phishing simulation/testing to first demonstrate seriousness. From there engage with C-level management for support to drive behavior change and needed controls. Obtain funding for continued multi-channel effort to reduce "click on bad stuff" rate.

Speeding Up Third Party Certification
Problem: Large financial institution has over 1,500 vendors and business partners. Third party due diligence team takes too long to add new vendors and has no ability to do continuous monitoring.
Solution: Similar to lending operations, use a credit score approach
Result: Existing staff can now track 3rd party risk on a weekly basis. Able to quick start new vendors while detailed vetting in process. Extend visibility out to Business Unit management.

A Few Others
DNS Sinkholing ­ essentially free added layer of phishing/driveby protection
Load balancer/CDN filtering ­ web application firewalling without having to buy/administer another product.
SOC Tools, Services ­ skills first, but hunting automation, "playbook as a service" offerings out there as staff augmentation/force multipliers.

#RSAC
When You Get Back to Work
Make sure you are collecting the right security metrics so you can demonstrate value, improvement, danger. Any major transitions coming:
Moving to Windows 10, cloud services, mobile apps, agile dev, etc. M&A, re-org, new C-level management. Audit results
Prioritize by business impact ­ shoot for a near term win.
