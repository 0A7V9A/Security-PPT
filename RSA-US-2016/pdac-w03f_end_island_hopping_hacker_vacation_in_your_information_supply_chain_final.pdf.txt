#RSAC
Systemic...
Develop or improve your third party risk management program
Organize the relevant parties together internally (IT, legal, and procurement) Identify your third parties and prioritize them based on risk Evaluate your third parties' security posture Communicate your security expectations to third parties through contract and contact Continuously monitor critical third party performance
26

#RSAC
Technical Specifications for the SuperMax
Enforce Third Party Policy with thorough risk & compromise assessments Enforce Network Segmentation Utilize Two-Factor Authentication for privileged and unprivileged users Sandbox your cloud apps Conduct file integrity monitoring Implement virtual shielding for zero day exploits. Deploy integrated Breach Detection and Intrusion Protection Systems
27

#RSAC
What Next...
Next week you should:
Begin to assess or develop your supply chain and third party risk management program Begin to assess or develop a threat focused enterprise risk management program
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
Identify your third parties and prioritize them based on risk Develop and/or deploy intrusion suppression strategies, policies, and technology
Within six months you should:
Evaluate your third parties' security posture by conducting continuous risk & compromise assessments Continuously monitor threats and vulnerabilities through integrated Breach Detection / Intrusion Protection Systems to you and your third parties
