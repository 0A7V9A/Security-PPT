#RSAC
So...what would you say you do here?
Why are you here? What excites you about ICS security? Is ICS or security in your job now? Do you want it to be?

#RSAC
Some numbers

#RSAC
Some numbers

Industrial Control System Humans
MANY
Engineers, Technicians Operators, Vendors,
etc

Security Humans ~189,000

"LinkedIn data identified over 189,000 professionals in active information security positions worldwide as of June 2015." - Cory Scott

ICS Security Humans <1000
0.5% of Security

#RSAC
Is 0.5% enough to protect Critical Infra?

#RSAC
I'm recruiting you for ICS Security

OT Side > ICSsec

#RSAC
Operational Technology
You've got the engineering or technical background You know how the plant or process works You probably already work with:
ICS components like PLCs and RTUs ICS protocols like Modbus, Ethernet/IP, DNP3, etc Networking (ethernet, serial, including wireless) NERC/CIP or CFATS requirements

#RSAC
Get familiar with security
Learn
Security Conferences! Lots and lots of security material online (SecurityTube, etc) Security Training (ICS-CERT, SANS ICS, Red Tiger, SCADAhacker) SamuraiSTFU, Kali, Security Onion Linux Distros shodan.io
Make friends with the IT Security team

#RSAC
Make an ICS Security Lab
Many companies with control systems have labs If not, you may have spare equipment laying around...get creative!

#RSAC
So...Stuxnet happened

#RSAC
What would be your Stuxnet?
Think like a bad guy...with a hard hat! ...like an attacker has your prints Who knows...you might find a vulnerability
"To make things work well, you must break them" "Find evil, or ways for evil to do evil"

#RSAC
Red Team and Blue Team
Learn how to use Metasploit Search shodan.io Learn about Modbus Fuzzing Write some Snort rules Read up on Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

Google all the things
Modbus.org > modbus specification Tons of code on github: opendnp3, modbus, etc Wireshark Pcaps online > Netresec has a library, SANS, S4

#RSAC
Videos
YouTube & Vimeo "SCADA" "Control Systems" "PLC" Conference Talks "How It's Made" Marathon!

#RSAC
Make an ICS network at home
Raspberry Pi
opendnp3, modbus, BACnet
Arduino
modbus
$15 HMI from eBay (got lucky) ~$700 for a new Phoenix Contact PLC

#RSAC
You know security, but not ICS...yet
What I am about to tell you is the single greatest secret to go from IT Security into ICS...

Certification
There isn't a Professional Engineering license for Security... ...but not everyone is an engineer. GICSP is a new certification out to teach IT folks the basics of ICS and OT folks the basics of security.

#RSAC
You're still here
What excites you about ICS security? Do you want to join us in ICS security?

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
Identify critical components within your ICS network Find out if they have any published security vulnerabilities, or if they are connected to the IT network, or even the Internet
In the next three months:
Understand who is accessing the ICS, from where, and why
Within six months you should:
Drive an implementation project to protect the most critical ICS devices Develop a roadmap to enhance ICS security architecture Capture some ICS network traffic and look for "evil"
