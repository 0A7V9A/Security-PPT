So What?
"Big deal ­ I already know my information is available online."

#RSAC
So What?
My unscientific poll:
Outside of security, nearly everyone I speak to has no clue and are
surprised that they can be at risk to real-time physical harm.

What it really comes down to...
TECHNOLOGY - PRIVACY - PEOPLE

#RSAC
Things to take away...
Don't assume privacy is the same for everyone. Help dispel the myth that security is 100% flawless. Technology is NOT the enemy. Words through technology HURT more than you think. It takes 10x more effort to put yourself back together than to fall apart. Don't wait for something bad to happen.

Take Action...
Create your definition of privacy ­ FIRST! Expand your circle. Start a conversation with someone today by asking "what does privacy look like to you?" Embrace "beginner mind" ­ it's fun ­ really  YOU never know when you will be kicked out of your comfort zone ­ but it will happen.
