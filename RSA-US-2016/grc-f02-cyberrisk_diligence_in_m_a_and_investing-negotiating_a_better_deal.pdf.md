The Problem
Cyber security risk is considered one of the greatest risks faced by many organizations Yet, cyber risk is not typically considered in M&A or investment due diligence Results:
incomplete understanding of risk over-valuation of assets new risks for the buyer/investor

The Opportunity
Today, cyber risk management only indirectly contributes to business objectives (e.g., through nebulous measures of "risk reduction") The "Holy Grail" of cyber risk managers is to contribute directly to the bottom line Obtaining a measurable discount on the purchase price of an asset is a direct contribution to P&L
More accurate valuation of target than the competition More negotiating leverage (synergies or expected return discounted by cyber risk)

When Is Cyber Risk "Material"?

#RSAC
DRAFT

Target possesses regulated consumer or employee data (PII, PHI, etc.)
Target possesses cardholder data (subject to PCI DSS)
Target possesses intellectual property (e.g., source code, trade secrets, etc.)

7

Determining a "Cyber Risk Discount"
Cost of breach: Number of unique records x Average cost per record (Ponemon)
Annual loss expectancy: Cost of breach x probability of breach
ALE of future years then discounted to present to determine risk discount

DRAFT

Calculating Probability of Future Losses
Historical data breach loss data (becoming available as insurers track losses)
Assessment of target's cyber security program maturity (e.g., questionnaire, audit)
Organizational threat and vulnerability assessment

#RSAC
DRAFT

9

Others Factors Affecting Calculation
Presence and amount of cyber insurance coverage Reserves (ability to absorb financial costs of a breach) However, it is important to remember that reputation cannot always be repaired with money

It Can Go Both Ways in M&A Context
The relative strength of buyer's and seller's cyber security program matters If seller's program is stronger, the buyer will gain from the transaction The valuation of the seller may therefore increase

Don't Forget Target's Relationships

#RSAC
DRAFT

In an interconnected world, the cyber security stance of partners, customers, suppliers, etc. matters
In addition to assessing the vendor management program, buyers should assess major upstream and downstream players in the supply chain

12

Measuring Cyber Security Posture
Existing third party cyber security assessment processes can be leveraged (if they exist) Can combine a number of techniques (questionnaires, visits, testing, etc.) Goal: Quantify target's ability to reduce the probability of a data breach

Case Study
Large, diversified community bank acquiring a BIN rental business with nine clients As the issuing bank, the acquirer was responsible for PCI DSS compliance Acquirer leveraged cyber risk diligence to negotiate a risk discount on the purchase price

Other Potential Applications

#RSAC
DRAFT

Cyber insurance underwriting (premiums adjusted for cyber security risk)
Changes in accounting rules (e.g., discounting intangibles such as goodwill)
SEC disclosures for publicly traded companies (requiring issuers to quantify cyber security risk)

15

Application of the Concepts

#RSAC
DRAFT

Next week, you should...

#RSAC
DRAFT

In the first three months following this presentation, you should...
Gather tools (cyber risk assessment methodology, historical loss statistics)
Socialize the concept internally and get agreement to include cyber risk in diligence

17

Application of the Concepts

#RSAC
