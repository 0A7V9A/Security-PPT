Top Reasons for Rejec0on

· Presenter 0tle and/or experience
· Sales, business development, marke0ng ­ red flags
· Previous speaker ra0ngs · Session Detail!
· Leave no doubt what your session will cover and why you have a unique perspec0ve that should be the one speaking on that topic

Successful  Submissions:     GeCng  From  "Stuck  to  Success"  

Stuck 1: S0ck to current issues and trends
Breakthrough: Be original!
· The most effec0ve way to get the judges aKen0on is to show them something new and
surprising. 
· Examples of interes0ng concepts:
· "We tried to sell fake corporate data on the underground market to see how much it was worth" · "We measured something unusual about our cloud providers that is a key indicator of secure
prac0ces" · "We created a tool that correlates paKerns of posts on social networking sites with vulnerabili0es"
· Things to think about:
· Why is this topic important? · Why do you have an interes0ng viewpoint on the topic? · How did you draw your conclusions? · Why is this the right 0me for the industry to focus on this topic.
©  2015  RSA  Conference.  All  rights  reserved.  

Stuck 2: Just the facts...
Breakthrough: Be [bold, fun, provoca9ve, intriguing, persuasive, ...] crea0ve
· Show that your session will be engaging by being crea0ve in how you write
your descrip0on.
· "This presenta9on discusses some of the poten9al problems. PowerPoint will be the primary delivery mechanism, and for efficiency, 10pt font will be used to capture key points. The presenta9on will be enhanced through oral remarks followed by appropriate pauses for cogni9on. To remove ambiguity: no snacks will be served during this talk."
 · "Using social media can be problema9c. Social media is used by hackers to gain access to organiza9ons. Security
professionals should be aware of this new type of approach to insider threats. Social media can include a variety of sites found on the web." 
· "Despite its many benefits, the social web is a potent tool for facilita9ng crime. While countermeasures exist, they focus more on the aMack than the par9es involved. A novel approach to risk assessment shiOs our aMen9on to people and the online digital shadows they cast as they go about their lawful or unlawful business. Two impera9ves quickly emerge:
contain our shadows and detect theirs. "
· Which of these would you pick as a judge?

Stuck 3: All sizzle, no steak
Breakthrough: Make your 0tle sizzle...but provide the  meat and substance in your session detail 
· Remember: Judges are people (reviewing many 
submissions!) ­ hook them and then convince that you can deliver
· A good submission (like a good presenta0on) needs spice and
substance
· If you only have sizzle: remember that judges are some of the most
experienced thought leaders in security
· If you only have steak: you need to figure out how to deliver your talk
in an interes0ng way...or you may want to consider publishing a paper instead

Stuck 4: Sell Stuff
Breakthrough: Focus on important ideas, data, results,...
· Don't sell products, services, etc. ­ leverage your exper0se to
give the community insight
· The fastest way to get a submission rejected is to make it a sales
pitch
· Beware the hidden sales pitch
· The Program CommiKee is geAng really good at spoAng hidden commercials
· AKendees evaluate the commercializa0on of the session ­  don't get tagged for the future!

Stuck 5: Leave your personality and your passion out of your submission
Breakthrough: The passion for what you do should come through in your submission.
· Example: "This project began with the assump9on that
individuals and organiza9ons leave data on electronic data storage devices when they disposed of them. These assump9ons were confirmed using simple and advance digital forensic techniques, tools, and soOware, many of which are freely available on the Internet."
· Think this guy is interested in this topic? Do you think you might
be interested too?

Stuck 6: Use the senior marke0ng/sales person
Breakthrough: Line up the speaker's exper0se with what they deliver.
· VP of Marke0ng talking about reverse engineering malware? · Even if the CMO was the CTO before the 
acquisi0on, aKendees may avoid the  session due to marke0ng job 0tle.
· If the speaker is good but doesn't have a 
technical 0tle, add a technical co--speaker

Stuck 7: Don't go the distance
Breakthrough: Complete the en0re submission!!
· Make sure that:
· Proposed panelists/co--speakers are confirmed · You fill in all the form fields · You make the "session detail" different from the abstract
· Most incomplete submissions get rejected ­ make sure
you have filled in all fields
· If an agency or marke0ng is doing the submission for you,
help them!

Bonus Stuck: Don't Submit 
Breakthrough: RSA Conference speakers actually submit within the Call for Speaker deadline
· Even if they get rejected one year, they try again and
usually get accepted in the future
· Start small
· Submit for a P2P session (opens Oct 8) · Submit a crowdsourced proposal (opens Dec 2)
· If you get rejected, ask why
