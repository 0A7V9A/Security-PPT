Why I ask what is "Digital"
...because over the past 40 years, many new technologies have been introduced which have caused
disruption and met a definition of digital.

#RSAC
Why I ask what is `digital'
neither technology today requires the `digital' prefix.

#RSAC
So what is Digital?
Author Ronald Tocci in his book Digital Systems: Principles and Applications defined it as below.
"digital system is a data technology that uses discrete
(discontinuous) values"

#RSAC
What is all the fuss about?
It is about
creating a distinctive customer experience staying ahead of the competition by increasing efficiency finding new routes to market. discrete datasets bringing discrete datasets together to create actionable insights maximising investment in systems and processes

Strategic Enablement

#RSAC
Tactical Agility

What was achieved
Rapid deployment of mobile customer engagement applications

Where pain was felt
Rise of shadow IT weakened their backend technology processes

Creation of Omni channels for enhanced selling
Analytics based customer segmentation
Moved towards data-driven decision making

Lack of security controls for customer data
Sub optimisation of security architecture
Limited understanding of deployed cloud capability

Business lead deployment of cloud capability

and then...

#RSAC
HACKED
...stuff was lost...
18

Strategic Enablement
What was achieved
Cloud first strategy was adopted
Streamlined processes enabled service standardisation
Supplier assurance was revamped with significant focus on data security and cloud controls
Operational maturity was the cornerstone of Digital using ITIL as a foundation capability
19

#RSAC
Operational transparency assisted with the enablement of shared digital services Cross-channel integration was achieved as business and IT were integrated with IT as a service broker Data security was introduced as a nonnegotiable Digital and cyber were elevated to the board for discussion as an enabling capability

#RSAC
Strategic Enablement

Where the pain was felt
Business understanding that without cyber maturity Digital enablement was at risk

Justification for increase in spend supporting cyber security capability

Business case and funding for process maturity based on previous experiences
Realisation that Digital is a business transformation initiative
Understanding of the limitations of what data analytics can actually deliver for the business
20

Shift within the IT function from an architect and operate mindset to a service broker and integrator
Support functions awareness and uplift to think about customer data security and privacy
and after all that...

Bringing it together ­ how do I apply this?

#RSAC
­ your key questions revisited
Question 1
NO · How is digital (disruption) and/or cShILaVnEgRe affecting our organisation?
BULLET
Question 2
· How well are we responding to minimise the threats and maximise the opportunities presented by this change?
23

#RSAC
What can I apply tomorrow
Integrate cyber & digital Spend on process maturity
Strengthen governance and reporting
24

#RSAC
Integrate Cyber & Digital
Identify areas where digital projects are taking place across the organisation and ensure there is an understanding of cyber security obligations
Assist business in understanding why spend on cyber security is required to increase as they embrace digital where data is key
Undertake business awareness campaigns to ensure the threat landscape and data security risks of digital enablement are understood by the business
Initiate discussions with the organisations executive leadership and board to ensure digital enablement is not happening in isolation.
25

#RSAC
Spend on Process Maturity
Understand that "Cloud" is intrinsically tied to Digital Have an appreciation of support processes that will enable the use and consumption of cloud Identify core processes required to support cloud enablement and agile development Set up a data security function that focuses on managing risk to data assets
26

#RSAC
Spend on Process Maturity
Ensure process maturity effort is not in isolation and supports standardisation  across architecture  operations  projects
When talking process maturity most organisations default to using ITIL in some shape or form.
at a minimum focus on the following 10 processes for digital and cloud enablement.
27

#RSAC
Process Maturity
ITIL based processes for digital enablement
28

#RSAC
Governance and Reporting
Security governance is key given the change in threat profile of an organisation
Implement vigilance and resilience controls given the increase in and organisations attack surface following Digital enablement
Ensure there is business awareness of the changes in risk posture across the Digital transformation landscape
Risks related to cyber attacks, confidentiality and regulatory breaches, brand exposure and data security should be reported at the board level
Use data enabled insights based reporting of your organisations security posture.
