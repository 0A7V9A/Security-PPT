Best Practices ­ How to Prepare

Immediate Turn Around
Adopt a security framework and implement it (COBIT, ISO27001, NIST, Cyber Security Framework, etc.)
Develop and deploy a robust internal security policy
Ensure a governance process is in place
Document and retain artifacts of that governance

Continuing Long Term Approach
Implement a data classification program Discover and document data locations Implement Data Theft Prevention tools to protect critical data Deploy tools to detect and protect against Insider Threats Deploy tools to provide full visibility
