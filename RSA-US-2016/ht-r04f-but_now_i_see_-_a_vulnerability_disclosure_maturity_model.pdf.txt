Measuring Our Maturity

How would you answer these questions?
When someone emails security@mycompany, who responds? How quickly?
Would my company's legal department threaten a well-intentioned hacker who came to us with a valuable bug?

Measuring Our Maturity

Does engineering prioritize the importance of product features alongside security bugs that come in from the wild?
If a reporter asked my CEO about a breach reported at our company, would she know what steps were taken to ensure user safety?
Is $10,000 is too much, too little, or just right to offer a hacker for a bug?
