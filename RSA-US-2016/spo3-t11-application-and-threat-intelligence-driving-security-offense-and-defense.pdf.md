We've Evolved?

Changing Every Day

#RSAC
IPv6 LTE ­ 5G New Apps SSL Cloud Content Centric Networking
All of these add new code/libraries, bugs, and more opportunity for hackers

#RSAC
Attacks Evolved?

Morris Worm Buffer Overflow
1988

CVE-2016-1287 Buffer Overflow
2016

We're still introducing the same old bugs in our code

DEP & ASLR makes exploitation more difficult
Plenty of programs/libraries/systems still not supporting ASLR/DEP

Pre-Production/Production Validation
Do you trust the vendor data sheets?
They are correct, but...
Disclaimer: No vendor bashing meant, they all do it

Time for a Story
There once was a man from Nantucket... Have you heard this one before?
He was saved by testing an update before applying to production!

Customer Use Case
Product Evaluation ­ Multinational Corporation Customer
· 100,000 Employees
· Focused on energy, consumer, and finance
Need
· Maximizing reliability of network upgrades
· Ensure "No Surprises"
Results
· Customer was able to avoid a patch that would have reduced performance by 80%

#RSAC
Reduce risk of exposure

Don't be the low hanging fruit

Lifecycle: Production/People Processes
Are you a control freak?
· You cannot control all the code · You cannot control weakness in Security products
You can control...
· Noise by Reducing Alerts through... · Reduced Attack Surface · Access to/from Known Malicious Systems

Security Architecture

#RSAC
What is Worse than No Data?

#RSAC
Find Out Before They Do
Visibility Architecture Matters
Taps vs SPANs Decryption support NPB performance IDS performance
What is the impact?
Nearly 50% more threats went undetected by IDS Specific to the deployment Test it yourself!

Next Steps
Subhead if needed

#RSAC
Next Steps - Evolve
Don't just trust, but verify
Design full security architecture, don't just focus on the analysis tools Validate products, processes
Lower your
Attack surface Noise operations must deal with everyday
Don't be the low hanging fruit Know what's in your network, and lessen time to detect compromises
