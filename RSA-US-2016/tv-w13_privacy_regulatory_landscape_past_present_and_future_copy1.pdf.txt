#RSAC
Will We Let Reality Destroy Our Rights?
Technology is taking away your privacy.
Will it dissolve your RIGHT to privacy in the U.S.A.?

#RSAC
Today's Roadmap
What is the Reasonable Expectation of Privacy? How are Advances in Technology Killing it? If we can never reasonably expect privacy, what happens?

What is the Reasonable Expectation of Privacy?

#RSAC
Why should we care about a legal standard?
We use it to decide whether
the FBI can take your DNA without your permission and without a warrant

#RSAC
Why should we care about a legal standard?
We use it to decide whether
your boss can read your email

#RSAC
Why should we care about a legal standard?
We use it to decide whether
the police can look in your smartphone

#RSAC
What Is a Legal Standard?
The Dividing Line Between Privacy and Intrusion

#RSAC
Is the Standard in the U.S. Constitution?
NO
4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated"

#RSAC
So Where Did the Standard Come From?
An 1890 Harvard Law Review Article: "The Right to Privacy" The authors worried that the newspapers were gossiping about their society wives in Boston.

#RSAC
What is the Reasonable Expectation?
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928) Brandeis' Dissent
Wiretapping case: New Technology: Telephone Defines the "right to be let alone--the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by civilized men."

#RSAC
How is the Standard Used Today
To decide Constitutional search cases
To limit warrantless police investigations
To measure intrusiveness of employers and the press

How are advances in technology killing the Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Standard?

#RSAC
What was Reasonable Privacy in 1890?
Privacy of action was Everywhere Electric light only in a few cities Distance seen only from balloons Cameras only worked if you stood still

#RSAC
. . . And Now
Some people never experience absolute dark
18

#RSAC
. . . And Now
We are all tracked by global and local systems
Mobile tracking -- Phones, cars, clothes Stationary sensors -- Home, road, office and retail establishments Connected computers ­ sending information to be collected/analyzed

#RSAC
. . . And Now
Digital Cameras everywhere ­ Metadata

#RSAC
. . . And Now
Entirely new life online ­ much of it captured

#RSAC
. . . And Getting Worse
Tracking Systems moving to more devices Facial/Voice/Gate Recognition and other biometrics

#RSAC
. . . And Getting Worse
Online providers becoming more sophisticated Official records kept of transactions Increased mixing of real world and cyber world

#RSAC
With Each Advance in Technology
Constant Pressure from Law Enforcement to Intrude on Privacy

#RSAC
How Can it be Reasonable?
To Expect Any Kind of Privacy in this World?
Becoming less reasonable all the time.

If we can never reasonably expect privacy, what will happen?

#RSAC
What will happen?
We have two choices:
No privacy protected by law Choose a new standard

#RSAC
Could we choose a new standard?
Yes, of course we could
REOP is not enshrined in the U.S. Constitution Other nations use different standards

#RSAC
We could choose an objective standard
Certain acts, matters and behaviors are declared to be private when conducted in a private space
Exclude government from collecting and viewing data about these behaviors without a warrant
Intrusion of passive technology does not affect "private space" calculation

#RSAC
We could look abroad for a test
European Protections
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950):
"Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." ­ Article 8
Objective tests for government intrusion and business intrusion.

#RSAC
In any case, we should discuss alternatives
Before our scope of protectable privacy shrinks and shrinks until there is nothing important left to protect.
