Why?

Smart people

Time limited

Non-technical

Talking to the C-suite or the board is cbhrailllieangt ing

Smart people

Get risk

Perspective

Who grasp concepts quickly and can apply them to the current situation

But we've spent $x million over the past n years making sure this won't happen to us ...

What's this got to do with cyber security?

#RSAC
"there's no such thing as common sense, just common knowledge"
Ira Winkler, RSA Conference 2012

#RSAC
"our metaphors comprise the conceptual spectacles through which we view the world"
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason 1781

#RSAC
Why is fire a great metaphor?
Societal knowledge Fire is an opportunistic threat Fire does not care what you did yesterday (or plan to do tomorrow) Fire is happy to exploit the smallest vulnerability Fire does not stop until it absolutely owns everything (Until there are no more assets to compromise)

Effects
13,200 Homes 75,000 Homeless 80% of the City of London destroyed 10 Dead Affects the British economy for years

Chicago 1871

#RSAC
But this is 1871
17 horse drawn fire engines 180 fire fighters 1 pumping station (but with a wooden roof)

#RSAC
Effects
120 miles of wooden sidewalk burnt 33% of buildings destroyed 100,000 people homeless

Metaphors and lessons
"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"
George Santayana, The Life of Reason 1905

#RSAC

28

#RSAC
"Perfect threat storm"
Very dry Strong winds
29

#RSAC
Prevent

London
Vulnerable construction of basic components. Wood & straw
No segmentation. Narrow streets, overhanging buildings
Manual controls

Chicago
Better construction but significant vulnerabilities: tar roofing, decorative wooden cornices and advertisements
Segmentation easily defeated. Wooden sidewalks, wind blew sparks across the river
Manual controls

30

#RSAC
Prevent

It is too late to fix architectural

problems when you're on fire

Unpatched applications?

Flat networks

Too many
admins? Vulnerable
OS?

31

#RSAC
Detect

London
Detection too late to prevent total compromise of the asset.

Chicago
Detection too late to prevent total compromise of the asset.

32

#RSAC
Detect
There is a `golden hour' Treat every incident as unique
33

#RSAC
Respond

London
Strategy relied on sacrifice of compromised asset and neighboring assets. Unprepared to follow strategy
No plan B. Everyone acted individually. Lack of skilled resources. Lost control quickly.

Chicago
Strategy relied on fast response to limit fire to a single asset. Too hot, wind too strong so fire spread too quickly on wind
Response mechanisms vulnerable to attack. Wooden roof on pumping station

34

#RSAC
Respond

Be decisive What if your response

Are there known issues?

mechanisms are vulnerable?

35

Recovery: individual

CHICAGO: Wooden sidewalks, wooden advertisements BOTH: Sparks carried on the wind defeated firebreaks CHICAGO: Fire safes that were not PROBABILITY: Dry, strong winds, failure of manual preventative control
