Innovation In Network Security

#RSAC
Innovation In Network Security Is ...
Visibility & Control
The application of people, process and tools delivered as a service and as a set of products Threats are mitigated as close to the source as possible
Security services are dynamically chained together and instantiated to form a service chain to mitigate a specific threat and/or to provide a managed security service on distributed compute resources
Threat defense provides a distributed capability to mitigate threats ­ targeted at the network, the Data Center, the Cloud and the applications that they serve

Stuff To Think About
What do we do as encryption becomes more and more pervasive? If it's about visibility ... When it comes to NfV and SDN, do I go open source or build it myself? How do I securely have an application connect to the network to deliver a customer outcome?

Let's "Apply" What We've Learned

Visibility + Controls = Secure Outcome

Behavior Baseline & Analytics

Everything We Do to Mitigate an Attack

Innovating Delivery of Secure Outcomes

Security Innovation = {People, Process & Tools}

#RSAC
What Should You Do Now?
When you leave today, you should ask yourself:
What can you see on the network, what you know and how you can validate it Once you have a good working baseline, do you have a policy that defines acceptable behavior and business priority How quickly can you get the mitigation controls in place? Applications want to talk to your network... Are you ready? How thorough is your capability to learn after the attack? Am I prepared to be innovative in Security?
