Discussion Topics
What's our state of security? Where do we enforce security? Can we get ahead of attacks?

Are we secure?

Detection

#RSAC

Is our security posture effective?

Remediation

Can we predict attacks?

Not there yet.

FIREWALL

#RSAC
Last 20 years of security:
Got a problem?
BUY A BOX

SIEM IDS PERSISTENT THREATS DLP WEB SECURITY EMAIL SECURITY VPN FIREWALL

#RSAC
The OLD security stack...

#RSAC
Complexity is compromising us.

#RSAC
We need simplicity

#RSAC
But simple isn't easy

#RSAC
Where Do We Enforce Security?

#RSAC
The Shift from Old to New

Critical Infrastructure

Desktops

Business Apps

The Shift from Old to New
Remote Users

Laptops / Tablet Users

Critical Infrastructure

Desktops

Business Apps

#RSAC
Critical Infrastructure (Amazon, Rackspace, Windows Azure, etc.)
Business Apps (Salesforce, Marketo, DocuSign...)

You Cannot Rely on the VPN

Last 20 years of

off-network security:

REMOTE

VPN on

ACCESS

#RSAC
You Need a New 24x7 Security Landscape
But the VPN is not on 24x7...
VPN off

#RSAC
You Need DNS-Layer Network Security

DNS is the

Internet's

VPN off

DNS Works on Any Device, Anywhere

BENEFITS
Global Internet Activity Visibility
Network Security w/o Adding Latency
Consistent Policy Enforcement

BENEFITS
Reduce alerts by 2-10x Block malware before it hits the enterprise Contain malware if already inside

DNS is the Easiest and Fastest way to Establish a 24x7 Security Landscape

#RSAC
Can We Get Ahead of Attacks?

#RSAC
Yes. But It Requires Internet-Wide Visibility.

#RSAC
First, Gather a Significant Percentage of All Internet Activity in Real-Time

Second, Identify New Patterns by Applying Human Intelligence to Data Visualizations

#RSAC

#RSAC
Third, Automatically Identify Where Attacks Are Staged by Applying Statistical Models to The Data
DOMAIN IP
ASN

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned today

VISIBILITY
see all the traffic

ENFORCEMENT
24x7 security landscape

MANAGEABILITY
consistently adapt

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned today
Next week...
start gathering your DNS logs for visibility evaluate how often laptops connect off-network
Next month...
find a non-VPN/proxy solution to extend network security beyond the perimeter
Next quarter...
start analyzing your DNS logs for threat intelligence
