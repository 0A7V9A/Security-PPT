How to Reduce Your Risk
Don't carry your SSN card or any document with your SSN. Don't give a business your SSN just because they ask ­ only when absolutely necessary. Check your credit report quarterly. Check your Social Security Administration earnings statement annually. Protect your personal computers by using firewalls, anti-spam/virus software, update security patches and change passwords for Internet accounts. Don't give personal information over the phone, through the mail or the Internet unless you have either initiated the contact or are sure you know who is asking.

Thank You
