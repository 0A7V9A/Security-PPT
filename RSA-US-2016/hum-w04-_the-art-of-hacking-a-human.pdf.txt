The Art of Hacking a Human
First Impressions: Based off perceived stereotypes Humans can be programmed: They set up their own internal firewalls with interaction rules Do we want to allow or block this person in our comfort zone?
2

#RSAC
Attack Path
External reconnaissance ­ internet searches, social engineering, "dumpster diving"
Initial breach (breaking in) ­ scanning, open ports, services, vulnerable apps, weak protection of data transit
Escalate privileges ­ exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration, taking advantage of programming errors
Persistence ­ breach undetected for a long period of time
3

#RSAC
Attack Path
Internal reconnaissance Lateral breach ­ need users with more access, more admin rights to relevant services and servers Maintain presence Achieve objective
4

#RSAC
Reconnaissance
Collecting information about an intended human target: Do your research Check their desk Ask around Watch them in the cafeteria Look at previous work history
5

#RSAC
Initial Breach: Breaking Into The Human
Determine what "operating system" they are running: What patches are in place? What vulnerabilities can you exploit?
What "configuration issues" does this person have?
6

#RSAC
No Luck: Why?
Discover that there are different personality types Learn the different types of personalities Learn to adjust in order to know how to interact with that person
7

#RSAC
Understand how People Operate
Most people are social creature Most people want to be a part of a group How can you leverage that

#RSAC
Focus On You
The way you view things Why you don't like them The way you communicate can change how you get along
"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle." ~ Ian MacLaren

Different points of view will differ from the location and perception of the Subject.
11

#RSAC
Escalate Privileges
Taking advantage of their flaws. Persuade the Target:
Demonstrate Honesty and Respect By: Meet with them ­ have a list of things you want to accomplish while on the same team Ask target how you could earn their trust Ask if they need help with assignments Invite to lunch Ask questions pertaining to them
12

#RSAC
Ego Defense Mechanisms
Different defense mechanisms helps identify the person. Lash out: Get protective to protect their pride even though they know they're wrong No insight they are wrong. Or, they know there is a chance they could be wrong, but they won't admit wrong
13

#RSAC
Micro Expressions
Clues people give up are on their face; impossible to control. If you can read these clues, you'll understand where the conversation is going
Are you connecting? Are they comfortable?
14

#RSAC
The Reason They Don't Like You
May not be valid Could be stereotypes Break those stereotypes
15

#RSAC
Persistence
Will not happen overnight; it is a gradual process. Find a mentor and ask for advice Network using target's mutual friends
16

#RSAC
Lateral Breach
A hacker will need more intelligence that come from data points. Mutual friends
17

#RSAC
Achieve Objective
As a User, you will be able to work with different Personalities based on what the Hacking results tell you
18

#RSAC
The Bad Boss
Goes by the book and micromanages. Acts a certain way because they have not been shown respect and have received negative feedback. Difficult to beat in a match, you can't just flip the board and walk away.

#RSAC
Throughout The Hacking Process
Remember that communication is the key If you cannot help somebody at least don't hurt them
"People fail to get along because they fear each other; they fear each other because they don't know each other; they don't know
each other because they have not communicated with each other." ~ The Dalai Lama

#RSAC
Winning The Hacking Game
Respecting all religious traditions Exploiting and bullying will never win you any real friends Kindness and compassion will give rise to self confidence, which empowers you to be honest, truthful and transparent.
23

#RSAC
We Are All The Same
"And while on a secondary level differences exist of nationality, faith, family background, social status and so on, more important is that on a human level we are the same. None of us wants to face problems, and yet we create them by stressing our differences. If we see each other just as fellow human beings, there'll be no basis for fighting or conflict between
us." ~ The Dalai Lama
24

#RSAC
You Are Confined By The Walls You Build
Look at yourself, the stereotypes people notice The way you talk to people Your perceptions Do you let the way people treat you become the way you treat others
25

#RSAC
You Attract
The only time someone can drive you crazy is if you are willing to be their passenger. Reciprocal socialization: This is what parents to do teach their kids to be adults. Employees: The way you talk is the way you want to be treated Socialization ­ negative/positive
Any Company ­ Employees ­ Different Personalities ­ Success

This talk will help you realize that sometimes we are the problem and not that other person. Learn to gather your information about that person before jumping to conclusions of why they don't like you. Look at the cultural environment you are in, is this why that person is the way they are? Use technical and non-technical techniques to get along better with people. Use positive energy
28

#RSAC

Look at the way you treat others. Understand how people operate. Be able to understand different personalities based on somebody's micro expressions, ego defense mechanism and understand that the way you socialize with people sets boundaries and limits on how they interact with you
