Presentation Areas
Security ­ what is it? Threats ­ what to look out for Encryption ­ how does it work Random Numbers ­ what and why?

#RSAC
Security ­ Why You Need It

#RSAC
What Security Means
Keep it safe or keep it private? Share only what needs to be shared
4

#RSAC
Keeping it Safe
Not all attacks are malicious (human error, spam, data farming) Malicious attacks are to take data/to cause damage to system
5

#RSAC
What About The Bad Guys?

#RSAC
Threats
Threat to Confidentiality Threat to Integrity Threat to Availability
7

#RSAC
Types of Harm

Interception

Interruption

Modification

Fabrication

#RSAC
Matter of Trust
Can you trust the hardware? Can you trust the software? Can you trust your users?
10

#RSAC
Attackers
Amateurs Hackers & crackers Commercial crime Cyber terrorism State-supported information gathering
11

#RSAC
Multi-Layered Defense

Medieval Castle
Location (hill, river) Moat Wall & gatehouse Watchtowers Guards

Computer Data
Physical Technical Policies & procedures Software & hardware

#RSAC
What About Encryption?

#RSAC
Encryption Through the Ages...
Trusted couriers Hidden messages Early cryptography - readable to unreadable Using codewords
14

#RSAC
Spot the Connection?
15

#RSAC
First Randomizer - Enigma
The Enigma Machine
From three rotors of a set of five, the rotor settings with 26 positions, and the plugboard with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma had 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 settings
16

#RSAC
Breaking Encryption
Break single message ­ look for patterns Infer knowledge without breaking encryption Predict the key to break future messages Find vulnerabilities in the encryption algorithm
17

#RSAC
Breakable Encryption?
Message with 25 characters: INFORMATION SECURITY TALK
2625 (=1035) possibilities
Brute force attack:
1010 decryptions per second on 1035 possibilities = 1025 seconds (10 billion years)
Statistical analysis
= 105 seconds (1.2 days)
18

#RSAC
Using Encryption Today
Computer = deterministic, operations can be predicted Public key = random number Random number = non deterministic, cannot be predicted
19

Symmetric Encryption
Only sender and receiver know the key
Sender
Need to keep the connection secure
20

Asymmetric Encryption
Public key ­ encryption key Private key ­ decryption key

#RSAC
So How Are Random Numbers Used?

#RSAC
What are Random Numbers?
Random numbers cannot be normally predicted Pseudorandom numbers ­ pattern repeats over time Be careful: no discernible pattern ­ might not be apparent to users
23

#RSAC
Entropy
Measure of uncertainty in the information

Entropy in language
English vs. German/French ­ reasonably similar English Vs. Chinese ­ Chinese has approximately 3 times more entropy than English
24

#RSAC
How Random Numbers are Used
All encryption needs a key More random the key, the harder to crack the encryption All encryption starts with a seed
25

#RSAC
Where Can You Get Entropy?
Truly random sequence ­
Electrical current of TV signals Internet radio CPU load measurements
ENIAC ­ first random number collector
26

#RSAC
After All That, What Do YOU Need To Do?

#RSAC
Methods of Protection
Prevent Attack Deter Attack Deflect Mitigate Detect Recover
28

#RSAC
Improve Your Encryption
Get a good random number generator Gather highest possible entropy Secure source of entropy Multiple and constant sources of entropy Remember Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability
29

#RSAC
And That`s It
Thank you for your attention Any questions?
