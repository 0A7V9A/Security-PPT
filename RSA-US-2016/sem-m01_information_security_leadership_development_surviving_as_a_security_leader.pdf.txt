Ask for More Than You Expect to Get
Henry Kissinger said when speaking of international negotiation, your ability to get what you want depends on your ability to overstate demands.
There are several reasons for overstating your demands: You might actually get it It raises the imputed/perceived value of what you're offering It's easier to negotiate (down) to what you really want It can prevent deadlocks with someone who always needs to win

Boards by the Numbers
75% of Boards have no part in reviewing security and privacy risks. 32.5% of Boards do not receive any infosec information. 55% of Boards do not receive routine security updates. 45% say even though it is on the agenda it is not important. 65% support punishment such as fines for a data breach. 1/6th of security professionals advocate prison sentences for CEOs and Board members after breaches!

#RSAC
Questions that Need Answers
Is Cyber risk accounted for in the corporate planning process? What is the process for evaluating security and privacy? And measuring liability? Do we have Directors with relevant experience? Do we have identified executive ownership? What happens in the event of a breach? What happens in the event of a vulnerability in the technology we created ?

Board Discussion Coaching Tips

Learn What Works

Explore with others who have presented

Know Your Audience

Who are your Board Members?

Careful to not use `security geek speak'
Discover their background

Seek out stakeholders for input and potential pre-review (Marketing, IT,Legal, Mfg., Corp Affairs, Public Policy, Business GM's
Know what you want them to walk away knowing or understanding

35

#RSAC
Know Your Role

Avoid `the sky is falling' messaging ­ don't be a fear monger

Conversely everything may not be rosy ­ don't give false sense of security

Have an objective, thoughtful discussion on risks & how every aspect of the company is handling them: the shinning lights and areas that need additional focus

Leave them with confidence, you understand your role, you have the leadership as well as independence/objec tivity to manage risks across the company

36

#RSAC
What to Present

Determine scope (wide angle view) then rescope to the critical few hot or emerging topic areas Internal operations, external facing systems, products/services, IP protection, privacy, availability risks...

Make the connection to your Enterprise Risk Map and the 10 Universal Business Risks

Share notable events, issues, excursions & lessons learned
Highlight you will never be incident free & give confidence of your ability to handle

Don't ask for money ­ generally not the Board's role
Provide data & indicators and have back up with more data
Budget time, material, Q&A and discussions

37

#RSAC
Presenting Your Information

Understand your business and key drivers of the business model ­ how does it connect with cyber & privacy risks

Distill complex topics, don't hide the complexity, show you understand and simplify (recent & newsworthy cyber/privacy items)

Never read the slides...tell the story and use material as your props
Practice...Practice...P ractice ­ avoid surprise questions

Have an executive summary & consider a 3-5 page white paper sent a couple weeks beforehand

38

#RSAC
Closing Thoughts
Understand: Who you work for vs. Who you report to
 Don't get confused on them  Accept coaching on managing the message but not massaging the message
Characterize: Consequence & Impact
 To the organization  To the shareholders  To the customers  To Society
Own: Your Accountability
 For asking the "high contrast" questions to expose the contours of risk  For delivering the message that needs to be heard  For the result ­ Both the impact of risks & the controls

What Are We Protecting?

US companies experience the most expensive data breach incidents caused by malicious or criminal attackers at $246 per compromised record1

32% say insider crimes are more damaging and costly than those perpetuated by outsiders2

The probability of a material data breach involving a minimum of 10,000 records is more than 22 percent3

Theft of trade secrets has cost US businesses $250 billion per year and are expected to double in the next decade4

How to Achieve Confidence?

Short-Term Actions
Know your Assets: Understand what you own or create, track your assets via inventory management and continuously assess risk relative to your assets life cycle
Know your People : Perform background check, assess/manage bad leaver risks and leverage your insider risk program to manage on-going risk with your people/contractors.
Be IR Ready: Select Incident Response ("IR") vendor(s) and contract an IR retainer/develop an IR plan
Validate Your Current Posture and Risk Profile: Conduct regular vulnerability and penetration tests

Longer-term actions
Know What You Do Not Know: Seek Cyber Resilience/triangulate what you think you know
Practice Your Offense and Defense: Simulate scenarios/stress-test solutions using third parties with expertise in advanced attacks and make sure you have the technologies, processes, and skill sets (internal and external) lined up in advance
Build Up Your Knowledge: Build a cross-disciplinary cyber response team/get access to the proper level of expertise
Know Your Vendors strengths and weaknesses
Ask for a Seat at the Boardroom Table
