Applying Depth in Defense
 Do you have continuous visibility into unknown or shadow assets?  Do you have continuous visibility into the security "state" of your assets?  Do you have critical context to prioritize threats and weaknesses?  Do you have critical context to measure security posture and assurance?  Are you able to take decisive actions to respond to attacks?  Are you able to take decisive actions to protect your assets?
