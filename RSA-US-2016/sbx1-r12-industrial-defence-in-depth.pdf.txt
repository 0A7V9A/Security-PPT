IS all INDUSTRIAL Infrastructure Critical?

#RSAC
Simplified ICS (OT) network schema

#RSAC
ICS Network: Common devices

HMI
Field equipment

SCADA server Data Historian
Development system (IDE) / Engineering WS
PLC/D CS

#RSAC
ICS Network: Common devices

#RSAC
Industrial Security Approach

Industrial Network

Corporate Network

1. Availability 2. Integrity 3. Confidentiality

1. Confidentiality 2. Integrity 3. Availability

Corporate IT Security is about Data protection Industrial Security is about Process protection Process should be continuous and only then secure

#RSAC
WHY NOT TO USE IT SOLUTIONS? (1)

Technologies
Antivirus
Patching Security testing and
audit

IT
Typical, highly automated
Typical, highly automated
Use of modern tools, external experts

ICS
Difficult, performance, FP, legacy systems
Difficult, Require switching to service
mode
Modern method and tools not applicable

#RSAC
WHY NOT TO USE IT SOLUTIONS? (2)

Technologies
Change management Incident management Equipment life cycle

IT
Typical
Event handling, recording is automated.
Post mortem and audit analysis is
common

ICS
Non-standard, Per case solutions
Difficulty replaying events
Not automated only when necessary

#RSAC
WHY NOT TO USE IT SOLUTIONS? (3)

Technologies
Physical security
Security development cycle
Compliance to standards

IT
Low security for offices, High for data
centers
Integrated into development cycle
Limited to some areas

ICS
Highly demanded Rare in use
Highly demanded

#RSAC
Industrial Security today -- Low awareness

C-level
Doesn't see how Cyber Security spending
relates to Revenues

IT Security
Is not allowed to go into Industrial sites

Engineers
Are more concerned about security measures
than malware

Mutual understanding and partnership between these 3 are crucial to successful cyber security and Critical Infrastructure Protection

#RSAC
What makes protection difficult today

Low awareness, mix of hype and real, no `hard data'

Typical `office' IT security is not applicable

Most attacks target the following objects: old, unsecure and hard to update

Lack of cyber security skills, and industrial cyber security practice

Lack of OT cyber security ownership

#RSAC
Industrial Specifics. Summary
Industrial Security is about Process protection Process should be continuous and only then secure IT vs OT The ICS network protocols do not have integrity check, user authorization and authentication Old or unsupported OS with no patching (Windows XP too) Specially designed approach, products & services

#RSAC
Cyber security is a process not a project

Support & update

Risk & threats awareness

Risk assessment

Implementation

Proposal & pilot

#RSAC
Cyber risks and threats
Mistakes by SCADA operators or contractors (3rd parties) Actions of Insiders (made on purpose or not) Incidental infection Infection via contractors (removable media or network connection) Lack of awareness and hard data for incident forensics Hacktivists actions and cyber hooligans attacks APTs and Governmental-backed attacks Cyber sabotage (any sort of it) Compliance Fraud

#RSAC
ATTACK VECTORS
Vulnerable software (SCADA, OS, 3rd-party) ERP/MES & Internet connections Uncontrolled software usage Unauthorized mobile device usage Uncontrolled external devices (USB, SATA, etc.) 3rd parties and contractors Supply chain Malware

Risks, Malware & Internet Treats

LEVEL 3 Manufacturing Operations management
LEVEL 2, 1 SCADA HMI Engineering Wks PLC, TRU etc
LEVEL 0 Physical

Malware via USB, Network, Corporate network, email, Web Human actions (intention or not) (insiders, contractors) Internet attacks (hackers, radicals, hacktivists, etc)
Malware via USB, Network, Contractors Human actions (insiders, contractors) Internet attacks
Malware via Industrial network Human actions
Human

#RSAC
Risk assessment (Security gap assessment)
Assessment Non-Invasive approach (based by traffic analysis) Interviews Agentless vulnerability / weakness scanning Pentests (on test facilities)
Cyber Threat Model Recommendations and step by step plan based on risks and specifics of a client

#RSAC
Cyber risks and threats

Malware & Attacks
Incidental infection Infection via contractors (removable media or network connection) Hacktivists actions and cyber hooligans attacks APTs & Governmental-backed attacks Cyber sabotage (any sort of it)
Human actions
Mistakes by SCADA operators or contractors (3rd parties) Actions of Insiders (made on purpose)
Compliance
Lack of awareness and hard data for incident forensics

Nodes Security Firewall/IDS Policy Education Protect, Prevent, Report & Remediate
Network Security Policy Education Detect, report

#RSAC
Defense strategies
Percentage of ICS-CERT FY 2014 and FY 2015 Incidents Potentially Mitigated by Each Strategy

#RSAC
Node Security
Protect & Prevent & Report & Remediate Works on ICS/SCADA Servers, engineering workstations and supports Human Machine Interfaces Run in high-availability mode & without updates Whitelisting is main technology External Device Control Vulnerability Assessments

#RSAC
Network Security
Detect & Report Network traffic anomaly detection in a passive mode Detection of potentially dangerous control commands from technological process point of view Network integrity monitoring (Detection of new network devices and communications in ICS network) Collect and store events -- Forensic, monitoring and incident detector tool
27

#RSAC
Firewall/IDS/Remote access
Protect & Prevent & Detect & Report Support industrial protocols Knows specific industrial attacks
28

#RSAC
Pilot testing
Pilot testing on test environment is an essential part Fine-tuning Customisation/for industry/ for customer / for product line Certification / vendors & regulators Approval by a client

#RSAC
Standards & best practices

#RSAC
Education
Cyber Security Awareness (should be part of induction process)
Employee cyber security training ICS Cyber Security basics Social attack in critical infrastructure environment
Cyber Security for SOC
Advanced cyber security trainings (malware analysis, reverse engineering etc.) on yearly basis

#RSAC
Incident response & Forensic
Common response and forensic services On-demand reports Customized reports on incidents/infections Early warnings on threats Private investigations (from malware analysis to complex service)
Own CERT Help with organizing it Training for staff Reports

#RSAC
Summary
Industrial Cyber Security is not like Office Cyber Security It requires specific approach, products and services Employees are the weakest link so education is extremely important Cyber security is not a project, it is a process
