Visa's Approach to Threat Intelligence
Glen Jones Head of Payment System Cyber Intelligence Visa

Visa Security Pillars

Remove sensitive data

Prevent fraud

Devalue Data

Protect Data

Render data useless for criminals, reducing incentive for payment breaches
· Tokenization
· EMV

Safeguard payment data
· Encryption · PCI

Harness Data
Identify fraud before it occurs and increase confidence in approving good transactions
· Risk-Based Authentication
· One-time Passcode
· Dynamic CVV2
· Breach Response

Empower Consumers
Engage cardholders as an underutilized resource in fighting fraud · Transaction
Alerts
· Spend Controls
· Geolocation

Transactional Threat Intelligence

Intelligence comes from recognizing fraud patterns, predicting fraud activity

Breach Detection Cycle

Cardholders report fraud to their bank
Banks report fraud to Visa (CPP)

Cardholder

Issuing Bank

Visa reports fraud to other banks

Breach found, stopped

One major limitation: What if there's no fraud?
Merchant Bank

An Improved Approach to Threat Intel
Combine cyber threat with transaction-based intelligence Goal is to identify the breach before the fraud ever begins We believe in actionable intelligence, but "actionable" is a buzzword Makes all the difference when we make the call (literally) on a suspected breach
"You're breached...now go find the needle in the haystack" vs.
"You're breached...and here's exactly what to look for..."

Case Study: Breached Retailer
Payment data breach at a large nationwide retail merchant Cards go up for sale on a dark market site A number of counterfeit transactions occur You didn't know there was fraud until your bill arrived Your bank didn't know until you told them Impact: breach went undetected for months

Case Study: Breached Restaurant
Point of Sale (POS) malware recovered from a retailer breach in early 2014, analyzed and indicators were extracted, including a hard-coded IP address Mandiant's malware analysis was distributed by Visa to a wide set of targeted merchants One of those merchants plugged IOCs into their Intrusion Detection System and immediately discovered a matching IP address Encrypted traffic to that IP for the last 12 weeks Traced it back to a credit switch in the merchant's processing environment Impact: Breach was detected, although no payment card data was ever sold, no fraud had occurred, none of the normal warning signs were present.

Evolving Payment System Crime
We expect attack techniques to evolve along with security
Intruders will use your own accounts and tools against you Highly customized, difficult to detect malware Stolen data combined in ways that perpetuate fraud
Fraudsters will get even more savvy with payment data monetization
Payment data will be sold in ways designed to thwart bank fraud detection (by ZIP code, for example) Mixing in old data to "water down" fraud detection They'll hold on to data for months or longer before selling on dark markets

Key Takeaways
Predictability of threat actors has changed, requiring the approach to change Prepare to be attacked Don't rely on one type of intelligence "Actionable" intel should trigger some sort of action Cybercriminals are cooperating, we need to do the same
