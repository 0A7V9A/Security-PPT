But this only happens

#RSAC

to less sophisticated companies, right?

BUSINESS FRAUD
On June 5, 2015, the Company determined that it had been the victim of a criminal fraud. The incident involved employee impersonation and fraudulent requests from an outside entity targeting the Company's finance department. This fraud resulted in transfers of funds aggregating $46.7 million held by a Company subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong to other overseas accounts held by third parties. As soon as the
Company became aware of this fraudulent activity it initiated contact with its Hong Kong subsidiary's bank and promptly initiated legal proceedings in various foreign jurisdictions. As a result of these efforts, the Company has recovered $8.1 million of the amounts transferred. Furthermore, an
additional $6.8 million of the amounts transferred are currently subject to legal injunction and reasonably expected to be recovered
by the Company in due course. The Company is continuing to pursue the recovery of the remaining $31.8 million and is cooperating with U.S. federal and numerous overseas law enforcement authorities who are actively pursuing a multi-agency criminal investigation. The Company may be limited in what information it can disclose due to the ongoing investigation. The ultimate amount of the loss will depend, in part, on the Company's success in recovering the funds. The Company may not be successful in obtaining any insurance coverage for this loss. The Company currently believes this is an isolated event and does not believe its technology systems have been compromised or that Company data has been exposed. While this matter will result in some additional near-term expenses, the Company does not expect this incident to have a material impact on its business or its ability to fund the anticipated working capital, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements of its ongoing operations.

#RSAC
So How Did I Get Exposed to this Scam?

#RSAC
February 12, 2014, 11:00 a.m.

CEO strolls into office at 11:00 a.m., walks by CFO office towards his office CFO looks up, sees CEO walking by, and says:
Tom the CEO

"Hey Tom, Jennifer [Corporate Controller] is working on that wire transfer you requested this morning."

Tim the CFO

"Huh? I did not request a wire transfer ..."

Tom the CEO
"Hmmmm ... let me look into what was sent to her"
8

Tim the CFO

#RSAC
The Email Our Controller Received at 9:58 a.m.
Email from CEO to CFO forwarded to Controller
9

#RSAC
With Attachment Going to Legit Bank
10

#RSAC
And When Controller Did Reply, Got Response
Note separation of duties
11

Accounting Was Scrutinizing the Wire Transfer

#RSAC

Request Independent of CEO/CFO Convo

Note doc requirements
12

But Given CEO/CFO Convo, We Looked a Bit

#RSAC

Closer at the Email Trail...and Voila!

And different fonts
13

An "l" was inserted into our domain name

#RSAC
So We Sprung Into Action
Thinking there was a targeted and sophisticated attack on us...
Bad guys created a look-a-like domain and created email accounts with our exec team members Figured out our org structure to send an email to our controller Was actively engaging with us via email Provided a legitimate sounding company name and a real bank (Citi) to send the money to
...we called the FBI while in parallel tried to track down who had centrilfy.com
14

#RSAC
Crooks Kept At It ...
While on hold with the FBI to report a crime, the criminal at same time would contact us asking for updates
15

#RSAC
And Contacted Us Once More
By then we had finally got in touch with FBI and they told us not to respond
16

In Parallel We Raced to Track Down Who Had

#RSAC

Created the Look-a-like Domain

Was created that same morning by someone using VistaPrint

17

We Then Experienced the Joys of Being

#RSAC

Put on Hold by VistaPrint for a Few Hours

Emails like this were sent ....
18

After a Few Hours Finally Were Finally

#RSAC

Able to Talk to Someone at VistaPrint

They killed the look-a-like domain

And were verbally told 60+ look-like-a-like domains had been created that morning
19

#RSAC
Prologue to this CEO Fraud Attempt
Reported to FBI but never heard back Similar scam attempts were publicly reported utilizing VistaPrint
PhishMe has good blog on VistaPrint

#RSAC
So Have the Scams Stopped?

#RSAC
No, Problem Getting Worse
Per my intro, growing 270%
Thieves continue to impersonate CEOs and CFOs and email people (e.g. controller, AP clerk, etc.) in the organization that can facilitate the wire transfer Will have very persuasive language and appeal to employee's desire to please the CEO/CFO
Use of authority: it is an order to do this Secrecy: The project is still secret and its success depends on this transaction Valorization: I count on you for your efficiency and discretion Pressure: The success of the project rests on your shoulders

22

#RSAC
And We Keep Getting Targeted
We probably get 1-2 a month now Some will have variations of "Centrify" domain But most emails are spoofs of someone sending an email from me or the CFO and if you were to reply would go to a different email account
23

#RSAC
Examples
Feb 4, 2015: An email from CEO to CFO asking for a wire transfer. Note the domain was "cenrtify.com," the "r" and "t" of "centrify" were flipped around.
24

#RSAC
Another Example
August 17, 2015: An email from CEO to CFO. If you were to reply, it would go to a charlyman2112 gmail account.
25

#RSAC
Trust Me, Everyone's Getting it Now
Even my Dad's 50-person leasing company in Michigan is getting this

#RSAC
Suggestions for Protecting Your Company Against this Scam

#RSAC
Key Takeaways
Immediately educate your accounting team, e.g. send entire finance department an article like
http://fortune.com/2015/10/13/ce o-wire-transfer-scam/ http://blog.centrify.com/ceo-fraudbusiness-email-compromise/
28

#RSAC
Key Takeaways
Sit down with your CFO and make sure that proper documentation and approvals are required for all money transfers, e.g.
Make sure that any wire transfer is associated and maps with an actual purchase inside the accounting system Determine if a separation of duties exist between initiator and approver of wire transfers For large wire transfers, request that G&A add a phone call to the approval process
29

#RSAC
Other Suggestions
Register any look-a-like domain names, e.g.
if you have a "i" in your domain name, buy the domain where a lower case "L" is swapped for the "i" if you have an "e" in your domain name buy the domain that has a "3" for an "e" etc.
Centrlify
30

#RSAC
Other Suggestions
Add multi-factor authentication to all key apps (including financial systems), so users can confirm they really are who they claim to be (e.g. when initiating a wire transfer)
31

#RSAC
Other Suggestions
Also layer on other identity controls such as privileged session monitoring for sensitive systems  this is in case the crooks have compromised the credentials of key employees in Finance.
32

#RSAC
Last Suggestion
Per the FBI "create intrusion detection system rules that flag e-mails with extensions that are similar to company e-mail. For example, legitimate e-mail of abc_company.com would flag fraudulent e-mail of abc-company.com"
abc_company.com abc-company.com

#RSAC
Summary
"CEO Fraud" is a big problem that is growing dramatically and is impacting all sizes of companies in all regions of the world Feeds off of culture of:
(a) CEO being able to get what they want with no questions asked and... (b) lack of checks and balances within accounting when it comes to wire transfers
34

#RSAC
Summary
Educating accounting teams is critically important Implementing MFA and privileged account management beyond IT personnel to your finance departments is also key
