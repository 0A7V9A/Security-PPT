IT Security Risks are Top of Mind

#RSAC

Greatest risks with emerging, disruptive technologies

This is a marked change from just two years ago, when security concerns made just a blip on their radar screens.

Disruptive technologies where IT Security risk was selected as #1 Top Concern
· Mobile solutions · Cloud computing · Smart, connected (IoT) · Cognitive computing · Advanced manufacturing technologies · Man-machine hybrids

IBM 2015 C-Suite Study: Source: Q1.4 Which of the following technologies will revolutionize your business in 3 to 5 years? [Rank up to 3]
cut by Q2.3 Which of the following risks do you think may occur in 3 to 5 years as a result of the technology you ranked #1 in question 1.4?
Rake-weighted n=5247

Fear of the new

#RSAC
The latest "technologies du jour" such as mobile are capturing more Executive level attention, despite the fact that there are, currently, fewer known incidents through these channels than others (e.g. legacy applications, vendor/partner system integration points, network security). Admittedly, legacy infrastructure vulnerabilities remain a top of concern for all. They are exacerbated by emerging technologies (e.g. API Security).

Methodology to cluster effectiveness
3 Strategic components:
Q10.1 Evaluating potential security issues across all initiatives (C-Suite collaboration) Q10.2 Indentifying critical enterprise data (the Crown Jewels) Q10.3 Developing an effective response plan in the event of a breach (internal & external)
4 Tactical components:
Q13.1 Prevention: Having necessary prevention practices and tools in place Q 13.2 Detection: Deploying continuous monitoring & detection tools Q13.3 Response: Implementing a comprehensive response plan Q13.4 Remediation: Implementing remediation plans to strengthen security
We asked respondents how they have prepared strategically and tactically along these factors and used responses to these questions to see if clusters emerged, by capability.

Statement of Good Security Practices: IT system security involves protecting systems and information through prevention, detection and response to improper access from within and outside your enterprise. Improper access can result in information being altered, destroyed, misappropriated or misused or can result in damage to or misuse of your systems, including for use in attacks on others. No IT system or product should be considered completely secure and no single product, service or security measure can be completely effective in preventing improper use or access. IBM systems, products and services are designed to be part of a lawful, comprehensive security approach, which will necessarily involve additional operational procedures, and may require other systems, products or services to be most effective. IBM DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE IMMUNE FROM, OR WILL MAKE YOUR ENTERPRISE IMMUNE FROM, THE MALICIOUS OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY PARTY.
