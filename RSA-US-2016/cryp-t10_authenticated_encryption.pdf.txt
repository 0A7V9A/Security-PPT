INT-RUP Security and rate of Block Cipher based AE

INT-RUP Security of AE Construction (Andreeva et.al.) Adversary is given both Encryption, Decryption and Verification oracle. Decryption Query: (Ni , Di , Ci )  Mi (no Ti in the query) Advint-rup(A) = |Pr [K R K : AEK ,DK ,VK =]| Used for low-end devices with limited buffer.
Rate of a Construction Messages blocks processed per block-cipher call. Rate-1 means efficient construction.
