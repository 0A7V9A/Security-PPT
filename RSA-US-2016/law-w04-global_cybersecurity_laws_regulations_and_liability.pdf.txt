#RSAC
Introduction
 Why governance of cyberspace is different and hard ­ and fascinating!
· Cyberspace's reach across geo-political boundaries defies traditional governance.
· Who has authority to make the law? · What is the applicable law? · Who has the power to enforce it?
· Co-dependency of public and private sectors: gov't duty, but mostly private assets · Different sets of rules to protect systems and data types
· Critical Infrastructure · Proprietary Information · Personal Data
· Challenges of anonymity and attribution

#RSAC
Council of Europe ­ Cybercrime Convention
No single international framework for cybersecurity law, but some multi-lateral efforts Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (2001)
· Council of Europe's effort to harmonize disparate national cybercrime laws. · Signatories promise to:
· Adopt domestic legislation to establish procedures outlined in treaty (e.g., expedited preservation, search and seizure, interception of computer data).
· Cooperate through mutual legal assistance (MLA) even if no more specific agreement (e.g., extradition, accessing computer data, interception).
· Prosecute cyber crimes committed on its territory

#RSAC
EU ­ Cybersecurity Framework
EU Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive
· In January 2016, EU Parliament approved NIS Directive, proposed in 2013 EU Cyber Security Strategy. Expect formal approval by Council of Ministers, then EU countries must implement into national law within 21 months.
PRIVACY ­ Proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation
· Extraterritorial Application and Enforcement. New law would apply to any company that controls or processes the personal data of Europeans through the offering of goods and services ­ even if company has no physical presence in Europe.
· Fines of up to 4% of company's annual global revenue or 20 million for violations

#RSAC
United States Cybersecurity Law
Cybersecurity legal parameters arise from multiple layers and sources.
· Federal law · Computer Fraud and Abuse Act prohibits unauthorized computer access, interference, obtaining data · Electronic Communications Privacy Act governs interception, access to data
· State law -- fills gaps in federal law, but can set de facto national standards · Example: Massachusetts data breach requirement triggered by a (1) substantial risk of identity theft or fraud (2) OR acquisition or use for an unauthorized purpose
 Companies handling sensitive personal data must have Written Information Security Policy; encryption of personal data transmitted externally; and specific minimum "administrative, technical, and physical" security controls.

regulated entities
· February 2014: NIST releases Cybersecurity Framework and CI Cyber Community ("C³")

#RSAC
Analysis: Tensions in Global Cyberspace
The rapid growth of the Internet and sophistication of cybercrime continues to outpace the ability of the legal system to respond. The attribution problem makes policing and accountability particularly difficult. Cyber assets are distributed between the public sector and private sector, and the private sector is comprised of a wide range of disparate entities. There is a lack of international coordination on cyber issues. As a result, there is no centralized international cyber threat information sharing or common computer incident response teams. Different values among countries; different levels of preparedness; different degrees of interest and risks. Companies and governments face overlapping and conflicting sets of laws: · Harmonization vs. divergence of regional and national laws · Personal data laws and system/infrastructure obligations are not integrated or reconciled Quality of company's cybersecurity depends in part on visibility into traffic on its own network, but such insight can be in tension with cultural and sometimes legal barriers to electronic monitoring of employees. Approach to implementation: market-driven vs. regulatory Governance: government-centric vs. multi-stakeholder

#RSAC
Analysis: Regionalism in Law and Policy
Prominence of regionalism reflected in emergence of international and regional cybersecurity instruments Instruments developed in the context of, or inspired by:
· Council of Europe or the European Union · Commonwealth of Independent States or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization · intergovernmental African organizations · League of Arab States · United Nations
Substantial cross-fertilization exists among all instruments
· Example: concepts in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime by Council of Europe.
Trend: regional and national incorporation of treaty-based cybersecurity legal regimes

Applying What You've Learned
Next week, you should: · Meet your cyber lawyer; begin talking about legal aspects of managing cyber risks · Begin identifying and mapping regional, national, and sub-national cyber legal rules, wherever you do business In the next 6 months, you should: · Conduct a cyber legal assessment to determine vulnerabilities, risks, and resources · Develop, update, and maintain written policies and procedures, including on governance by Board of Directors. · Identify the cybersecurity tools and services used by your company; learn how they work and handle data; and then
analyze them against current law in each jurisdiction where your company uses them. Before next year's RSA conference, you should: · Develop and maintain cybersecurity training programs for employees and contractors · Deploy information security safeguards for vendors/service providers, including reporting and due diligence · Regularly test and update all assessments, safeguards, and protocols
