Espionage

Role of Government How can we sustain the momentum of the Obama cyber initiative into the next Administration? How can the USG sustain the promotion of norms? Will there be more indictments of malicious actors?
Is the Economic Espionage Act sufficient? Uniform Trade Secrets Act Computer Fraud and Abuse Act The Tariff Act of 1930 How are we implementing the Cybersecurity Act of 2015? Is Information Sharing improving? Post OPM/DHS/FBI can the USG improve its own security? Will the Obama cyber initiative last past the end of his presidency?
