The dark web...

Where is it?

#RSAC
Not accessible via traditional browsers
Exists somewhere amongst the Surface and Deep webs
For most people it is the stuff of legend; like monsters under the bed

#RSAC
Oh what a wicked web we weave...or is it?
For some, it is a vehicle and means to an end for illicit activity
For others, it is a vital tool in their arsenal to ensure privacy and anonymity
Global privacy and anonymity issues will ensure it continues to grow

#RSAC
Dangerous but worth the risk
Complexity is worth the value provided
Why?

#RSAC
And so the dance begins...

#RSAC
But not all is as it seems...

Take aways
The Dark Web is not going away anytime soon; its popularity is growing
We can embrace it or we can ignore it at our own risk
Become familiar with it; its content, services, and denizens
Use this knowledge to ensure that the noble reasons for its use continue while the illicit diminish

Where do we come from?
Obviously, all countries pushed to develop their capabilities.
According to their capabilities, we can make 3 categories.

What happens when you get public?
Public level: Public scrutiny´s power depends on democracy´s health. May affect legislation and future capabilities.
Operational level:
Operation burst ­ but maybe amortized Operational changes and continue as usual Do nothing
Diplomatic level: Obvious consequences
