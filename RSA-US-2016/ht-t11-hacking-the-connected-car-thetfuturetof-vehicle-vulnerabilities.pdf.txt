Topics that will be addressed today
 Examples of high-profile hacks and the variance in techniques (remote access, physical access and through supporting mobile phone software)
 A high-level analysis of Kelley Blue Book research to illustrate vehicle hacking vulnerabilities and consumer perceptions
 A future-casting of how in-car technology will evolve over the next 10 years with a focus on the potential to hack multiple devices (mobile phones, wearables, etc.) by hacking a car, or vice versa
 Mitigating risk by providing incentives for security researchers to share their vulnerability findings

#RSAC
Hacking is becoming a bigger issue, period

#RSAC
There were several high-profile hacks in 2015

Anthem "

says hack may affect

more than 8.8 million other BCBS members"

"One of the biggest
security firms in the world
admits it was hacked"

"Ashley Madison

hack is not only real, it's worse than we thought"

"Hack brief: Hackers steal 15M T-Mobile customers' data from
Experian"

OPM "

hack: Government finally

starts notifying 21.5 Million victims"

There are more vehicle hacking entry points

#RSAC

than ever before

"FCA issues Uconnect
software update amid hacking fears"

"OnStar hack remotely starts
cars, GM working on a fix"

"Hacker uses smartphone to hack a
connected car"

"Two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into
the car's entertainment system"

"Hackers cut a Corvette's brakes
via a common car gadget"

#RSAC

#RSAC
So where are we currently and what's next?

#RSAC
Current and future landscape...
Current
 Average car on the road is over 11 years old, so most cars currently remain unconnected
 "Dumb" cars can, however, become connected as a result of aftermarket additions
 To our knowledge, no vehicle hacks have occurred in a non-controlled environment
 Most autonomous features are driver-assist vs. fully autonomous  While the financial gains for hacking remain unclear at this point, the
potential exists in the future (through ransomware, etc.)  Adversarial gains are possible

The future landscape ­ everything is

#RSAC

connected!

Future
Volkswagen BUDD-e ­ Mobile device on wheels
Internet of Things connections to home, phone, work and infrastructure
Potential to become a new form of cyberterrorism
Difficult for consumers to know if a car has been hacked (if they're not paying attention)

#RSAC
Next Steps

#RSAC
Applied ­ How to get ahead of this issue
 Consumers' vigilance whenever connected with any device, including phone, IoT devices and car
 We are all assuming a certain level of risk for convenience  Automakers should (if they haven't already):
 Develop research teams  Crowd source vulnerabilities & collect information on every hack
 Government only now focusing on this issue
 The process to create a standard is slow, however basic standards do need to be established similar to existing standards for crash tests, fuel efficiency, etc.
 The tech industry and automakers need to work together instead of viewing each other as competitors in regards to connected vehicles

What manufacturers and organizations are

#RSAC

doing NOW to mitigate risks

 Tesla ­ cash for those who find vulnerabilities
 NHTSA ­ partnering with automotive and research firms to understand more about exploits, etc.
 Auto ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center) ­ created by automobile OEMs as a central hub for intelligence analysis
 Hackathons such as Battelle-SAE CyberAuto Challenge, Black Hat, etc.
