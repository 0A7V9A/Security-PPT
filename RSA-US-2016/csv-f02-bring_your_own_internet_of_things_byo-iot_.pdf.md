Internet of Things ­ Definition

#RSAC

(Techopedia.com)

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing concept that describes a future where everyday physical objects will be connected to the Internet and be able to identify themselves to other devices. The term is closely identified with RFID as the method of communication, although it also may include other sensor technologies, wireless technologies or QR codes.
The IoT is significant because an object that can represent itself digitally becomes something greater than the object by itself. No longer does the object relate just to you, but is now connected to surrounding objects and database data. When many objects act in unison, they are known as having "ambient intelligence.""
"The Internet of Things is a difficult concept to define precisely."

Internet of Things ­ So, What Is it?

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Definition (Conclusion)
1. Needs to be networked / connected 2. Some capability of sensing and decision making without human
interaction/control
Many products have the word "Smart" in their name or to describe its function

Internet of Things ­ Why Should You Care?
The analyst firm Gartner says that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion connected devices... that's a lot of connections (some even estimate this number to be much higher, over 100 billion).
"We expect the number of connected objects to reach 50bn by 2020 (2.7% of things in the world)" - Cisco

What's The Attack Surface?

#RSAC
Internet of Things - Communication

Cloud / SaaS

Internal Network

Mobile App

Other Devices

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Devices (ASA)
Remotely accessible services with proper authentication / authorization?
Secured communication with other devices, clients, cloud?
Secure firmware updating?

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ It's Not Just WiFi
During a wireless assessment of a client's WiFi network, InGuardians sniffed for ZigBee, Z-wave, and other 900 MHz
traffic common for IoT devices
It was found that the building contained a ZigBee network that the client was not aware of
This network supported devices controlling the building's HVAC system, which put the company's manufacturing process at risk

Servers securely configured? Mature patch strategy e.g. using VI solution? Secure storage of data? Redundancy and do devices work if no connectivity to cloud?

Internet of Things ­ IoT Vulns So Far?

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ State of Security
Why so relatively few critical vulnerabilies?
Requires physical access to devices and often extracting firmware from them, as
it's not otherwise readily available

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ State of Security
Since there still isn't much IoT vulnerability information (yet!) are there lessons learned from regular
embedded devices?

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Mobile Apps

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ State of Security
Devices are likely affected by many basic vulnerabilities (low code maturity)
Mobile apps may not perform proper TLS certificate validation or store data securely
If this is the state of their devices and apps, how much do you trust their cloud with your data?

Where To Start At Your Org?

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Security Needs A Seat!

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Find Your IoT!
Get an inventory of your current IoT devices
Network scanning / mapping - know what software is in use where including IoT devices Look at outgoing web traffic / logs to see what IoT devices are talking outbound
Know where risk is in your environment
Map and track in existing asset management data / CMDBs Ensure you have proper vulnerability intelligence

Internet of Things ­

#RSAC

Don't Only Rely On Vuln Scanning

Most organizations ONLY use scanners for managing vulnerabilities

Many scanners do not even include IoT checks in their products! Even if they did they can't find some of the issues!
Even if they did, it is a much longer Time of Exposure than if you truly know your environment (assets) and map to known vulnerabilities
Use scanners as a catch all and to help uncover configuration issues, but know IoT isn't a focus yet!

Internet of Things ­

#RSAC

Basic Security Foundation!

Implement proper network segmentation for all IoT devices where possible

Allows for reduction of attack surface

Improves incident response ability when devices are clearly indentified

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ IoT Vendors
Accept devices are going to be connected to the Internet and can be easily accessed Plan for this and ensure the proper security is in build into the product
Ensure software / firmware can be updated and actually update it! Do NOT allow "forever day" bugs! Plan for updates, limit the use of embedded components where possible Create an easy to use auto-update features available
Educate staff on security issues Train developers on secure development Create a process and figure out how to respond when issues are found/reported Create an Incident Response team and disclosure vulnerabilities

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ IoT Vendors
Implement proper logging and audit history for access and usage
Implement access control for the device, including two factor authentication options.
Perform source code security audits and product penetration tests Consider creating a bug bounty program to reward reported vulnerabilities in products
Understand the 3rd party libraries and code used in the product Select secure libraries from the beginning Monitor for 3rd party vulns and correct.

#RSAC
Internet of Things ­ Actions
1. Start talking with your executives about the issues and ensure you are in the loop to conduct the proper risk assessments.
2. IoT is already in your network and more is coming very soon! Inventory current IoT and ensure ongoing monitoring
3. Ensure you incorporate your incident response program to include IoT products and vendors.
4. Work with vendors and pick products that demonstrate they care about security!
