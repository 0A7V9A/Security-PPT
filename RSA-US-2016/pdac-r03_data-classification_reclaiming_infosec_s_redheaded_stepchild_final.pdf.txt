Reclaiming Infosec's Redheaded Stepchild

#RSAC
Why was classification neglected until now?

#RSAC
· Does your organization have data classification policies?
· What percentage of your data is being classified?

#RSAC
The sad reality...

55%
of IT professionals say data classification is too complex to plan, manage and deploy

63%
of IT professionals are not certain that their company's classification scheme is aligned with how data is created, used and shared

88%
of IT professionals say they ignored or circumvented data classification policies

* Based on a survey of 100 IT professionals conducted by Secure Islands, Nov. 2015

#RSAC
Why is classification so critical ... Now more than ever

#RSAC
Information security starts with
CLASSIFICATION

#RSAC
The CISO dilemma...
"I cannot start my <fill in the blank> project before I know how to identify my (sensitive) data..."
A) IRM B) DLP C) Access controls D) Mail encryption E) Moving to the Cloud F) Data retention G) All of the above

#RSAC
What is an effective data classification model?

Unstructured / structured

Automatic by system /
manually by user

Embedded in the data / referenced to external source

#RSAC
It's not "We Should"... It's "We Can"!

#RSAC
The 4 basic steps for implementing data classification

Define what to classify

Decide in which stage to classify

Select the method of classification
(manual/automatic)

Define and apply the data class labels

#RSAC
Step 1: Define what to classify

Define what to classify

Decide in which stage to classify

Select the method of classification
(manual/automatic)

Define and apply the data class labels

#RSAC
Deciding what to classify
Not all data was created equal!
· Don't try to classify all your data · Concentrate on your high business impact first · Remember that this is an ongoing, iterative process

#RSAC
Step 2: Decide in which stage to classify

Define what to classify

Decide in which stage to classify

Select the method of classification
(manual/automatic)

Define and apply the data class labels

#RSAC
In which stage to classify?

#RSAC
In which stage to classify?

#RSAC
Classify as close to the source as possible
The first step in identifying sensitive data is to examine its source at creation

Classification based
on the context of the source results
in accuracy

The data owner is
accountable

Starting at birth
allows to apply protection as early in the lifecycle as possible and covers
the entire info lifecycle

#RSAC
How to accomplish this step?

From your high business impact data:

Identify sources
· Applications · File servers · Databases · Repositories

Valuable info can be deduced from other initiatives like:
· Audit reviews · Risk analysis reports · Etc.

#RSAC
Step 3: Select the method of classification

Define what to classify

Decide in which stage to classify

Select the method of classification
(manual/automatic)

Define and apply the data class labels

#RSAC
What method to use?
The aspiration -> Minimize the friction with the end user

#RSAC
Minimizing friction with the user

#RSAC
Methods of Information Classification
User driven classification
May classify a document in an accurate way when working on it Classification may not be predicted across the org (it is manual process after all) Users forget to classify and may object to the process Users' frustration and lack of effectiveness over time

#RSAC

#RSAC
Methods of Information Classification

User driven classification

Source based automatic classification

Classification at the source ­ where information is created Classify data created by any source at the business 100% accurate. Always Predictive Requires pre-data mapping -> admin should define policies/rules

#RSAC
Methods of information classification
New concept:
"Crowdsourcing Classification"
Automatic classification
User driven classification

#RSAC
Crowdsourcing-based classification

AUTOMATIC POLICIES

CROWD GENERATED

#RSAC
How does it work?

1
User classifies a document/file manually

USER CONTENT CONTEXT RESULT

2
The system based on Machine Learning engine learns the classification env. (content, context, and classification)

3
Additional users classify similar data in similar way

USER CONTENT CONTEXT RESULT

4
Generate automatic Classification for this data type

#RSAC
Step 4: Define and apply the data class labels

Define what to classify

Decide in which stage to classify

Select the method of classification
(manual/automatic)

Define and apply the data class labels

#RSAC
Which data-class labels to apply?

Data classes should convey the protection goals

Labels should be meaningful and self explanatory

Minimize use of multi dimensional labels (e.g. confidential, HR, US)

* For "DLP" use-cases, sensitivity levels is enough (public, internal, confidential, secret) For SoD/Internal compartmentalization, multi dimensional labels should be needed

#RSAC
Define the required classification labels

· What is the minimal set of Classification labels necessary to convey the protection? · Distinguish between different types of Classification records: · List the levels according to the order of their sensitivity · Consider one record for each protection policy

· In most cases it is possible, and recommended, to use only sensitivity levels labels!

Sensitivity Levels: Public Internal Confidential Secret

Classification Subjects: HR Info CID Info Finance Info Others?

Classification Flags: Cross Border Country Segregated External Comm. Waiver?

#RSAC
Define the required protection policy
What classification labels are required to support your protection needs?
· Build a Classification matrix with suitable protection policies

Some tips for effective information classification

#RSAC
Tips for effective information classification
1. Choose a solution that allows both manual AND automatic classification
2. Make sure to choose a solution that covers all data sources (including LoB apps) and is not focused on MS-Office alone
3. Use a classification scheme that leverages and enhances existing tools such as DLP, archiving, e-discovery and more
4. Use persistent labelling that follows the data wherever it goes and throughout its entire lifecycle (be platform agnostic)

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
Identify your high business impact data within your organization
In the first 3 months following this presentation you should:
Understand from what sources this data is being generated/accessed Define a classification scheme which correlates your protection policies Review classification systems (also inquiry analyst firms in this field)
Within 6 months you should:
PoC-ing/pilot-ing a security system which can "intercept" different sources with minimum friction with the end user
