#RSAC
The Shifting IT Environment
(...or why security has become so important)

#RSAC
Shift: Compliance and Consequences
The business has to adhere to regulations, guidelines, standards,...
SAS 112 and SOX (U.S.) ­ upped the ante on financial audits (and supporting IT systems) PCI DSS ­ requirements on companies that process payment cards HIPAA, GLBA, BASEL II, ..., many more
Audits have changed the economics of risk and create an "impending event"
Hackers may attack you but auditors will show up
Disclosure laws mean that the consequences of failure have increased
Waves of disclosure legislation

#RSAC
Shift: Technology
· Many applications/transactions now operate over the web · Cloud is changing our notion of a perimeter · Worker mobility is redefining the IT landscape · Shadow IT is becoming enterprise IT · Majority of web transactions are now encrypted (SSL) · The security model has changed from good people vs. bad people
to enabling partial trust
­ There are more "levels" of access: Extranets, partner access, customer access, identity management, ...

#RSAC
Shift: Attackers
 Cyber criminals are becoming organized and profit-driven
 An entire underground economy exists to support cybercrime
 Attackers are shifting their methods to exploit both technical and human weaknesses
 Attackers after much more than traditional monetizable data (PII, etc.)
 Hacktivism  State-sponsored attacks  IP attacks/breaches

#RSAC
Shift: Customer expectations
Customers, especially businesses, are using security as a discriminator
In many ways security has become a non-negotiable expectation of businesses
Security being woven into service level agreements (SLAs)
The "average person" is now familiar with security

#RSAC
Big Questions
How do you communicate the value of security to the enterprise (and management)? How do you measure security? How do you rank risks? How do you reconcile security and compliance? How can you be proactive and not reactive? What is "security intelligence" and how would you actually consume, act on or share it? What changes are likely in privacy laws, data sovereignty, trust? What about big issues in the news like breaches of very personal data that cannot be reset or revoked? How should/can we adapt what we do based on them? How do you adapt to new paradigms like IoT?

#RSAC
The Economics of Security

#RSAC
Hackernomics (noun)
A social science concerned chiefly with description and analysis of attacker motivations, economics, and business risk. Characterized by
5 fundamental immutable laws and 4 corollaries

#RSAC
Law 1
Most attackers aren't evil or insane; they just want something
Corollary 1.a.: We don't have the budget to protect against evil people but we can protect
against people that will look for weaker targets

#RSAC
Law 2
Security isn't about security. It's about mitigating risk at some cost.
Corollary 2.a.: In the absence of metrics, we tend to over focus on risks that are either
familiar or recent.

#RSAC
Law 3
Most costly breaches come from simple failures, not from attacker ingenuity
Corollary 3.a.: Bad guys can, however, be VERY creative if properly incentivized.

#RSAC
The CAPTCHA Dilemma
Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart

#RSAC
Law 4
In the absence of security education or experience, people (employees, users, customers, ...) naturally make poor security decisions with technology
Corollary 4.a.: Systems needs to be easy to use securely and difficult to use insecurely

#RSAC

#RSAC
Law 5
Attackers usually don't get in by cracking some impenetrable security control, they look for weak points like trusting employees
