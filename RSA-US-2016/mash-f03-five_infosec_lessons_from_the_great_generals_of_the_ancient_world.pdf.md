Thermopylae: The Bottleneck

"The Persians were roughly handled by the Spartans, since they used shorter spears than the Greeks and could not use their numbers fighting in a narrow space. The Spartans fought memorably, showing themselves skilled fighters amidst unskilled."
-Herodotus, Histories (VII, 211)

Oblique Formation: Leuctra, 371BC

"The Spartans led each half-company three files abreast, and this resulted in the phalanx being not more than twelve men deep. The Thebans, however, were massed not less than fifty shields deep, calculating that if they conquered that part of the army around the king, all the rest of it would be easy to overcome."
- Xenophon, Hellenica
