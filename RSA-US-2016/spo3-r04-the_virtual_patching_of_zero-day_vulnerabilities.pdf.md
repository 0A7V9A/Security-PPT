Disclosure deadlines ­ a hot topic

Disclosure deadlines at Trend Micro
Upon discovery of a possible vulnerability Trend Micro will seek to contact the affected vendors through email, social media (privately) or telephone, whichever is applicable. We will inform them about the nature of the vulnerability, our assessment of how critical the vulnerability is, and how soon we would be expecting their reply.
We will then give the affected vendor up to 48 hours to give us a non-automated reply. If the vendor replies within 48 hours, we will next coordinate with the vendor for an acceptable time frame for a security update. The acceptable time frame lies mostly on the complexity of the vulnerability, but in general, will not exceed 12 weeks from the time of the report.

Disclosure deadlines at Trend Micro
The above guidelines are applicable for most vulnerability findings. The only exceptional treatment of a vulnerability is if a vulnerability is under active attack by an in-the-wild exploit (i.e. 0-day). In this case, in the interest of the safety and security of the general public, Trend Micro will disclose zero-day exploit information within the next 24 hours of vulnerability discovery. We will, however, make sure to inform the vendor that we are reporting about the vulnerability within the next 24 hours, and any action they will be undertaking to address the issue will be taken into account in the publication including any Trend Micro solutions to protect our customers. We will not be disclosing the full vulnerability information but enough technical details to allow IT admins to determine the appropriate workarounds in the case of unavailability of a timely patch.

One Example ­ Java Zero Day discovery

One Example ­ Java Zero Day
1. July 11 ­ Vulnerability Research team discovered the Java zero-day, and linked it to Pawn Storm 2. July 14 ­ Oracle released an advisory and patched the vulnerability 3. July 14 ­ We published FTR's detailed findings of the APT attack chain
July 15th, our researchers and InfoSec found that the infection URL as discussed in #3 (contained in spear phishing emails and hosting the zero-day exploit) has been modified so that it redirects traffic to http://trendmicro.eu.
InfoSec has confirmed that there is no compromise on our infrastructure, and InfoSec had these notes on why the attackers will redirect traffic to us:
- In retaliation on Trend disclosing their recent campaign - By pointing to our host it may mislead other system owners to associate our IP
216.104.20.189 to the attack, and may mistakenly block our IP - Other researchers tracing this campaign may also be misled into thinking our systems are
compromised and mis-used by this actors

Apply what you have learned today
Accept that you always will be behind with patching Don't use this as an excuse not to do proper patch management! Buy time to patch with Virtual Patching Apply this to all your systems ­ your cloud systems are vulnerable too! Don't treat all incidents the same ­ focus on the important ones Listen and learn from the attacks; when they use sophisticated weapons, you are a prime target!

Always remember
A sophisticated attacker is focused and persistent!
