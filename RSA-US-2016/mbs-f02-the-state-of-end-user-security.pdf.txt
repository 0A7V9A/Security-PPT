Goal of this talk
Everybody talks mobile, but do we really know what's out there? What is hype, what is myth? Provide detailed data that will help you
To differentiate theoretical attacks from reality Understand the risk surface you are facing
Enable you to make more informed decisions for your mobile strategy

Digital Identity Network
Consists mainly of Financial Services, Online Retailers and Social Media sites Main use cases are account logins (76%), payments (21%) and account creations (3%) Global data from every single country
In short: It is representative data

#RSAC
Mobile traffic is different
Traditional security measures don't work as well as they did in the
past
14

Most high risk transactions are still from the

#RSAC

non-mobile channel

15

Browser spoofing is one of the most common

#RSAC

"attacks"

16

Browser spoofing is significantly higher on

#RSAC

mobile than on non-mobile

17

#RSAC
Detailed statistics

#RSAC
Mobile and Non-mobile OS is converging
Data is for all transactions, not just mobile transactions
19

#RSAC
iOS is leading the charge
20

Reversed picture if we look at the high risk

#RSAC

transactions

21

#RSAC
Jailbroken devices
22

#RSAC
Jailbreak detection methods
Most common identifier for Jailbreak
file:///private/var/lib/cydia file:///private/var/stash file:///private/var/lib/apt
Beware though
You would miss 65% of jailbroken detections if you "just" focus on these
23

#RSAC
How are people connecting?
24

#RSAC
Location is important
On a native mobile device, location can be obtained in many ways
GPS IP (True IP, DNS IP, ...) Signal strength
25

#RSAC
How accurate is the IP Address Location?
Connection type: Cellular
26

#RSAC
How accurate is the IP Address Location?
Connection type: Wifi
27

#RSAC
IP Address Anomalies

Interesting anomalies can be found by interrogating the IP address of the device and comparing it to the IP address of its used DNS server

IP Geo Russia Ukraine USA USA ...

DNS IP Geo USA USA Russia Iran, Islamic Republic of ...

28

#RSAC
Other anomalies (Xposed)
Still on a very low level (< 0.1%), but growing
29

#RSAC
Device Encryption
Android only
30

Surprisingly, mobile app transactions represent

#RSAC

more high risk transactions

31

#RSAC
Myths / Assumptions

#RSAC
Operating systems are converging
Windows 10 Mac OS/X ­ iOS Android ­ Chrome
When is an OS a mobile OS?
33

#RSAC
Different OS's have different attack surface
No surprise
Ecosystem
Mobile Ecosystem is much more diverse
34

#RSAC
Jailbreaking
Jailbroken devices are not as commonly used on a global scale But they do represent a significantly higher risk if they are being used
35

#RSAC
OS anomalies
There are plenty of anomalies with mobile traffic that is there for the taking Browser-string vs TCP fingerprint
36

#RSAC
Take advantage of additional information from mobile devices

#RSAC
Mobile Location
IP Address Location DNS IP Address Location Hardware / GPS Location Carrier Location
38

#RSAC
Huge amount of forensics information available
Jailbreak detection Root Cloaking detection OS anomalies Mobile App Integrity Mobile App Reputation

Conclusion

#RSAC
Mobile is part of the omni-channel


#RSAC
Rich data + advanced models = win
