How Can You Think Like an Operative?
Assume there is always a loophole Don't use same image on public sites that you use on hidden sites Educate yourself and company on threats Be aware that what you read isn't always true Understand technical attacks Work together as a team

How is this Relevant?
We consume software
Software is written for functionality, NOT security Unknown vulnerabilities Hacks are ultimately against software

CVE 13 7 16 12 32 35

#RSAC
Next Problem....
Products tested & analyzed for vulnerabilities Products consist of Components
Components are not visible Vulnerabilities may not be visible at test time
2014, CVE spike was because of products with OpenSSL

#RSAC
Problem With Components

#RSAC
Proposed Solutions
Government Approach Technical Approach

#RSAC
Technical Approach: Identify Software
National Software Reference Library
http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/Downloads.htm SHA1, MD5, and SHA256
Online Queries
Nsrlsvr (http://rjhansen.github.io/nsrlsvr/) Nsrllookup (http://rjhansen.github.io/nsrllookup/)

#RSAC
Technical Approach: Product Analysis
Identify components in products
Copyright / Trademark / Version information 3rd party license files Hashes
Assuming all components are identified
Name, Origin, Version Can associate to product

#RSAC
Need Tools
To Identify software, and associated components, in your environment Then the tool can
cross reference software to vulnerability in databases raise awareness provide sufficient information to enable you to test the PSV

Caution
Not every Vulnerability will be meaningful
Every CVE would be marked as
Relevant, Not Relevant, Investigation Mitigated, Not Mitigated, No mitigation needed

#RSAC
Re-Cap Applying This Today
Look at resources in this presentation Create a tool that:
Identifies components in software Checks against CVE Enables triage & communication of potential issues
Spread the word & ...
