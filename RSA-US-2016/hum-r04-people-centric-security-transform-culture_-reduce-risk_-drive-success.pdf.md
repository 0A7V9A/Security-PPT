What is Security Culture?

Corporate Culture and Performance (Kotter & Heskett)
Research (and anecdotal) evidence that culture impacts organizational performance

"Good" Culture
Revenue +682% Workforce +282% Stock +901% Income +756%

Revenue +166% Workforce +36% Stock +74% Income +1%
"Bad" Culture

Security Culture and Security Risk

Culture is about values and priorities (assumed and unspoken, "invisible")

Security risk increases when different values, priorities, and cultures compete for scarce resources

"I have 3 goals to accomplish, and the time and resources to complete 2..."

Security often loses out to the competition (efficiency, usability, profit)

The Competing Security Cultures Framework

Think of the CSCF as a personality test for your security program...
Is your program a control freak? A conformist? A cowboy? A community builder?
How do different personalities get along?

From People-Centric Security by Dr. Lance Hayden

Measuring and Mapping Security Cultures

A measurement instrument (Security Culture Diagnostic Survey) provides data allowing visual mapping of a security culture
Priorities, biases, and competing priorities become visualized

SCDS available from lhayden.net/culture

Measuring and Mapping Security Cultures

Granular SCDS response visualization

Allows for more intuitive cultural "shapes"

Which become comparative cultural "maps" showing potential conflicts and cultural risks

How to Transform Your Own Security Culture

Evaluating & Improving Security Culture
You have to know where you are before you can get where you want to go Cultural maturity is about optimizing organizational selfawareness If culture was easy enough to change with an awareness campaign, every company would

be innovative, fun, and secure
27

Culture as an Organizational Capability
Culture is a capability Maturity is about measurement How do you know culture is changing? How do you know when it needs changing? How do you prove it?
28

Mapping out a Transformation Plan
Observe the terrain Orient the map Take a bearing Start moving...
29

Evaluating Cultural Change
Maps show you where to go They also show you where you've been (and how much progress you have made) Cultural transformation projects must regularly self-evaluate
Repeated SCDS surveys over time to see changes in shape Tying culture and awareness to behaviors and activities Analyzing cultural ROI by tying behaviors to the business

Apply Cultural Transformation to Your Own Security Program
Next week
Ask colleagues which culture you have (process, compliance, autonomy, or trust?) Do you get different answers? Are there things that always get prioritized above security? Why? Review your existing awareness program - is it aimed at changing what people do or what they think?
Over the next 90 days
Download the SCDS and conduct your own informal survey of your security culture; give it to your CISO Assess your organization's security culture maturity - can you trace specific behaviors back to priorities and values? Identify three improvements to your awareness program that are culturally specific (gamification, champions, etc.)
Over the next 6 months
Document and evaluate how often security "loses" to other priorities - is it a lot? Measure how well your awareness program improvements have changed the "shape" of your security culture Formally expand your security awareness program, using your results, to drive culture and not just behaviors
