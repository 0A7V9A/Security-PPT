Measuring the status of your cybersecurity

#RSAC

program helps manage security goals

Cybersecurity Framework Core

What gets measured gets done

Agenda
Cybersecurity Framework refresher Measuring your security program Now what you do with the metric

Executive Order 13636 asked for the creation

#RSAC

of a Cybersecurity Framework for all sectors

Executive Order Requirements
Be flexible Be non-prescriptive Leverage existing approaches, standards, practices Be globally applicable Focus on risk management vs. rote compliance
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
Referred to as "The Framework" Issued by NIST on February 12, 2014.

The Framework was developed in partnership

#RSAC

among industry, academia and government

NIST Conducted 5 workshops
Released 3 RFIs

The Framework establishes three primary

#RSAC

components

Framework Core

Implementation Tiers

Framework Profiles

6

The Framework Core establishes a

#RSAC

common language

Consists of 5 Functions
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
Describes a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes
Includes references to industry proven standards
Three levels (Function, Categories, and Subcategories) of fidelity

7

The subcategories describe expected

#RSAC

outcomes

Framework Core

8

Organizations select a Implementation

#RSAC

Tier based on their risk threshold

Three attributes of Tiers:
Risk Management Process
Integrated Risk Management Program
External Participation

Tier 4 may not always be the goal
9

Profiles help organizations capture

#RSAC

their cybersecurity program

10

The Framework establishes a common

#RSAC

language for cybersecurity

11

The Framework identifies seven steps for

#RSAC

developing/improving a cybersecurity program

Step 1: Prioritize and Scope Step 2: Orient Step 3: Create a Current Profile Step 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment Step 5: Create a Target Profile Step 6: Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps Step 7: Implement Action Plan (Build a Roadmap)

12

Where you start is less important than the

#RSAC

accuracy of the information recorded

13

Artifacts generated from implementing the

#RSAC

Framework aide is establishing metrics

Where are we?

How big is the gap? 14

Where do we need to be?

ISO 15504 establishes a standard that can be

#RSAC

leveraged to measure the gap

ISO 15504 Achievement Status
Not achieved (1% - 15%) Partially achieved (>15% - 50%) Largely achieved (>50%- 85%) Fully achieved (>85% - 100%)

Recover

Identify
4 3 2 1 0

Protect

A fifth (5) level was added for projects

that were not started

Respond

A scale from 0 ­ 4 was aligned to the ratings

Detect

15

ISO 15504 achievement rating can be applied

#RSAC

to the gaps

16

The gaps can be summarized at the Function

The status of departments security program

#RSAC

can be measured using the standard

19

Internal assessment provide monitor

#RSAC

continuous improvement

Developed a survey for all departments to complete
The survey monitored departments progress towards achieving the outcomes described in the Target State Profile
Each option represented progress towards their gap closing activity

20

There are several benefits for using the

#RSAC

Cybersecurity Framework

Common Language Collaboration Opportunities Easily Maintain Compliance Ability to Demonstrate Due Care Secure Supply Chain Measuring Cybersecurity Status Cost Efficiency
Rote Compliance
21

Secure

There are several resources available to help

#RSAC

you use the Framework

Government Programs
Department of Homeland Security's C3 Voluntary Program NIST Industry Resources
Internet Resource Centers
Cybersecurity Framework (CForum)

22

You can apply the Framework to track

#RSAC

improvements in your security program

Next week you should:
Determine how the Framework can be used in your organization to measure improvements to the security program
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
Begin having discussions within your organization on your Current state Apply the Cybersecurity Framework to develop/improve a risk-based cybersecurity program for your organization
Within six months you should:
Be able to continually monitor your progress towards achieving Target state outcomes
