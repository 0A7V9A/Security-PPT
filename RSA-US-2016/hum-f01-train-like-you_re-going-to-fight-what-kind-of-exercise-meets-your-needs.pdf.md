#RSAC
What gets in the way
Budget Time Experience in putting an exercise together Unwarranted belief in untrusted skills
9

#RSAC
Who else does exercises?
The usual suspects: Government, DoD, DHS
Usually kinetic. Increasingly including cyber
Healthcare, Finance
Moving from tabletop exercises to more hands-on CTFs Demonstrate planning and response
Utility Companies
Large & medium sized companies (CIP v5)

Types of Exercises

#RSAC
Types of exercises
Table Top Exercise (TTX) Capture the Flag (CTF) Red vs Blue Red on Red Incident Response (DFIR)
12

#RSAC
Table Top Exercises
Just like it sounds
All you need is a table Use a note taker
Applicable to:
All levels (technical through executive) All sections (make the geeks talk to accountants!)
13

#RSAC
Table Top Exercises

Objectives: - Explore scenarios - Verify procedures

Benefits: - Identifies stakeholders - Identifies critical elements of info - Clarifies a taxonomy
Table Top Exercises

Time Frame: - 4-6 hours before eyes glaze over

Constraints: - Not real time! - Beware of hand waving

14

#RSAC
Capture the Flag
Technical
Seen at most (all?) hacker conferences Does everyone get a copy or is it a shared environment?
Applicable to:
Recruits Students Technical staff
15

#RSAC
Capture the Flag

Objectives: - Individual or small team skills - Use the tools

Benefits: - Technical focus - Fun!

Capture the Flag

Time Frame: - 6-12 hours

Constraints: - Development time - Assessment / scoring

16

#RSAC
Red vs. Blue
I attack, you defend Run locally, run nationally
Cyber Patriot National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Inter-service Academy Cyber Defense Exercise
Applicable to:
Students (culmination event) IT Teams
17

#RSAC
Red vs. Blue

Objectives: - Practice defense - See cause & effect in an attack

Benefits: - Fun, fast, challenging - Very stressful situations

Red vs. Blue

Time Frame: - 1 day to a full week

Constraints: - Environment development - Repeatable results?

18

#RSAC
Red vs. Red

#RSAC
Incident Response
Something bad happened Needs a lot of prep or a lot of time
Do you give them disk images? Can you generate enough, realistic, log data?
Applicable for:
Incident response teams Generating results to inject into a TTX
21

#RSAC
Incident Response

Objectives: - Validate Incident Response plans
- Perform DFIR skills - Rapid familiarization of a network

Benefits: - Practice DFIR
- Demonstrate what IR teams do

Incident Response

Time Frame: - Days, especially if evidence collection is included

Constraints: - Environment development

Steps to Making an Exercise - Overview

#RSAC
Don't Panic!
24

#RSAC
Making an Exercise

1. Determine
scope

2. Define objectives

3. Determine
type

4. Create exercise

5. Report

25

#RSAC
Making an Exercise
Sponsor
Who are we going to report the results to?
Scope Definition
What are we going to exercise? Who needs to be involved?
26

#RSAC
Making an Exercise
Objective Definition
Here's what we want to test Here's how we'll test it Here's what we think you're going to do Here's what you did
Task ­ Condition - Standard
27

#RSAC
Making an Exercise
Decide which type of exercise suits your requirements
Table Top Exercise Capture the Flag Red vs Blue Red on Red Incident Response

#RSAC
Making an Exercise - After
Hotwash
Immediately after the exercise Get everyone's impressions, perceptions, gripes, and kudos Answer the sponsor's question: "So how did it go?"
After Action Review
Walk through each objective and inject Results in a report with
Record of what happened Follow ups and due outs
33

#RSAC
Cyber in Kinetic Exercises
Start small: don't derail it or you won't be invited back Stay with published exploits: if you claim "0 Day", you'll get called out Target specific systems/effects = task-condition-standard Manage expectations to make sure they know what's coming
34

#RSAC
An Example of an Exercise

#RSAC
An Example
Sponsor ­ Company CEO Scope - Small company, all sections/directors (about 14 people) Objectives - Continuity of Operations
Do you have plans in place if the company is displaced? Where is the company's data?
Type ­ Table top exercise
36

#RSAC
An Example
Created a simple scenario
Three phases
Created injects in the form of questions
Assigned responsibility for each inject
Scheduled 4 hours in a conference room
Included a scribe with a laptop I facilitated ­ focus on communication between teams
37

#RSAC
An Example
Scenario ­ A fire in the office
Phase 1 ­ The fire is happening Reporting Information dissemination
Phase 2 ­ The inspection Temporary location (1 week to 3 months) What information is needed? Information access
Phase 3 ­ The clean up Prolonged displacement (3 to 6 months)
38

#RSAC
An Example
How it went
IT was defensive Finance and Sales were curious (over confident?) Marketing was the least prepared 5 hours
What we discovered
No backups in Marketing Many leave their laptops in the office (information access) IT relies on email to communicate and doesn't have a backup plan
39

#RSAC
An Example
The follow up
Cloud-based backups Emergency procurement processes Alternative communications paths
Still working on
Alternate locations Data access issues for specialized applications
40

#RSAC
Apply what we've talked about
Next week
Pick 3 processes that need to be exercised Assess your organization
Within 3 months
Develop a Table Top Exercise Deliver the results to potential sponsors
Within 6 months
Explore other, more in-depth exercises Start to plan a training cycle
41

#RSAC
Summary
Five types of exercises
Each exercise is different Pick the type that addresses your objectives
42

#RSAC
Conclusion
Let objectives drive what type of exercise Get everyone involved Resources and time will scale the exercise Reports and follow up are key to holding the next one!
