Other  InteresIng  Trends  
Overall  maturity  in  many  submissions  ­  moving  from  "hacks"  to  "let's   talk  about  how  to  manage  risk"   More  "agile"  security   Second  year  where  frequency  of  "cloud"  and  "mobile"  drop  as  words   as  they  become  ubiquitous   The  term  "Big  Data"  shrinks     INAMOIBW  used  liberally   Less  "Point  of  Sale"  submissions  than  last  year  (when  it  surged)

Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  Security  
Year  2  of  IoT  Surge!  
Cars,  cars,  and  more  cars...   Most  ICS  submissions  we  have  ever  recieved   Hacking  of  every  Thing:  baby  monitors,  medical  devices,  cars,  ...   LegislaJon  discussions  around  IoT  safety  standards   More  maturity  around  the  topic  ­  how  to  defend  devices,   architectures,  frameworks     Surprisingly  li^le  on  "Smart  City"  given  data  from  RSA  Conferences   outside  the  US

#RSAC
Data  Sovereignty  and  LegislaIve  VolaIlity  
Many  submissions  on  the  implicaJons  of  new  and  pending   legislaJon   Data  sovereignty  was  an  important  topic  ­  speculaJon  on  future   moves,  architectures  for  managing,  etc.   Designing  for  potenJally  disrupJve  legislaJve  changes  (Safe   Harbor,  the  use  of  data  for  analyJcs,  etc.)  
11  

#RSAC
Cyber  Insurance  
Huge  surge  in  submissions  on  Cyber  Insurance   PracJcal  discussions  on  how  to  think  about  policies,  planning  for   potenJal  claims,  "raJng"  companies,..."   Sessions  actually  focused  on  using  cyber  insurance  as  a  tool  in   risk  management,  making  tradeoffs,  etc.   Reconciling  cyber  insurance  with  supply  chain  security:   requirements,  etc.

Privacy  vs.  Security  
Seeing  privacy  and  security  communiJes  work  together   Tradeoffs  between  individual  privacy  and  "group"  safety  coming   to  a  head   Debates  on  privacy  legislaJon--EU  at  epicenter  but  spreading   The  implicaJons  of  a  company  or  a  country  "going  dark"     Cultural  realiJes

of  Persistent  Personal  Data  

Well  understood:  implicaJons  of  stolen  credit  card  data  
AcJve  underground  market:  easy  to  sell  CC  numbers  but  low  revenue  per   record  
Time  pressure:  need  to  moneJze  stolen  data  quickly  before  breach  discovered,   cards  deacJvated,  cards  expire,  etc.  
Impact  to  the  vicJm  typically  low/recoverable  
Not  well  understood:  implicaJons  of  breaches  like  Ashley  Madison,  OPM,   healthcare  providers,  ...  
A^ackers  have  the  luxury  of  Jme:  moneJzaJon  sJll  possible  years  later  
PotenJal  for  ransomware,  "protecJon"  susbscripJons,  extorJon,  etc.  
Data  excepJonally  valuable  in  spear  phishing  
Data  cannot  be  "reset"
