What You Need To Know

MU-MIMO
Mobile networks
LTE Advanced
Wi-Fi networks
802.11ac
5G

Omni-directional antennas
IoT networks ZigBee WirelessHart ISA100-11a Wi-SUN Bluetooth Low Energy

18

#RSAC
What About IoT Networks
Requires explicit feedback Size and power performance limitations Multi-hop mesh for reliability
19

#RSAC
Implications
Over-the-air captures are significantly more complex
Arguably some wireless networks are more secure
Hackers would need techniques that minimize use of MU-MIMO
E.g. Disruptive interference
20

#RSAC
What You Should Do Now
Know the limitations of the antenna technologies you are using for analyzing over-the-air traffic Understand disruptive techniques and how to identify them
