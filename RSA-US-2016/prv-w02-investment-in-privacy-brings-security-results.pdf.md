Those who interact with data
No longer are privacy professionals solely compliance lawyers focused on policy
Privacy is moving deeper into the enterprise

Primary duties of privacy pros

#RSAC
Where they sit in the organization

Privacy pros collaborate

#RSAC
· Watch the ethics department ­ that's where we see a lot of growth
· We'll see more pros going beyond the project managers to the designers themselves, to learn more about what products can do
· But clearly it's IT and infosec that are closest

#RSAC
IAPP/TRUSTe study methods
General target: IAPP professionals across the IAPP database
Approach: Online survey sent to approximately 30,000 Daily Dashboard subscribers
Responses: 551 completed surveys (65% privacy / 35% IT+ infosec)

#RSAC
And that collaboration is only increasing

· Half of all companies have increased the number of privacy pros on the infosec team

· The Privacy Venn diagram
· More about people than budget

· Investment in privacy tech is running ahead of external spend on audit and counsel

#RSAC
And that collaboration is only increasing

· Half of all infosec teams now have privacy team members
· And vice versa

· Could government affairs use more infosec professionals now that security is becoming more of a policy issue?

It's the most important thing they do...
· Communication trumps all else ­ how to do? · Privacy working group is a start

#RSAC
It's the most important thing they do...
· Privacy pros want tech, but feel they're not getting it from IT? · Or does IT know best that tech can't solve everything?

How do opinions change when bad things...
· Priorities change almost not at all · The only change in action was an increase in security tech spending

How do opinions change when bad things...
When the regulator comes calling, we see a new emphasis on privacy operations Breaches are about more than the data lost Sound policy before and after a breach can keep a notice from becoming a full investigation

How to apply this information
Make the privacy opps easier: Get out of the Word file era
Get your people talking: Populate your working group; build your teams
Train your organization: Budgets and teams are small; make everyone part of the team
