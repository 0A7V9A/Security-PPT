What You Can Do

#RSAC
Education / Communication
Talking with kids is THE strongest weapon you have. Technology cannot keep up, nor can you outsource parenting.
Mentor your kids on how to behave, just like we do in the real world. Ultimately this is about values.
Ensure your kids feel comfortable talking to you. Ask them to show the technologies they are using and how they use them.
Explain the "Golden Rule" - no consequences when reporting.

#RSAC
Dedicated Computer
Have a computer dedicated just for the kids.
Keep it updated / patched with AV and firewall. Make sure each child has their own, non-privileged account. Have your children be responsible for keeping the computer up to date and secure (let them rebuild it when it gets slow).
My kids only use computer for gaming and writing reports.

#RSAC
Mobile Devices ­ Where the Action Is
Have a central, family charging station. All devices go there when devices are not in use and before kids go to bed. When kids leave house, smartphone has to be on, tracking enabled, and they have to respond to all messages from Mom or Dad (no phone dying due to too much gaming).

#RSAC
Rules Contract

Agree upon rules before giving kids access to new technology (smartphone / tablet, etc). Like any Acceptable Use Policy, you will need to update it as kids get older.
Times kids can or cannot be online.
Tie grades to use of devices, get below an 85 in any class, lose your mobile device.
What they can and cannot do.
Who to report any questions or concerns to.

#RSAC
Grandparents / Family
Just like you train your kids, you may need to train other family members. When kids are at Grandma's, what rules apply, does Grandma know the rules?
What happens at Grandma's stays at Grandma's

Technology
Filtering is active, you to control what activity your children can and cannot do online. Monitoring is passive, it only logs and reports what your children were doing.

#RSAC
Filtering
Most effective for younger children, prevents them from accidently accessing harmful content As children get older, easier to bypass. In addition, as they get older they need more access (i.e. homework) Certain websites are their own `ecosystem' and hard to filter, such as YouTube, Netflix, Steam, Facebook or Instagram.

#RSAC
OpenDNS

Free service, set-up as your DNS server. Will block attempts to connect to any server based on settings. Excellent for filtering website activity and protecting against malicious sites. Poor reporting.

#RSAC
Monitoring
If you want to monitor, start early. Hard to start monitoring when they are 16.
Overwhelmed by data / automated reporting.
For mobile devices, if you want to monitor your kids Android has greatest capabilities.

#RSAC
Set a Good Example
Show your kids how you securely maintain your own computer. When talking to your kids, stop using technology and look them in the eye. Behave on the Internet as you would want your kids to. Don't use technology at the dinner table, late at night in bed or family events.

When You Get Home
· Communication is key, this is not about technology, it's about values. Start the dialogue by asking your kids what are their favorite apps and have them show you how the apps work.
· Create a dedicated charging station for your kids and keep devices in an open area.
· Create a contract for you and your kids.
· Stop using technology when they want to talk to you.
