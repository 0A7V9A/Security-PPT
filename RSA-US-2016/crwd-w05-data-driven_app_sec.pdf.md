From SANS 2015 State of Application Security: Closing the Gap

92% of reported vulnerabilities are in applications, not in networks ­ NIST
Over 70% of vulnerabilities exist at the application layer, not network - Gartner

Organization

Interpretations
Make it formal + distributed
Separation of duties scales better (governance/policy/execution)
Deputize the devs: satellite correlates with better scores
Tailor to your culture, structure

Other considerations
Agile, DevOps, Continuous Integration/Development (CI/CD) "Special" tech, e.g. mobile, cloud, etc. WAF, RASP, IAST, etc.
Stick to the fundamentals! (adapt as needed) More aligned: iterative + continuous = good for security too!

Metrics

Why?

What

Educate executives

The Big 5!

Publish for internal awareness

1st, 2nd order numbers

Enforce the rules

Percent coverage (apps, devs...)

Drive budgets

Speed (time to fix criticals)

Evolve the program (portfolio view) $$$ (lower flaw density)

Identification Compliance Effectiveness Prevention
