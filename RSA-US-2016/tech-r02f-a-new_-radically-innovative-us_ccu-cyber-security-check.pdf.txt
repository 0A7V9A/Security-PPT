#RSAC
Problems with Previous Check Lists
Conventional check lists of security measures, including ours . . .
Make security sound like a static condition Focus attention inward, on the information systems, not outward, on what attackers might do Make it easy to lose sight of what each security measure is supposed to accomplish Deal with items one-by-one, but are only effective collectively Focus more on past problems than on future ones

#RSAC
Our 2007 US-CCU Check List Wasn't Bad

Virtues
Started from scratch, rather than based on previous check lists
Based almost entirely on real experience in the field
Included many guidelines that were not just focused on preventing penetration
Written in simple, non-technical language
Made available for free

Signs It Was Useful
Put into extensive use within weeks of its release
Translated into many languages
Used in over 80 countries
Still being referenced and studied
Probably the most widely used check list that isn't an official standard

#RSAC
But we wanted to tackle the deeper problems
How do we make a check list that is . . .
More dynamic in outlook? Focused more on the attackers & what they might do? Constantly drawing attention to what each security measure is supposed to accomplish? Holistic and systematic, rather than just a list? Oriented toward future security problems?

First, by Starting with the Attackers
The Five Steps in Any Successful Cyber Attack (i.e., five hurdles an attacker must overcome)
1) Find the Target 2) Penetrate the Target 3) Co-opt the Target 4) Conceal What Is Being Done 5) Make It Irreversible

#RSAC
Second, by Looking at All the Attack Avenues

The Six Types of Components in an Information System

1) Hardware

2) Software 3) Networks 4) Automation

(each with further sub-systems)

5) Human Users

6) Suppliers

The Basic US-CCU Cyber-Security Matrix

II. Software Components
III. Network Components
IV. Automation Components
V. Human Components
VI. Supplier Components

#RSAC
To make the US-CCU Matrix more effective, we . . .

 Changed the labels to
emphasize defense
 Added a column to cover "Overview" activities
 Filled in much more of the matrix than current standard practice
 By doing so, made it easier to see where new measures are needed

THE US-CCU CYBER-SECURITY MATRIX

#RSAC
The new matrix labels and organization . . .

Make cyber security outward looking, focused on the specific attack activities each defensive measure is supposed to stop Present each measure as a way of actively defeating an attack action, rather than achieving or maintaining a static condition Remind users to think of attackers as resourceful and creative Make it easier to focus on increasing attacker costs
You can't stop an attacker with enough resources, but you can increase their costs beyond what they would be willing to pay!

www.usccu.us

#RSAC
1) Making the Targets Harder to Find
Force the attacker to spend much more time searching, researching, and mapping Make the attacker's research obsolete sooner and more often Cause the attacker to waste time and resources on dummy targets that don't yield anything Make the attacker worry about uncovering bogus information that will useless or even harmful to anyone trying to use it
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
2) Making the Targets Harder to Penetrate
(Doing what cyber security has already been doing)
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
3) Making the Targets Harder to Co-opt
Make it harder for the attacker to understand how internal operations are carried out Make it necessary for the attacker to go through more steps to co-opt the system Reduce the ways in which the system can be readily manipulated Make the system continually self-correcting or self-restoring
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
4) Making the Attack Harder to Conceal
Look for more symptoms, types, and correlates of attacker activity Lure the attackers into doing more things that will betray their presence Force the attacker to go to carry out more steps to conceal what is being done Make our detection efforts harder to subvert
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
5) Making the Effects More Reversible
Capture and preserve more of the information and conditions that would be disrupted as a result of an attack Improve the systems and activities that substitute for the normal ones as a result of an attack Find ways to undo more of the effects of the attack Reduce the gains to the attacker by finding ways to take away the benefits the attacker has achieved (e.g., poisoning things the attacker might steal)
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
Using the New Matrix to Analyze Attacker Options

A map for identifying the paths and successive actions an attacker would need to carry out
A guide for estimating the time and skill levels needed for a given attack (i.e., attacker costs)
A tool for analyzing and classifying multi-function malware
A method for determining how attacker costs can be most costeffectively increased

No defensive measure has failed if it substantially increases attacker costs!

www.usccu.us

18

#RSAC
Using the New Matrix to Evaluate Defenses
A method for assessing the collective effectiveness of accumulated defensive measures A way of comparing and evaluating defensive products and services A basis for quantifying Vulnerability in a way that can be utilized in a rigorous risk analysis
www.usccu.us

#RSAC
What You Should Do Right Away

Check off your organization's answers! Ask yourself the reason for each unchecked item! (Avoid the excuses for dodging the question!)
Treat the "checkmark boxes" as a starting point, not a goal!
Consider implementing any unchecked items that would greatly increase attacker costs at a modest cost to your organization!
Stop thinking of your job as maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability!
Start thinking of your job as foiling attacks by making it prohibitively expensive for attackers to successfully carry them out!

#RSAC
How to Continue This Effort
Suggest additional items for this matrix! Despite its length and the long research effort, this is only a draft! Help us expand the range of measures and tools, not for stopping penetration, but for economically defeating attackers! Look for a final, numbered version of the US-CCU Matrix later this year (and in other languages, assuming there is enough sponsorship) The US-CCU Matrix is easy to read and available for free! Share it with anyone you know who might be interested!
