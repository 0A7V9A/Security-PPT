The IP cyber theft landscape

Trends fueling IP cyber theft
Digitization of everything
Connection of everyone and everything to the internet
Expanding ecosystems ­ even R&D is outsourced
New technologies, such as 3D printing, continue to introduce new forms and vehicles for IP theft
In a competitive economic landscape, stealing IP is easier and faster than creating it

44%

of executives named loss of IP or strategic proprietary information as one of their top three cyber risk concerns.*

The issue receives growing law enforcement and policy attention.

Many types of IP ­

#RSAC

and theft across many industries

Automotive
· Employee steals trade secrets to foreign competitor for personal gain
Industrial products
· Former employee steals formulas, raw materials information, sales and cost data, product research, marketing data and other IP before gaining employment at a competitor
Energy & resources
· Foreign nationals indicted for stealing designs, financial information, attorney-client privileged communications and other IP from energy product manufacturers

Financial services
· Programmer steals software code owned by a third party
Life sciences
· Scientists charged with stealing employer's biomedical information for resale overseas
Media and entertainment
· Cybercriminals plead guilty to conspiracy for stealing unreleased software, source code, and copyrighted materials
Federal government
· Foreign nationals hacked systems to steal manufacturing plans

Are organizations adequately addressing

#RSAC

the impact of IP theft?

Cyber programs tend to be shaped based on known threats and vulnerabilities
Security controls, detection capabilities, and incident response plans are largely based on the risks associated with volumes of sensitive data records
Organizations expect certain well-known impacts

Costs are incurred and impacts are felt over years, in several phases

Analyze and take immediate steps to stop compromises in progress

Illustrating a case of IP cyber theft

A fictitious technology company

$40B Revenue

Growth rests on innovative products to support management of Internet of Things (IoT) devices

60,000 employees

Hundreds of contracts across many industries, including some very large government contracts

8

#RSAC
Pay $3.75M annually for $150M in cyber insurance
Relatively mature incident response capabilities

#RSAC
Anatomy of the attack they face

In six months, the tech company plans to launch a new version of a core networking product

This product line is expected to yield 50% of the company's revenue over the next five years

!
Day One

Day 10

A federal agency notifies the company that its infrastructure has been breached by a foreign nation-state

An investigation shows that IP tied to 15 out of 30 product lines was stolen

9

Day 40 A tech blog reveals that
the foreign entity is reverse-engineering the
product that is due to be launched

#RSAC
Recovering from the rippling effects

Sales of many products are suspended A major contract is lost Margins and operating efficiency decline

Unplanned legal, public relations, and product development costs
Development plans are accelerated

Contracted for technical and legal services

Accelerated new device release

Began rollout of upgraded firmware

Began data loss prevention and infrastructure upgrade projects
Conducted cyber risk assessment Lost major government contract

#RSAC
Estimating financial impact of the attack

Deriving cost and duration data
Leveraged experience helping companies recover from major cyberattacks Developed fictitious profiles and scenarios based on industry knowledge Used publicly available information on similar companies as benchmark data to derive factors used in direct cost and valuation equations

Calculating direct costs
Relatively simple to approximate based on publicly available information
Leveraged existing studies

PR costs

Customer protection programs

Legal costs
Customer notification
Regulatory fines

11

#RSAC
Modeling potential cyberattack impact

Calculating intangible impacts
Applying professional judgement, accepted financial modeling methods and reasonable assumptions in the absence of detailed, actual data

Financial impact is associated with a specific point in time With-and-without / But-for methodology

Loss of IP

Increased cost to
raise debt

Relief-from-royalty methodology Reliance on assumptions

Lost contracts

Devaluation of trade name

Lost value of customer
relationships

#RSAC
What does it cost?

Total potential impact >$4B
Many of the costs commonly associated with PII-type data breaches do not factor in Greatest impacts are intangible costs The value of lost IP is not the major cost, but the theft of IP has rippling impacts

Improving management of IP cyber risk:

#RSAC

no need to start from scratch

Creators of IP ­ researchers and scientists ­ understand what's at stake Cybersecurity programs have the foundational elements needed
to protect their organizations from threats and vulnerabilities

Business leaders need to drive: Scenario planning based on business impacts Data inventory and classification More attention to insider threat programs

Building a data governance foundation is a huge effort ­ so big that many companies don't want to do it, or no one wants to own it

14

Bridging the gap and engaging

#RSAC

business leaders

Cybersecurity programs continue to focus on the threats, vulnerabilities and probability
More attention should be paid to the true damages a particular cyberattack may cause
By looking realistically at the potential costs, business leaders can right-size investments to better protect their most valuable assets
