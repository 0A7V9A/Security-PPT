Industrial Security Incidents Are Real

ICS security advisories
Most common attack vector used in ICS breaches

Reported ICS security incidents in last year
% of ICS attacks involving APTs

Polish Trains

Event: A Polish teenager modifies a TV remote and hacks Lodz Tram system
Impact: 12 people injured, 4 derailments
Specifics: The 14-year-old modified a TV remote control so that it could be used to change track points. Local police said the youngster trespassed in tram depots to gather information needed to build the device. The teenager told police that he modified track setting for a prank.

Lessons learned:
 Do not rely on protocol obscurity for security
 Apply appropriate access controls to all field devices

#RSAC

Maroochy Waste Water

Lessons learned:  Suspend all access after
terminations  Investigate anomalous system
behavior  Secure radio and wireless
transmissions

Event: More than 750,000 gallons of untreated sewage intentionally released into parks, rivers, and hotel grounds
Impact: Loss of marine life, public health jeopardized, $200,000 in cleanup and monitoring costs
Specifics: SCADA system had 300 nodes (142 pumping stations) governing sewage and drinking water  Used OPC ActiveX controls, DNP3, and ModBus protocols  Used packet radio communications to RTUs Used commercially available radios and stolen SCADA software to make laptop appear as a pumping station  Caused as many as 46 different incidents over a 3-month period (Feb 9 to April 23)

Browns Ferry Power Plant
Event: Two circulation pumps at Unit 3 of the nuclear power plant failed Impact: The unit had to be shut down manually Specifics: The failure of the pumps was traced to excessive traffic on the control system network, possibly caused by the failure of another control system device
Recovery time:  SPDS ­ 4hours 50 minutes  PPC ­ 6 hours 9 minutes

#RSAC
Lessons learned:  Provide adequate network
segmentation  Place controls on multiple
segments to limit congestion and cascading effects  Provide active network monitoring tools

Ukraine Power Outage
Event: Power went out for 80,000 customers in Ukraine (Dec 23, 2015)
Impact: 7 substations had to be manually restarted
Specifics: Email spear-phishing introduced "BlackEnergy" malware into computer networks. This likely enabled remote access that took down the substations Phone systems were attacked, preventing customers from reporting outages. A component of the malware wiped computers, covering the perpetrators' tracks.
Recovery time:  6 hours

#RSAC
Lessons learned:  Employees need ongoing
training e.g., spear-phishing  Implement good network
design and segmentation  Incorporate active network
monitoring tools

Standards and Best Practices

#RSAC
1-2-3 Approach to Industrial Cybersecurity
1. Secure the Industrial Network 2. Secure the Industrial Computers 3. Secure the Industrial Controls

#RSAC
Industrial CyberSecurity 1-2-3 Approach

Industrial Network
· Segmentation · Zoning · Monitoring · Secure wired infrastructure · Secure wireless access

Industrial PCs
· Inventory connected assets · Identify unauthorized &
malicious change · Identify vulnerable & exploitable
systems · Ensure proper configurations

Industrial Controls
· Detect and respond to attacks · Identify unauthorized &
malicious change · Identify vulnerable &
exploitable controls · Ensure proper configurations

#RSAC
Real World Example: The Problem
Regional wastewater treatment plant
Mid-sized city in the Eastern U.S. 24 buildings / 500 pieces of equipment 15 treatment processes 13 million gallons of wastewater daily Runs 24 hours a day every day
Little protection or separation of the SCADA network from the city's IT network
Even the city's high school students could gain access if they tried

#RSAC
The Requirements
Protect critical plant infrastructure from malware, traffic storms, error and attacks
Without giving up the ability to share data interdepartmentally or remote support and maintenance capability
While increasing system reliability by following ISA/IEC 62443 cybersecurity standards
Partition into zones; secure through conduits
Security embedded throughout the system, not just as the perimeter

#RSAC
The Solution: Final Application

#RSAC
Building Resiliency: Industrial Control Systems
Assessing and monitoring control systems with purpose-built, non-invasive technology

#RSAC
Keys to Successful IT / OT Convergence
Next week: Commit to Improving your ICS security skills
 Take a course, read a book, get a PLC training kit
Over the next three months:  Build relationships with OT staff (coffee and lunches) Within six months:  Drive or support efforts to create a collaborative environment
and metrics that emphasize teamwork
