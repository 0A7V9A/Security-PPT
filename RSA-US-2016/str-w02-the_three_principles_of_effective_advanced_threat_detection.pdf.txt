Why Intrusions Are Successful

#RSAC

Attacks are targeted (e.g., via repeated use of polymorphism and metamorphism); Macro-distribution supplanted by micro-distribution.

Powerful attack toolkits available w/ tiered pricing, 24x7 customer support. Ecosystem for buying and selling tools and cybercriminal services democratizes advanced attacks

#RSAC
Stages of an Attack

Recon

Initial Entry

Persist

Install Tools

Move laterally

Collect, Exfil, Exploit

Scanning, Social
network analysis

Spear phish, waterhole, web app vuln removable media, CVEs,
0-days

Privilege escalation, finding run
keys, modifying
scripts

Web shells, dropped secondary malware

Pass the hash, pass the ticket, RDP, CVEs,
remote services

One or more hops, drop zones, data destruction / manipulation

Risk

#RSAC
visibility
is the foundation for mitigating the risk of advanced threats
If you really want to protect your network, you really have to know your network. You have to know the devices, the security technologies, and the things inside it. -Rob Joyce, NSA TAO Chief, Usenix Enigma 2016

#RSAC
identity
is foundational and will matter even more as the threat landscape evolves

#RSAC
Malware Reality Check
Advanced breaches don't have to involve malware: SQL Injection -> Web Shell -> RDP
Advanced breaches can be very simple ­ e.g., credential theft
Every breach involves co-opting of identity (authentication isn't the same as identity assurance)

Identity is More Than Authentication

#RSAC
Application: Short Term
Review your security budget allocation ­ are you overspending on prevention relative to detection and response? Identify what blind spots you have across your IT assets
17

#RSAC
Application: Medium-term
Review your identity strategy. Have you covered the breadth of identity-related use cases? Identify what assets are the most critical (and develop a regular cadence for reviewing and prioritizing those assets)

#RSAC
Takeaways

1

We need pervasive and true visibility

2

Identity and authentication matter even more

3 Embrace and own your risk
