#RSAC
#1&2 Data Breach/Data Loss
What is it?
Data in the cloud that is exposed, lost or inaccessible
New Vectors for Data Breach
Oct 2015 ­ "Seriously, Get Off My Cloud!" ­ Exposure of AWS customer crypto keys Multi-Tenant Architecture Flaws in databases
Data Loss is similar, but exacerbated
Secure Tunnel != Protection of Data Losing encryption key Offline backups
6

#RSAC
#3 Account Hijacking
What is it?
Access to user identity & associated accounts
How have attacks changed?
Reuse of credentials/passwords amplifies impacts of attacks Man-In-The-Cloud stealing copy of synchronization token
7

#4 Insecure APIs

#RSAC
What is it about?
APIs enables cross-cloud compatibility
What are API attacks?
Kardashian Website Security Issues The Buffer attack ­ due to improper OAUTH code

8

#RSAC
#5 Denial of Service (DoS)
What is it about?
An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users
How have attacks changed?
Frequency: attacks per month on the rise Collateral Damage Size: Largest attack in 2004 was 8 Gbps. Now upwards of 400 Gbps Complexity: multi-vector attacks are becoming more common
9

#RSAC
#6 Malicious Insiders
What is it?
A threat to the organization that originates from people within the organization such as employees, contractors, etc..
How have attacks changed?
Amplified for cloud services due to convergence of IT Services/customers under a single management domain Management of Identity once an individual leaves the organization
10

#RSAC
Insufficient Due Diligence
What is it?
Investigation into a CSP prior to signing a contract. Clarity on SLAs
Why does it matter?
You are now more dependent on another provider for success of your business Added complexity of auditing multiple vendors' security Where cloud data resides, different laws apply

Visibility

#RSAC
Problems you want to solve
What Cloud Applications are being used across my enterprise? What type of communication is happening to sanctioned & unsanctioned applications How risky are the cloud applications being used?
Who does it?
Secure Web Gateways Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

Encryption / Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

#RSAC

Making a comeback?

Problems you want to solve
Secure my data & reduce impact of data breach Reduce impact data loss
What do I need?
Use SSL Encryption / Tokenization / Key Management Apply DLP policies for Cloud Applications Governance ­ Retention policy

#RSAC
Watching the User
Problems you want to solve
Trust that proper controls are in place (CSP) Prevent misuse of admin / employee accounts
What do I need?
Identity Management Access Management (audit trail, time-bound access, request for
access)
User Entity Behavior Analytics
15

#RSAC
DDoS protection ­ who does it better?
Problems you want to solve
Service stay up and running during a DoS or DDoS attack
What do I need?
Leverage cloud architecture! Absorption and mitigation of DDoS attacks
16

#RSAC
Researching your cloud vendor
Problems you want to solve
Higher confidence level in the CSPs security posture Incorporate CSPs SLAs and security processes into main IT process Protection
What do I need?
Ask the CSP to share their internal security processes or assessment/audit Legally bind them to assessments. Review/negotiate indemnification clause. Review all SLAs Review of Architecture ­ look for APIs

In Review
18

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
Identify sanctioned and unsanctioned applications in your company
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
Understand cloud administrative accounts & monitor them Review if/where critical company data resides in the cloud Review existing legal contracts with CSPs to understand SLAs
Within six months you should:
Identify new processes to put in place to integrate CSP security with internal security workflow Identify new key technologies for protection of cloud assets
