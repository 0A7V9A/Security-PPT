What is Endpoint Security?

System monitoring

Antimalware

Configuration management
Acceptable use policies

"The policies, processes and technology controls
used to protect the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of an endpoint system"

Endpoint security controls
Data security

IAM

Application security

What About AV?
$5 billion to $7 billion WW market 95%+ penetration rate Historically dominated by 5 vendors History of usurping functionality
Application controls, anti-spyware/adware, full-disk encryption
6

#RSAC
Antivirus Myth and Reality
AV is NOT a commodity product (nor is it "dead") AV management is often delegated to IT operations groups AV is not always well maintained Advanced features:
Not well known or always used Can have a substantial impact on system performance Mixed results in terms of efficacy

#RSAC
NG Endpoint Security Triggers
Network compromise, cyber-attack, or data breach Time and resources necessary for system reimaging Cybersecurity quantum leap
Cybersecurity cavalry to the rescue!
Needs and resource assessment

Endpoint Security Continuum
Advanced endpoint controls

Advanced malware prevention
10

Advanced detection and response (EDR)

#RSAC
Endpoint Security Advanced Prevention
"Hair-on-fire" problem Resource constraints
Staff size, skills, time
Endpoint malware prevention may be one of several cybersecurity initiatives
11

Endpoint Security Advanced Prevention

Problematic shortage of IT security skills

Advanced Prevention Products
New types of algorithms Process isolation or sandboxing Behavioral heuristics Tight integration with threat intelligence
13

#RSAC
Procurement and Deployment

Extensive background
research

RFI/RFP

Product testing

POC

Pilot project

Enterprise deployment

14

#RSAC
Observations
Early stage products have obvious flaws
Extensive customer input into product roadmaps
Scale and manageability are high priority requirements AV replacement is often part of strategy Enhancements may be required
Windows firewall, application controls, etc.
15

#RSAC
Advanced Detection and Response
Progressive skills and resources Strong relationships with existing AV vendor Not hung up on endpoint agents Broad approach to anti-malware based upon data analytics
Network sandbox, threat intelligence, open source tools, custom rules, etc.
Focus on IR automation and orchestration
16

#RSAC
Advanced Detection and Response Products
Data collection- and analytics-centric
Windows logs, system activities, forensic capture, etc.
Various requirements for endpoint data collection
Polling, trigger-based, local collection, central collection, etc. Trend toward real-time continuous collection and visibility
Product GUI and analytics may or may not be important
17

#RSAC
Procurement and Deployment

Basic background
research

Exploration of open source and
commercial offerings

Simple and concise RFI/RFPs

POC including product and
process integration

Pilot project to test scale and
data management

Enterprise deployment

18

#RSAC
Observations
Very demanding user base Best-of-breed mentality Customers will likely
Demand product customization and enhancements from vendors from the start Want to use products to create (and even distribute) custom remediation rule sets
"Big brother" issues
19

#RSAC
Further Analysis
Continuum will continue Rip-and-replace mindset Possible extensions for data security and insider threat Cloud-based control plane? Endpoint security and patching
