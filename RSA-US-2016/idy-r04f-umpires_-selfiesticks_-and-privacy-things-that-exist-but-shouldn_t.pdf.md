API economy

IoT economy

27

#RSAC
How does OAuth work?

OAuth is about consented app connections on behalf of one party (think "social login")

Both are run by the same organization; RO may have many tokens and goes to each AS to revoke them

Gets consent based on the API "scopes" it requested
API endpoints that deliver the data or other "value-add"

RO
resource owner

Consents at run time after authenticating

C
client

Standard OAuth endpoints that manage access token issuance

RS
resource server

AS
authorization server

28

How does UMA work?

UMA leverages

Loosely coupled to enable centralized management hub for delegation, consent, revocation, monitoring, etc.

OAuth to

enable party-

to-party

consent and

delegation

RqP is tested through trust elevation, e.g. step-up auth or "claims-based access control"
29

#RSAC
Enables party-to-party sharing ­ without credential sharing ­ driven by "scope-grained" policy
Subsidiary OAuth tokens protect UMA's two standard APIs and represent each party's consent to engage with the AS

What to do about all this: Apply what you've learned today

#RSAC
If you're a privacy practitioner
Next week:
Reach out to business owner counterparts to ask about "consent vulnerabilities" beyond compliance risk
In three months:
Begin investigating personal data as a mutual corporate and customer asset

#RSAC
If you're a privacy practitioner (cont'd)
In six months:
Collaboratively draw up plans to build more trusted digital relationships that address the autonomy element of privacy for well-rounded business benefit
Privacy and data protection policy Big data governance Consent strategy

If you're a human being
Next week: Start asking key questions about the personal data in your (and your family's) life:
Do I actually control this data? If so, how can I access it? How can I control its further distribution? If not, why not? Do I care?
This may require reading some Ts and Cs...
38

#RSAC
If you're a human being (cont'd)
In three months:
Do a gut check about which services, apps, and personal data situations, if any, left you distrustful or creeped out Decide what your reasonable next actions are
