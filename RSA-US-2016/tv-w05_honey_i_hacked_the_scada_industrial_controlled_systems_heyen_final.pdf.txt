Findings - Attack Intelligence Correlation
Real and malicious attacks directed at Critical Infrastructure Attack count and severity spiked on 9/11 Legacy systems are extremely vulnerable Cloud provider sourcing rapidly increasing Only sophisticated attacks utilize evasion techniques (e.g. TOR) Diversity in attack tools (Simple scanners >>> Professional tools)

Apply ....An Ounce of Prevention
Know your critical ICS devices AND their connections Use layered security AND defense-in-depth Maintain a proactive risk management program Regularly penetration test internally as well as the perimeter Remediate to mitigate vulnerabilities, exploits, and probing Consider HoneyNets as an early warning system Think "Purple"
