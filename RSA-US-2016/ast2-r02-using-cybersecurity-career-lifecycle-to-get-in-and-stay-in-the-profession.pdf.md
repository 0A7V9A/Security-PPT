#RSAC
Is there really a problem?
Not a "new problem", just keeps getting bigger. Reports of millions of vacant cybersecurity positions Effects are real
Lack of cybersecurity talent may be an organization's biggest vulnerability
Question is not "IS" there a problem ­ but "WHAT" is the problem
3

#RSAC
What is the problem?
Majority of open positions are not entry level Industry has taken a knee jerk reaction
Tremendous push to fill the gap through traditional education Training and education programs are popping up everywhere to bring new people into the profession No collaboration between entities Addressing the "headline" and not the problem
4

#RSAC
Identifying the real problem
We continue to be REACTIVE Industry's reactive measure do not allow for a holistic approach
Globally accepted professional career map Build what we need - to be proactive
Use traditional degree and certification programs as they were intended ­ as a baseline Develop well grounded skillsets Identify and use knowledge opportunities that keep pace with technology
The voice of the professional isn't loud enough
5

#RSAC
Addressing the real problem
Stop being a "reactive" profession Intensify the voice of the profession
Use professional associations with members from around the globe with no revenue ties to training or certificates Focus on information or cyber security Diversity of members from all levels of profession Look for a neutral organization
Build on knowledge...

#RSAC
One way to address the "problem"
Use the Cybersecurity Career LifecycleTM to build your knowledge & skills
Built by professionals ­ for professionals Obtain and build on knowledge gained through traditional education and certification programs
