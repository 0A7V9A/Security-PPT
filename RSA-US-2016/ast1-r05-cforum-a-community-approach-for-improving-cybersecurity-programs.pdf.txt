#RSAC

CForum is an online community working

#RSAC

together to improve cybersecurity

CForum continues the conversation started during the NIST Cybersecurity Framework workshops as:
a place to collaborate about measuring and improving cybersecurity
an environment for discussing emerging threats to cybersecurity information and operation technology
a forum for thought leaders to share information

Cyber.SecurityFramework.org

We will answer several primary questions

#RSAC

regarding CForum today

Why was CForum established? What are the objectives of CForum? How do you use CForum?

Format of the presentation follows the CSF steps

#RSAC
CSF Steps 1 and 2 Prioritize, Determine Scope and Orient

Executive Order 13636 asked for the creation

#RSAC

of a Cybersecurity Framework for all sectors

Executive Order Requirements
Be flexible Be non-prescriptive Leverage existing approaches, standards, practices Be globally applicable Focus on risk management vs. rote compliance
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
Referred to as "The Framework" Issued by NIST on February 12, 2014.

The Framework establishes three primary

#RSAC

components

Framework Core

Implementation Tiers

Framework Profiles

7

The Framework Core establishes a

#RSAC

common language

Consists of 5 Functions
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
Describes a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes
Includes references to industry proven standards
Three levels (Function, Categories, and Subcategories) of fidelity

8

The Framework establishes a common

#RSAC

language for cybersecurity

9

We also need a common language to help

#RSAC

normalize and optimize activities

Goal: Comply once ­ use many
NIST identified > 450 commonly used standards & practices
Many of these share categories and families of controls in common
Keeping up with multiple compliance frameworks is resource intensive and costly
Need to express requirements and status to supply chain partners

For example: NIST SP 800-53 Control AC-3,
ISO 27002:2013 A.9.4.1, and IEC 15408 FDP_ACC.2 all point
to "access control" processes

#RSAC
CSF Steps 3 and 4 Current Profile and Risk Assessment

CForum is an online forum for sharing

#RSAC

lessons learned and good practices

Industry leaders such as Tony Sager and Mike Brown help spark security conversations Several hundred users help ensure a balanced approach Relevant topic areas include:
Framework specific training and discussion Topics for individual critical information sectors Next iteration of the Framework Implementation Guidance Supply Chain Risk Management

12

CForum is a free online community bringing all

#RSAC

sectors together

Users can join for free to share experiences and ask questions
Users can take advantage of the examples and lessons learned posted by others
Federal agencies are jump starting but aren't the long-term solution ­ governance will eventually transfer to "Industry"
Assist industry in owning and leading cybersecurity management practices

13

CForum Members Responded to the

#RSAC

2015 NIST Request for Information

CForum members are some of the most CSFinformed participants in the nation. The Forum requested feedback on several aspects of CSF usage, update and governance:
Components that are/are not useful? Additions, changes or removals? Improvements to CSF information sharing? Private sector's involvement in future CSF governance? Transitioning some/all of CSF coordination? How to evaluate whether the transition partner has capacity to work effectively with domestic/intl organizations and governments?
14

#RSAC
Join cybersecurity and industry experts
Experts in cybersecurity are invited to blog Sector specific blogs share relevant information Online collaboration provides access to industry leading experts
A central locations for identifying best practices and guidance on cybersecurity Share your challenges to help others avoid similar pitfalls
15

#RSAC
CSF Steps 5 through 7 Target Profile, Gap Analysis and Action Plan

Improve Security for the Community by

#RSAC

leveraging shared templates

Why re-invent the wheel?
Take advantage of lessons learned by others
Jump start use of cybersecurity resources by using shared templates
Identify opportunities for consistency within and across critical infrastructure sectors

17

Industry leading the evolution of the

#RSAC

Cybersecurity Framework

Our target is for CForum to represent a consortium of security professionals and owner/operators across multiple industries

CForum members and organizations helping to implement:

Private sector's involvement

CSF Governance

Criteria for participation and for providing industry resources

18

#RSAC
Assessing the Gaps and the Road Ahead
The current forum has hundreds of participants but very few are active ­ we need more voices asking more detailed questions. If the site is to provide value, we need more organizations providing anonymized examples of use. This is a community opportunity ­ if we want to continue to have a voice in the continued CSF evolution, we need to share our vision and experience.
19

#RSAC
Action Plan Based on Roadmap
Now that you know where CForum has been and where it's going, we hope that you will join the conversation within the next week. Within three months, share information about how CSF is helping to improve communication in your organization. Within six months, your organization can be demonstrating your leadership and vision as you post profiles, informative references and/or sample action plans.
