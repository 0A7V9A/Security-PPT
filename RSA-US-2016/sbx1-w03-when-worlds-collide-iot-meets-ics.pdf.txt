A Little Background
Back in my day...

#RSAC
Welcome to the New Reality
IoT gives me that "get off my lawn" moment
In only a few short years, access to the internet has gone from a privilege to a right It has also spilled from our PC to our phone to our toys and even our homes No, not in our homes, the actual home.

We've grown up
We have come so far in so little time! Think about those same scenarios today. How about a refresher?

But, Larry...

How does all this new fangled tech hurt us?
More importantly how are these IoT devices impacting ICS?
I don't want this to sound like FUD, but this is a little forward looking into some perceived threats.
I'm of the opinion all of the parts are there Attackers just need to put the parts together

Attack Scenarios
Time to bring the pain

#RSAC
Scenario One
"Hack" the grid with a "bump"
Shed, Demand, Shed, Demand
Control of the A/C with a mobile app local with Bluetooth Needs large area to affect grid, maybe over multiple distribution
Go for a cloud controlled service
Nest, IRIS all interact with Mobile, HAN, HAN devices How do we make this happen?

Scenario Two (1)

But where are the toys coming in to this? Smart Toy is an Android tablet wrapped in fluff Kayla and Hello Barbie can be used for shenanigans Heck, just go for the tablet!
Kids have less training on bad things So many (shady) games, in app purchases and crazy permissions

#RSAC
Scenario Two (2)
All of these are just gateways to other devices
Home Security, car chargers, cars, Amazon Echo anyone?
So many additional interconnects!
None of these have issues...

Banking
Banking was a little harder Banking trojans abound, maybe compromising devices In a strange reversal of fortune...

Healthcare

Connected "medical" devices?
Infusion pumps Fitness trackers MRI machines! (I can't find the images, but check out @Viss' twitter stream
Now if these had issues, they could be used as additional vectors to interact with local or remote SCADA equipment...

Threat Landscape?
Time to get the lawn mower

#RSAC
Critical mass
Every one of these issues give yet another opportunity for interaction between a compromised device to
Other apps HANs and HAN connected devices By proxy, internal Corporate resources
BYOD Possible connections to OT side?

Danger Zone!

#RSAC
State of the Union

Current attacks on ICS/SCADA start at the corporate side of the house
Phishing, Whaling Office Macros, known vulnerabilities 0-day requires significant resource commitment
"Red zone" is the next opportunity!
So many opportunities! So many MORE opportunities for 0-day with lower barrier to entry

#RSAC
Collision course
Past attacks targeted the Corporate side and were stopped there
APT1, OpCleaver
Others, bridged the gap
Havex, BlackEnergy3; "minor" intrusions and impact German Iron Works, Stuxnet, Ukraine; major intrusions and impact

Room for Improvement
Tim Taylor says MOAR POWER!

#RSAC
Head for near miss?
Instead of a collision, why not a near miss?
We will never be perfect, but that "near miss" might be just enough to avoid disaster I use "near miss" as a metaphor, but we should do way better.
How do we make this happen?
3 approaches to 3 different problems: ICS/SCADA, HAN, IoT

#RSAC
This part is hard!

51

#RSAC
A great place

This is in many cases a great place to be Air gapped networks, restricted network access, physical security High level of redundancy, fail safes and manual overrides
Significant amount of Industry regulations help.
However traditional IT security has never been needed here before! Times, they are a changing! This is called "innovation"!
Potential to add more traditional IT security for improvment Detailed monitoring, inbound/outbound firewall

Let's make this harder.

#RSAC
The not so Wild West (1)

HAN/Smart meter as an entry point to points beyond
So let's lock that down and monitor the heck out of it!
Not so fast...
This is where potential benefit comes to consumers and utilities so we WANT connections from customers Should not be unknown devices, communication with utility to activate

#RSAC
The not so Wild West (2)
I think we can improve this!
Protect the information used to autheinticate customers to the utility for adding home HAN devices
Social Engineering Traditional IT/Corporate security programs. HAN based firewall with device profiles with specific permitted protocols and individual commands on the gateways! Read your logs and do IDS
Yes, I'm talking Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)

Wrapping Up
Time to get the lawn mower

#RSAC
Disaster
We have plenty of room for improvement here!
Embedded device design and security Mobile App design and security
Good coding practices Hard coded passwords API access security Wireless protocol implementation and selection
These are endemic problems across multiple industries
Most are traditional IT problems

#RSAC
In Conclusion
Rapid adoption of IoT massively increases attack surface and generates many incestuous attack paths All sides of the house have lots to learn from each other If we don't improve we are doomed to fail, and fail hard We can get there!
Open communication Education
