#RSAC
Bridging the Gap

Buyers
Crisply define what's important to your business.
Write OKRs at all levels of the organization.
Give ops and development a seat at the table.
Think of builders as partners not vendors.
31

Builders
Invest in product management and UX research.
Follow your heart...not the herd.
Listen. Even after the sale.
Think of buyers as partners, not customers.

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
Next week you should:
Buyers should take time to review historical and future Objectives & Key Results (OKRs). Builders should build a list of all lost / not won accounts over the past 12 months.
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
Buyers should write down what success means in terms of people, processes, and technology. Builders should conduct post-mortems on the lost / not-won accounts with the sales, marketing, and product teams.
Within six months you should:
Buyers should circulate a revision of next year's OKRs to the board (and down). Builders should circulate amongst the organization a revision of its roadmap and corplevel messaging.
