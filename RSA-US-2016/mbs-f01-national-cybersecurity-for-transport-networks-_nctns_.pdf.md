Our commitment
"In the realm of the 21st century cloud technology and dynamic world of Cyberspace, what transcends in DHS, above all, is its solemn commitment to protect the United States Government and civilian infrastructures from Cyberespionage and Cyberthreats."
"In the arena of Cyberespionage and Cyberthreats, what resonates with the United States citizens is the protection of their personal freedom, wellbeing, property, and identity from those who are adamant to harm them."

NCTNs Definition
NCTNs are:
The essential focus of the DHS's initiatives to protect global transport infrastructures The inseparable part of DHS's mission critical, social interaction, and sensitive cyber transport systems
6

#RSAC
Model's Goals
To support supply chain components: PSTNs, CCCT), NGN, and GSMs To provide clear distinction between risks and vulnerabilities and how to manage them To prevent threats to the Nation's Sixteen Critical Sectors To facilitate transports' insurance and privacy legislations, policies, standards, etc.

Model Shall
Interconnect vital segments of today's NCTNs with global Cellular Cloud Computing Technology (CCCT)
Facilitate voice and data transport systems through Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs), dial-up, and related legacy and modern technologies
Support implementation of the global transport networks including microwave transmission links and fiber optic capabilities.

#RSAC
Model's Lifecycle Process ­ Use Case
Instantaneously after a probable harmful intrusions, the system simultaneously activates its Risks and Vulnerabilities Prevention Methods:
1. Identifies and blocks threat and abnormality before it can harm a DHS NCTNs. 2. It is bridged to MITRE`s CVE, CWE, and CAPEC databases to be further analyzed and determined
whether any "similar" information exists within these servers. 3. If there is a remedy within MITRE databases, the appropriate "fix action" is activated to prevent the
threat and abnormality from harming the NCTNs; then it notifies other Government agencies, private industry, and civilian stakeholders of the incident, remedy, and all other relevant information. 4. If there is no remedy within the MITRE databases, the system continues to block the threat and abnormality until a "fix action" remedy is found by DHS SMEs. As soon as the remedy is found, it is included in the MITRE databases, for future references, and all of the relevant information is circulated to the appropriate Government agencies, industry, and civilian stakeholders as a warning.

DHS SMEs Support

A few of the Randomly Selected DHS SMEs Testimonials

Mike Roskind: The paper is well written and thoughtful. Supply chain management is critical to cyber and this offers ways to develop a model on known vulnerabilities which can be attributed and shared for risk management. Detecting unknown vulnerabilities is still the country's long pole.
Maxey, Serena: Keep up the great work. Your paper was pretty brilliant.

Starks, George: "A telecommunication Supply Chain Model to Prevent Cyberspace Risks and Vulnerabilities" is a well-supported, well-structured and well-written white paper, which I believe lays a solid foundation that offers DHS the ability to better secure its telecommunication environment, and it was my pleasures to peer review it.
Woodhouse, Allen: It has a lot of promise and no doubt will have lots of senior level support as well.

Tumbarello, Stephen: Your White Paper "A Telecommunications Supply Chain Model to Prevent Cyperspace Risks and Vulnerabilities" is Outstanding! I would easily give it an "A" grade!
Moore, Gerald: This is a very well written paper and I look forward to reading the final draft.
