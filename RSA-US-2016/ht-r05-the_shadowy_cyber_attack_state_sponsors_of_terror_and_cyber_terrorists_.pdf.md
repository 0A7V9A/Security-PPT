Warning. We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places "The Interview" be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to. Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.
The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)
Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.

Response and Mitigation Plan
The vector for a cyber terrorist attack is like any other computer intrusion. Start with the basics. Good cyber hygiene. Baseline your environment. Shield your external websites from "low-hanging fruit" attacks like WordPress vulns, SQLi, and DDoSes. (Is WAF on?) Sweep for NAT'ed RDP-enabled devices and VNC servers. Search enterprise for txt files containing administrator-level passwords. Test cold restore backups of core databases. (No really...you should!) Google alert/monitor social media feeds for targeted attack rhetoric. Security is just good IT operations: Discover -> Patch -> Whitelist -> Blacklist -> Repeat.
