Privacy Governance 101
Good privacy and data security begin with understanding the data you have, and what you do with it.
Collect, store, secure, use, share, and dispose of it.
Privacy and data security are company-wide endeavors
Oversight of the Board of C-Suite Company-wide program managed by relevant stakeholders
Policies, procedures, training, and enforcement FIPPs, EU Data Protection Directive, APEC Privacy Framework, FTC Publications & Guidance

CISO Perspective
Most CISOs: tech, risk background
Embrace ambiguity, risk, contradictions
Fundamental rights vs. best practices vs. good ideas Start with a solid data security policy foundation
Know your data, data flows, stakeholders, context
3rd party and intermediary risk

#RSAC
What it felt like
Competing interests, priorities Conflicting guidance Out of date tech High stakes No standards

#RSAC
General Counsel Perspective
GC is the Art of Balance, mediating between:
Outside counsel: external privacy regulations, laws CISO: Internal security considerations, our context and needs
My primary role is risk management
I rely on technical experts to translate the technical CISO and I intersect on risk management Outside counsel and I intersect on policy
Plan  Build  Execute  Monitor metaphor

Building The Matrix
Agree on Context & First Principles Controls: MUST do / SHOULD do Regulations: MUST do / CANNOT do Lots of grey area left...
19

#RSAC
What we did
Outside expertise, opinion, case law Modeled use cases Residual risk
20

#RSAC
Our solution: The Matrix
9 Regions x 22 Security Controls Color-code based on regulatory risk Used this to model proposed changes Optimize to meet risk, context Heavily based on our context, appetite, regulations
