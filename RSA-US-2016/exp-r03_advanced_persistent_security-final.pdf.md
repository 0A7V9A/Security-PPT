#RSAC
Why The Hype Matters to Us
It destroys our focus It changes the story It asks questions that shouldn't be asked It deflects blame
Bad security vs unstoppable enemy
"If the top organizations can be hit, there is no way anyone will expect us to stop the attacks"
2

#RSAC
The Question That Should Be Asked
Was it really a "sophisticated" attack, or just bad security?
3

#RSAC
The Proclaimed "Sophisticated Attacks"
Hacking Team IRS Ashley Madison Anthem Premera You name it, it's sophisticated according to someone
4

#RSAC
It Can Also Help You
It gets people talking about security Use the narrative to help your cause
If management is concerned about the hype, use it
Highlighting the common vulnerabilities exploited during attacks can get you funding to mitigate similar vulnerabilities Stating how your security would have stopped the attacks would give you kudos
5

#RSAC
Hacking Team
Notable in that they supposedly support law enforcement and had zero day vulnerabilities Embarrassing data to customers Leak of vulnerabilities causing ripple effect
6

#RSAC
Sophisticated?
Password was passw0rd Able to access and download data as engineer Sophisticated: HELL NO! Once inside there was apparently a flat network or easy data access
7

#RSAC
IRS Breach
330,000 records compromised through Get Transcript function
400,000 attempted breaches
Compromised authentication scheme Required "information on the taxpayer had"
Hmmmm....
Criminal downloaded records, filed false tax returns
Stole $50 Million
IRS Commissioner said it couldn't be stopped citing
Smart criminals with lots of advanced computers, hiring smart people OMG
8

#RSAC
Sophisticated?
All the criminals needed were credit reports IRS used commercial system that asked questions with answers available through credit reports Went undetected for 400,000 relatively intensive attempts
9

#RSAC
Ashley Madison
Compromise of clients and client information Led to suicides Led to great embarrassment for others Demonstrated that they did not delete accounts as promised Released sensitive internal documents Revealed that there weren't many real women on site
10

#RSAC
Sophisticated?
SQL injection attacks likely Criminals claimed that network poorly segmented Pass1234 was root password on all servers Poor password encryption used Data not deleted Arrogance
11

#RSAC
Anthem
80,000,000 health care records compromised Largest breach of his type This one was personal Potentially perpetrated by China
Seemed to have signature of Deep Panda, and pandas are from China
A large number of people have government access
12

#RSAC
Sophisticated?
Watering hole attack suspected Compromised administrator credentials Undetected for nine months Massive querying of data
13

#RSAC
Premera
11,000,000 accounts compromised Phishing attack suspected Operated for 9 months Deep Panda suspected again 277 data breaches in healthcare organizations in 2015
14

#RSAC
Commonalities
Improperly segmented networks Detection Deficit Disorder
Ignoring or looking at incidents in wrong places
Failure to white list Not monitoring critical systems Poor awareness No multi-factor authentication Phishing messages
15

#RSAC
Preventing the IRS Attack
Frankly authentication might not be feasible to strengthen Better detection IP analysis Rapid increase in requests Focus on misuse detection
16

#RSAC
The Irari Rules of Sophisticated Attacks

Must not actualize because of a Phishing message
Malware must have been undetectable
Passwords were not easily guessed
User awareness exploited with poor awareness program in place
Known vulnerabilities cannot have been exploited
17

Multifactor authentication in use on critical systems
Passwords were not hardcoded into the systems (or on TV)
Detection capability was in place and not ignored
Proper network segmentation in place
User accounts had minimum privileges

Advanced Persistent Threat or

#RSAC

ADAPTIVE Persistent Threat?

They are Persistent They are a Threat But they are more adaptive than they are advanced Advanced implies sophisticated Sophisticated implies unstoppable

18

#RSAC
APT Assumes Failure
Actually, "successful" APT assumes failure They assume there will be countermeasures in place They assume there will be detection mechanisms They know they need to be adaptive They are proactive
"Be like water" ­ Bruce Lee

#RSAC
"Persistence and focus will get you in"
Rob Joyce
Chief, NSA Tailored Access Office

#RSAC
Advanced Persistent Security
21

#RSAC
Advanced Persistent Security
Fight APT with APS Adaptive Persistent Security, but Advanced Persistent Security is a better buzz term Security programs must be adaptive Security programs must assume failure Designed to presume failure Extrusion prevention > Intrusion prevention
22

#RSAC
Risk Management Implies Failure is Acceptable
IRS hack demonstrates availability requires better detection, not prevention
It can be more cost effective Better detection = Better protection
Security is about Risk Management not perfect prevention Detection and reaction mitigate loss that cannot be prevented Adversary disruption is an acceptable "Security" strategy
Kill Chain Analysis Goal is exit prevention

Optimizing Risk
Risk Optimization Point
Cost
24

#RSAC
Countermeasures
Vulnerabilities

#RSAC
Proaction
Design program always looking for failures Determine where failure is likely to occur Perform threat intelligence to determine likely attackers and attack vectors Implement security countermeasures as appropriate Implement detection Build the ability to modify protection into your program

#RSAC
Defensive Information Warfare

Protection

Detection

Reaction

Protection

#RSAC
Understand what you Value Understand your Threats
What they target What they value Likely attack vectors
Determine your vulnerabilities Prioritize countermeasures based on likely threats and vulnerabilities Address security culture
27

#RSAC
Detection
Understand your Kill Chain Detection Deficit Disorder
Avoid it
Human sensors Constantly examine the data Assume critical assets are being stolen Assume networks are compromised and look for indications

#RSAC
Reaction
Reaction should be anticipated as being a common circumstance Reaction built into security program and architecture Determine who's attacking you
What are their attack methods
Look for additional attacks
Be a hunter
Feedback into Protection Remember, your goal is exit prevention
Extrusion prevention is more manageable intrusion prevention

#RSAC
The Role of Security Culture/Awareness
People have a role in Prevention, Detection, and Reaction A strong security culture prevents incidents
People should behave appropriately
A strong security culture detects incidents in progress
Snowden's coworkers should have noticed suspicious activity Detecting incidents, phishing, etc.
Reaction
Reporting Taking actions to mitigate incidents before they get too damaging

#RSAC
Conclusions
Attackers are successful not because they are advanced or sophisticated, but because they are adaptive and persistent Be adaptive and persistent in response Be proactive Failure is expected Failure can be good Implement Advanced Persistent Security
31

"Apply" Slide

#RSAC
Next week you should:
Determine whether you have a "Security" program or a "Prevention" program
Within 3 months you should:
Reevaluate your awareness program Determine the protection of your critical data Analyze your likely threats Determine if you have Detection Deficit Disorder
Within 6 months you should:
Reevaluate the structure of your overall security program
