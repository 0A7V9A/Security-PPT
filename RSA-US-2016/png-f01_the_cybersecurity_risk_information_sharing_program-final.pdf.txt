Senior Cyber Policy Advisor to the Assistant Secretary, Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, U.S. Department of Energy

#RSAC
How serious is the threat?
Sophisticated, patient actors have gained direct access to control systems
 Presence goes undetected for years
More ICS devices are being connected to the internet, intentionally and unintentionally
Search engines are enabling the discovery and identification of internet facing devices
 Scanning and cataloguing of devices with known vulnerabilities is ongoing

Objectives
Increase awareness of the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) and its robust new model of public-private partnership Recognize the challenges posed by current U.S. laws and policies in getting CRISP up and running Examine how we jointly addressed these challenges Persuade you to pursue similar partnerships

What is the impact of CRISP?
One of a kind partnership Pushing the boundaries of information sharing Current participants provide electric power to 60,107,604 customers - 45.68% of the continental U.S. total

Five Year Plan ­ Mission and Vision
Mission: By utilizing advanced technologies and innovative analytical capabilities:
establish and maintain effective collaboration with energy sector partners through robust bi-directional information sharing
provide energy sector partners with targeted, actionable information to enable requirement setting, detection, prevention, mitigation, and rapid response to emerging threats
Vision: By 2019, an enduring, trusted bi-directional information sharing partnership between the Department of Energy and its energy sector partners significantly enhances the security of energy sector infrastructure systems and improves the U.S. Government's near real-time situational awareness.

Strategic Goal 2: Analytic Platform
Platform is key to managing increasing data diversity and must:
 provide both industry and government with near real-time actionable threat information;
 facilitate collaborative analysis; and  deliver the insight required for crucial risk management decisions.
The platform will also:
 shape and evaluate sensor technologies;  identify capability gaps; and  enhance and help correlate data
12

#RSAC
Strategic Goal 3: Operational Pilots
Investigate technologies and capabilities that improve CRISP Ensure operational activities align with industry priorities Collaborate with DHS, the ISACs, energy sector, and cybersecurity vendors to:
 identify and validate pilot targeted capabilities  review proposals, and select pilot awardees  conduct subsequent evaluation and assessment

1st Operational Pilot ­ Norse-FireEye
Norse Corporation
FireEye
14

#RSAC
Year One Results
Direct results:
 capability (architectural, technology, and process) improvements and/or gaps identified and incorporated by CRISP, Norse, FireEye and the volunteer participants;
 volunteer participants choose to remain in CRISP after the pilot ends
Indirect results:
 raising energy sector awareness of the range of best in class commercially available cybersecurity capabilities while also;
 raising the cybersecurity industry awareness of the unique concerns, challenges, and threats faced by the energy sector
15

#RSAC
Next Operational Pilots ­ ICS Focused
Adding two new national labs Fully implementing machine-tomachine sharing Identifying and employing ICS situational awareness capabilities

#RSAC
Summary ­ We can't wait...
CRISP represents a ground-breaking new model of publicprivate partnership U.S. laws and policies have historically not kept pace with the current cyber threat landscape nor with this type of aggressive partnership DOE and its energy sector partners jointly decided that we needed to act now I encourage all of you to do the same
