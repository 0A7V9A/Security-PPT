Docker + Patterns

+ Patterns
Enterprise Strength Docker

1. Build, deploy and run Patterns with Docker containers for Cloud
2. Brings Enterprise-grade lifecycle management to Docker
3. Included private Docker registry Pattern deployable as a shared service

Improved Performance
· Faster application deployment, start-up and scaling · Higher density deployments · More efficient use of hardware
Portability, Hybrid Cloud, Open ecosystem, Productivity
· More seamless workload movement in hybrid & borderless cloud scenarios · Access thousands of pre-built applications on DockerHub · Simplified configuration management · More consistency across development, test and production
