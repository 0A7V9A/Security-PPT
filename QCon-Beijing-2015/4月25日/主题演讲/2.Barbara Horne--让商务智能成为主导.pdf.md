Business Intelligence Tools and Techniques
Business Intelligence is a wide term, we are using it to describe a strategy that brings together the right tools to push and pull your data through streamlined processes and let the business stay aligned with the needs of the customer. We are also pushing a dashboard driven strategy that empowers each employee to visualize and utilize the data they need to stay aligned with the business objectives.

How Do We Get There ­ DRIVE Innovate with Hadoop
"At its core, Hadoop is a distributed data store which provides a platform for implementing powerful parallel processing frameworks on it. The reliability of this data store when it comes to storing massive volumes of data couple with its flexibility related to running multiple processing frameworks makes it an ideal choice as the hub for all your data"

About Pig and PigLatin
"For those of you who are not familiar with Pig, it is a platform for analyzing large data sets. It is built on Hadoop and provides ease of programming, optimization opportunities and extensibility. Pig Latin is the relational data-flow language and is one of the core aspects of Pig."

About Hive
The Apache Hive TM data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL."

Data Warehousing
Data warehousing incorporates data stores and conceptual, logical, and physical models to support business goals and end-user information needs. A data warehouse (DW) is the foundation for a successful BI program.
Creating a DW requires mapping data between sources and targets, then capturing the details of the transformation in a metadata repository. The data warehouse provides a single, comprehensive source of current and historical information.
Data warehousing techniques and tools include DW appliances, platforms, architectures, data stores, and spreadmarts; database architectures, structures, scalability, security, and services; and DW as a service.

HDFS
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Data in a Hadoop cluster is broken down into smaller pieces (called blocks) and distributed throughout the cluster. In this way, the map and reduce functions can be executed on smaller subsets of your larger data sets, and this provides the scalability that is needed for big data processing.

Cluster
Group of independent servers (usually in close proximity to one another) interconnected through a dedicated network to work as one centralized data processing resource. Clusters are capable of performing multiple complex instructions by distributing workload across all connected servers. Clustering improves the system's availability to users, its aggregate performance, and overall tolerance to faults and component failures. A failed server is automatically shut down and its users are switched instantly to the other servers.

MongoDB and Map Reduce
MongoDB is a document database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a Reduce() procedure that performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance. http://www.mongodb.org/about/introduction/
