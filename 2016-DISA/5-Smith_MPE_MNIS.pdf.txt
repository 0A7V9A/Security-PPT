Multinational Information Sharing

UNCLASSIFIED

· CENTRIXS - Allows US and coalition nations and their forces to securely share operational/intelligence information in Communities of Interest (COI) Network
· CMNT - Provides a transport for coalition information sharing (replaces the use of SIPR)
· VDC - Provides the ability to rapidly establish separate, simultaneous COIs in the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).
· UISS - Provides the single enterprise solution for sharing non-classified information with nontraditional partners for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Recovery missions
· CFBLNet - Evaluates shortfalls in Multinational Information Sharing capabilities by providing continuously available network infrastructure to test technologies with mission partners and ease transition into an operational coalition network environment
· CIAV - Assures interoperability information exchanges and operational information exchange processes

UNCLASSIFIED

Application of MPE Principles, Network Relationships and Characteristics differ
(known steady state relationships vs. unknown situation shaped coalition membership)

MPE Enduring: Strategic Level (information sharing & planning)
 Asynchronous and non-real time information sharing
 Persistent ­ time not a factor  Specified Mission Partners (bilateral or
multi-lateral "Communities of Interest)  Combatant Command (CCMD) HQ
capabilities for Mission Partner engagement/planning  Technologically dependent  Integrated with and enabled by Joint Information Environment (JIE)

MPE Episodic: Operational to Tactical Level (Conduct Operations)
 Synchronous and near-real-time or real-time conduct of operational mission tasks
 Episodic ­ time to establish always a factor  Mission Focused (exercise or contingency
operation)  Unknown mission partners, emergent mission;
unknown duration  JTF and component capabilities for peer to peer
Mission Partner operations  US may not be lead; but must leverage JIE to
contribute DOTMLPF- P & TTPs

"US and Mission Partners collaborate in Mission Partner Environment (MPE) Enduring environments day to day with the

capability to transition to conducting operations within a MPE Episodic for any operation"
