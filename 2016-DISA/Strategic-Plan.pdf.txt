UNITED IN SERVICE TO OUR NATION

DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT
We are at an operational crossroads. We continue to operate
in a contested battlespace, where the barrier to entry is low and oftentimes unchallenged. We must recognize that mission success is defined by our ability to pre-emptively disrupt, degrade, or deny our adversaries, both internal and external, unimpeded access to the information and capabilities of the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN). We must sustain our operations and defenses before, during, and after an attack by reducing the attack surface, continually improving defensive cyberspace operations, and effectively commanding and controlling the DODIN.
We are the premier Information Technology Combat Support Agency that provides and assures command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) to the warfighter. We deliver enterprise services and data at the user point of need. We now serve as the joint operational arm of defensive cyberspace operations, for the Department of Defense.

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY Our Mission requires that we remain purposeful in planning, acquisition, operations, and execution. As the provider for defensive cyberspace and IT combat support for the DoD we will:
· Focus on our global infrastructure of telecommunications and services delivery
-- comprised of a hybrid cyberspace ecosystem of mobile, collaboration, internal clouds, and commercial clouds.
· Synchronize command and control (C2) and senior leadership support to
effectively streamline decision making within all echelons of National and DoD leadership.
· Enable warfighter capabilities from a sovereign cyberspace domain,
focused on speed, agility, and access.
· Reduce costs by eliminating duplication in production and operations.
We will be aggressive in our pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness, and no longer support the operations of legacy and costly applications without senior leadership's approval and direction. We recognize our value added within this mission space and will continually fine tune our efforts. This Agency will remain in step with, or ahead of, our mission partners and proactively evolve capability requirements to meet operational needs.
We will bring the business of defensive cyberspace operations support for the DoD under one roof -- Our Roof.
The Joint Information Environment (JIE) remains the cornerstone of the Department's future ­ providing a secure information framework from which our national senior leaders and joint force commanders, command and control forces that deliver responsive, decisive actions from any device; anytime anywhere.
We will continue to lead the DoD cyberspace and information technology optimization efforts. This includes eliminating Department duplication of effort, capitalizing on the range of commercial cloud solutions, and maintaining the operational cyberspace integrity of the DODIN services we defend, operate, and assure. Our agile enterprise will emphasize on-demand, real-time, 24x7, secure access and availability.

Over the next several months, DISA will:
· Evolve the Joint Force Headquarters ­ DODIN (JFHQ-DODIN) · Deploy and operationalize the Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS) platform · Continue to implement our reorganization · Maintain our superior delivery of capability to our mission partners · Enhance mobility and collaboration capabilities

STRATEGIC PLAN 2015 ­ 2020

This message sets out an action-based plan for the future. Our future state will include common enterprise services and single-user interfaces with multi-level security and normalized data. Cyberspace workforce development will continue to evolve through cooperative efforts with our Intelligence Community (IC) and industry partners to enable a multi-faceted, highly skilled countermeasure to nation states, rogue entities, insider threats, and malicious attacks by hacktivists. We will manage risk within the execution of our cybersecurity mission through standardization, reciprocity, and continuous monitoring to achieve information dominance.

We are a professional and innovative civilian and military team. Along with our mission and industry partners, we will continue to produce valued results. DISA is adapting to the changing cyberspace, technological, and fiscal environments. We will ensure that we monitor our progress through meaningful and measurable metrics and analytics that will be exposed for internal consumption by the workforce.
We are first and foremost The Department of Defense's Defensive Cyberspace IT Combat Support Agency.
We cannot allow ourselves to be held to an era or standards that point to the past and the way "things used to be." We must always look toward the horizon, the next conflict, the next opportunity to answer the call and assist in Defending the Nation and her sovereign interests.
We are DISA -- United in Service to Our Nation!
