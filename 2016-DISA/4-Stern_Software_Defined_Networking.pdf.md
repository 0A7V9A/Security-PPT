Software Defined Everything (SDx)

UNCLASSIFIED

· SDx as implemented means different things to different organizations.

Current focus areas are:

Service Automation

Open Standards/Systems

o Automated provisioning(by design)

Availability

o Improved end-to-end management and service delivery
o Dynamic Bandwidth reallocation and scheduling

Security
o Reduction in requirement for direct equipment access by personnel and management systems

o Less time connected in the "box"/ VM

o Control plane separation from data plane

Programmability

Lower Total Cost of Ownership

DoD Information Core

UNCLASSIFIED

TODAY: DoD Information Network (DoDIN) The globally interconnected, end-to-end set of
information capabilities for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing
information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel.

GOAL: DoD Information Core (DoDIC) The globally orchestrated, end-to-end set of
information capabilities for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing
information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel.

FASTER

Automated Provisioning (AP) provides the ability to drastically reduce provisioning times through customer based service provisioning.

Automation results in a significant reduction in Tier I, II

LOWERS COSTS

Keys Points for the Automated Provisioning Capability

Customer order through DDOE/Storefront
­ Provisioning goal (hardware available): 7 days ­ Actual installation time: 30+ days ­ Demonstrated with automation: 2 minutes!! ­ Capabilities are provisioned ON DEMAND
DWCF Labor Hours per action reduced
­ 5x Reduction of Tier I, II & provisioning labor hours for start, change, or disconnect

Automation = What/Where Knowledge
­ J6/Planners/Operators get current capabilities · Actionable for real time execution
­ DISA service managers get real time capabilities · Actionable to pre-deploy more capacity

ENHANCE C2
PRESERVE:
L1: 100G DWDM L2: IPT-PE (MPLS)

DoDIN is the configuration of interconnected Networks.
DoDIC is C2 of the entire Information Core (Networks, Compute, Storage, and Security).
Eliminates circuit mentality. Focus shifts to services.
Implement with new Backbone Autonomous System
­ Focus on Carrier Ethernet Services ­ Focus on hardening an active control plane ­ Focus on Customer based On Demand Provisioning ­ Focus on Service Level Agreement and mission partner flow
visibility down to the service level (i.e. user experience level) ­ Prove reliability of DoDIC's ability to support legacy TDM
