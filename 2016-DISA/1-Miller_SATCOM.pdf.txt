"Reflecting the conclusions of numerous previous studies on DoD's large and enduring demand for commercial satellite communications (SatCom) services, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and the Secretaries of the Military Departments, in coordination with the DoD CIO, the USD(AT&L), the USD(P), the D,CAPE, and the Commander, USSTRATCOM, will provide Defense Space Council-endorsed commercial SatCom service alternatives to address fiscal, policy, and operational challenges, including specific pathfinder activities that DoD should undertake. DISA and the Secretary of the Air Force will provide the plan to the Deputy Secretary of Defense for approval by September 1, 2014."

Determining the proper mix of COMSATCOM - MILSATCOM

FY2016 NDAA Section 1611 prescribes the wideband AoA study; RMD tasks DISA and the USAF to determine the `appropriate mix' of MILSATCOM vs COMSATCOM for wideband needs.
Note: The AoA addresses wideband comms of all kinds, but the RMD addresses only wideband SATCOM.

Step

Approach for RMD Study

(1) Identify requirements

· Forecast enduring demands, with stochastic model (DISA PF1) · Discuss modifiers of aggregate requirement quantities

(2) Understand

· Describe and analyze candidate solutions in Step 3

potential solutions · Recommend establishing on-going assessment activity(ies)

(3) Evaluate solutions

(3a) Identify effective solutions: (3b) Analyze costs: (3c) Analyze risks:

(4) Decide on solutions (5) Implement and
adopt solutions
(6) Assess outcomes

· Deferred to Wideband AoA and beyond. · Recommend in RMD report that (a) decision authorities must
be willing to accept some levels of uncertainty and risk, and that (b) must specifically collect results to refine future evaluations and decisions.
