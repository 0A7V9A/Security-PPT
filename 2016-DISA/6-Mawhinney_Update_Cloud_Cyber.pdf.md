Intent of Brief

UNCLASSIFIED

The intent of this brief is to provide an overview of all levels as described in the Cloud Cyber Defense CONOPS, to include the C2 and C3 constructs for Cyber Defense.
Defines reporting and data-sharing relationships between the Cyber Defense and Cloud organizations.
It assigns procedures to be performed in response to incidents and events as categorized by DoD.
Introduces the supporting organizations and reference procedures for Cyber Defense of the DoDIN with regards to the cloud:
Expands on the SRG with the introduction of: · Cloud Cyber Defense C2 Model · Cloud Cyber Defense C3 Information Sharing Model

The Cloud Cyber Defense Concept of Operations is meant to "evolve as the procedures are put into practice and new best practices emerge."

UNCLASSIFIED

Old Term (6510) CND= Computer Network Defense CNDS = Computer Network Defense Services CNDSP = Computer Network Defense Service Provider
Old CONOPS Role Name BCND = Boundary Computer Network Defense DoDIN CND= DoDIN Computer Network Defense MCND = Mission Computer Network Defense

New Term (8530) CyDef = Cyber Defense CyDef Services = Cyber Defense Services CDSP = Cyber Defense Service Provider
Proposed CONOPS Role Name BCD = Boundary Cyber Defense DCD = DoDIN Cyber Defense MCD = Mission Cyber Defense

Per Joint Pub 3-12, the move is to replace Computer Network Defense (CND) with "Cyber Defense" terminology.
