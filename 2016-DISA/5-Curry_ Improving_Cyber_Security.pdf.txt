DoD CSR Issues
· Labor-Intensive Manual Event Configuration
 Little time spent on topology validation.  Topology validation usually occurs "in-event" & detracts from event goals.
· Nonaligned Range Infrastructure Segments
 Many Event Capabilities Require Coordination Across All Segments.
· Range Scheduling & Growth Impacted by new demand signal
 Conflict on computing resources/hardware/software.
Way Ahead
 Common Range Automation Framework at all levels of classification.  Automated environment control & provisioning.  Integrated & automated commodity HW, virtualization, & specialty HW control.

DoD CSR v2.0 Next Gen Design

UNCLASSIFIED

Approach
Common resource object definition for CSR virtualization, specialty HW, & commodity HW resources

Benefits · Persistent pool of resource objects enabling subsequent event authoring consistency · Automation objects enabling subsequent event authoring & orchestration efficiencies · Automation objects provide configuration, validation, monitoring, control, &
assessment capabilities
