Sysmon   ...... 


System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across
system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file
creation time. By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents and subsequently
analyzing them, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate
on your network.
