The Revolution in
Private Sector Intelligence
Richard Bejtlich @taosecurity 4 February 2016

Bottom Line Up Front
· We are witnessing a revolution in intelligence capabilities in the private sector, powered by:
­ Imagery from commercial satellites, drones, and smart phones
­ Experts trained by the military and government ­ Collaboration among ex-mil/gov and pure civilians ­ Private job opportunities for these professionals ­ Software, some in the cloud, that enables the above
· The revolution creates benefits and costs, and we haven't figured it all out yet.
