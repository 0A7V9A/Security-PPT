Reducing the Impact ­ Fraud Kill Chain

External Reconnaissance
Target research and collection of information on selected targets

Delivery
Transmission of payload (phish, malware, etc.) to selected targets

Pre-Compromise

Exploitation
Execution of the delivered payload through system vulnerability, social engineering or both

Positioning
Attacker positioning themselves to complete their goals while limiting exposure

Post Compromise/Pre-Abuse

Outside JPMC (Limited Visibility)

Abuse
Attacker takes initial action toward realization

Monetization
Attacker completes goal

Post Abuse Inside JPMC (Visibility)

Cyber Defense Strategy allows a firm to identify attackers earlier in the Kill Chain, reducing the impact of attacks
