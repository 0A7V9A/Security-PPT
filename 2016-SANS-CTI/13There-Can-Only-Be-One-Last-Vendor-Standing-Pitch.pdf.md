There Can Be Only One!: Last CTI Vendor Standing Pitch
Jess Parnell, Centripetal Networks

We Turn Intelligence Into ActionTM
Jess Parnell Director of Information Security

Layered Active Blocking & Logging
· Start with country
blocking
· Inbound drop/no log · Outbound resets/log · OFAC is the easiest
place to start
· ITAR & others unfriendly
to US Law Enforcement

Pyramid of IOCs

· IP: 50.117.38[.]170

IP Address

·

IP hosts many sites

· Domain: opm-learning[.]org

Domain

· URL URL: opm-learning[.]org/badfile.exe

Ref: https://www.passivetotal.org/passive/opm-learning.org Ref: https://www.threatconnect.com/opm-breach-analysis/

Actively Block on New Threats Discovered
· RuleGate® plugin
updates IOCs from FireEye NX series malware sandbox
· Policies
configured to actively block newly discovered IOCs

Send to SIEM: Correlate End-User
· RuleGate® sends events to the SIEM with applied
threat intelligence context in real-time

Why not use my Firewall?

· GEO blocking China

·

~ 300 Million IPs

·

~ 8K RuleGate Rules

· GEO blocking in NGFW

·

Increased Latency

· RuleGate Performance

·

5M+ Indicators/Rules

·

Up to 20Gbps aggregate

throughput

·

< 10µS Latency

RuleGate handles 125x more indicators than the most powerful Next-Generation Firewall
(NGFW) available

Why not use my SIEM?

· NO Active Blocking
Capability
· Avg Security Team has
1-3M Indicators
· Not feasible within
current SIEM
· List-based matching
difficult to manage
· ~28K Breaks SIEM

SIEM is purely for analysis, and has no Active Blocking capability

Is the RuleGate a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)?
· NO it's Threat Enforcement · In-line deployment for Active Blocking

Indicators from Partners you Trust
· Open Intelligence Platform · Open Source & Commercial · Fully Integrated: Automatic
Updates & Application
· Source Multi-Attribution · Technology Integrations
· Malware Detection · Threat Intelligence
Platforms
· SIEM Tools
(not an exhaustive list of Centripetal intelligence sources)

You will NOT be overwhelmed with Actionable Intelligence

· Pivot to Source · Targeted Packet
Capture
· Instant Data Correlation · Enterprise Specific Risk
Models
· Geographic
Visualizations

QuickThreat® - Pivot to Source
