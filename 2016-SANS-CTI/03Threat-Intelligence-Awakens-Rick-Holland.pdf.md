A long time ago in CTI Summits far far way

Threat intelligence
 Providers  Platforms  Enrichment  Integration
8

Many Bothan spies died to bring us this information (Providers)
9

10

Providers
 Pyramid of Pain is painful for threat intel providers too
 Relevancy is hard  Tactical, Operational, Strategic providers
11

This isn't a one stormtrooper fits all scenario
12

13

A TIP should make intel flow like The Force
 Threat intelligence should surround us and bind our security programs together, TIPs should enable this
 Gross misuse of the term "platform"  Answering the relevancy question is a huge
opportunity for TIPs
14

Emerging TIP functional areas
 Ingestion  Enrichment  Analysis/Exploration  Collaboration  Integration/Orchestration
15

Sharing alone does not a platform make
16

Enrichment is delivered to the analyst (Force pull)
17

Enrichment sources
 Passive DNS (Farsight)  WHOIS (DomainTools)  Infrastructure (PassiveTotal)  Malware (VirusTotal)  GeoIP (MaxMind)
18

Take a look in the mirror
 We need to start focusing more efforts on internal enrichment sources
· Identity · Asset · Data value · Vulnerabilities
19

Integrating threat intelligence today is a bit like watching Episodes 1, 2, and 3 repeatedly
20

Integration
 Many APIs are weak (or non-existent)  We perform DoS attacks against our controls  TIPs and the emerging orchestration/automation
players are trying to solve this

There's too many of them!
Indicators of Exhaustion
24

25

Rey is a scavenger
 Before you invest in any commercial provider, you must maximize your own intrusions
 Collect indicators & build dossiers
 No threat intel is more relevant than what is occurring within your own environment
26

> 35 years? And you've never fired a bowcaster? Really?
27

The ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen twelve parsecs
28

She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts
 You don't have the best technology and most expensive intel sources to be effective
 You probably will never have a fusion center but you can make threat intelligence work
 The Millennium Falcon approach (DIY / Open Source tools) is perfectly acceptable
29

Collaborate, find your Bros
30

Collaborate, don't just share IOCs
 For most sharing is putting the cart before the horse
 Share processes & tradecraft  Share cool leather jackets
31

Spawn camping
32

Camp on your adversaries
 Segment the network  Adversaries will re-spawn,
funnel them to make hunting scalable
33

ANALYSTS

That's all she is, yes. A scavenger from that inconsequential Jakku.
35

Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to poor analysis.
36

Avoid analytical pitfalls
37

Avoid analytical pitfalls
Daniel Kahneman reveals "where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking."

Check out: cyintanalysis.com
39

Avoid analysis paralysis
 Actionable intelligence must be timely  Don't spend so much time performing analysis that
timeliness suffers  Ask yourself What Would Han Solo Do (WWHSD)?
40

This can take too long
41

I never answer that question until after I've done it.
42

Easier to track down Luke than to hire intel analysts?
43

Not enough analysts to go around
 Many are going to have to rely upon intel providers and MSSPs for support
 Look at providers who offer analysts on demand or tailored intelligence offerings
44

You need threat intel younglings
45

Retention is critical
 Maturity doesn't just evolve, it can devolve.  You must be creative with retention strategies:
· Remote workers · Training (Individual & team) · Career pathing · Work with HR to create salary exceptions
46

I'VE HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS

#CTISummit

#CTIAwakens
47

Many intel programs are setup for failure
 Buy Buy Buy! Chasing silver bullets  Buy all the feedz!  Not prepared to demonstrate the value of threat
intelligence program
48

Do this
 Conduct after action reviews post intrusion and capture intelligence
 Measure and track - Time to detection, containment, remediation
 Analyze all intel sources and track sightings. Periodically reevaluate sources
 Produce your own strategic intelligence
49

Avoid this
