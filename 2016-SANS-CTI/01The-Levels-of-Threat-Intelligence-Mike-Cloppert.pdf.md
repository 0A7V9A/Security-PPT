The Struggle is Real
My challenge: Convey academic concepts to detail-oriented, technically proficient practitioners who might be skeptical that simple concepts can subconsciously and profoundly influence cognition.
Bias is a natural heuristic ­ a short-cut, or simplification, our brains use to interpret our environment.
These ideas are basic; their imprecision is deliberate. They are controlled biases, where the degree to which they improve our understanding of adversaries is the primary measure of success.

Levels of Threat Intelligence - Overview

· Concept: Degrees of abstraction, like those in established intelligence disciplines, clarify how we think about our own.
Joint Publication 2-0

· Background / motivation
­ A FOR578 student asked about the JP 2-0 ­ I felt stupid and read it ­ I thought "meh" ­ I read it again ­ My brain did a thing and felt funny ­ I did some research ­ My thinking about CTI became much more clear

Who Dis Iz?

Hints: · Was a BAMF · Was Prussian
­ (that means German, -ish)
· Wrote a book on war
­ Not Sun Tzu, though I see the resemblance ­ Literally, titled On War
· Military theoretician, ideas survived emergence of:
­ Mechanized warfare ­ Air combat ­ Chemical, biological, nuclear weapons
Carl von Clausewitz

So what?
Dude's been around awhile... his theories are quite old!

Growing Pains in CTI

The primary purpose of any theory is to clarify concepts and ideas that have become entangled. - Carl von Clausewitz
· Intel-driven CND has grown tremendously
­ Our intelligence corpus ­ Our models and their dependencies, relationships ­ Our capabilities ­ Our workflows
· We now have a spectrum of all of these · The spectrum has caused mis-communications, confusion, conflict · Our domain is so complex, we have experienced entanglement · We need a simpler way to think about this complexity

von Clausewitz: Relevant Theory

· Introduced concepts of tactical and strategic levels of war · Alluded to application of strategy as "operations" · Provided basis for levels of war used through today:
­ Tactical ­ Operational ­ Strategic
· Established intelligence studies borrow from / mimic this · Intelligence, defined...
­ "every sort of information about the enemy and his country ­ the basis, in short, of our own plans and operations" ­ von Clausewitz, On War

And?
Despite being over 200 years old, theories have withstood major changes in capabilities and remain relevant...
if these theories are applicable to us, they will stay applicable to us!

JP 2-0: Joint Intelligence
· 2013 publication written under orders from CJCS Dempsey
· "Guidance for conducting ... intelligence activities across the range of military operations"
· Defines Tactical, Operational, Strategic intelligence levels
· Is collective paradigm for intelligence within U.S. military
· LET'S STEAL i mean BORROW IT!

JP 2-0: Caveats, Considerations
· Document is much more than this presentation · Provides other applicable concepts
­ Will you be attending vol. 4? ;-) ­ Other stuff, maybe?
· Provides insight into how your country's military operates at high level · Our focus is one concept at a time

JP 2-0: Every level mOpaertattieonrasl !intelligence is primarily used by CCDRs and subordinate joint force commanders (JFCs) and their component commanders. Tactical intelligence is used by commanders, planners, and operators for planning and conducting battles, engagements, and special missions.

Perspective

Principles of Joint Intelligence

(OE: Operational Environment)

Intelligence analysts should strive to understand all relevant aspects of the OE. This understanding should include not only the adversary's disposition, but also the sociocultural nuances of individuals and groups in the OE.

Synchronization-- (Synchronize Intelligence with Plans and Operations)

Intelligence should be synchronized with operations and plans in order to provide answers to intelligence requirements in time to influence the decision they are intended to support.

In our domain, we can generally think of the levels thusly:

· Strategic · Operational · Tactical

Nation-state Campaign Intrusion

Intelligence and Command
Intelligence flows up
1. Intrusion 2. Campaign 3. Nation-state
Command flows down
1. Business decisions, needs 2. Collection, processing, assessment
capabilities 3. Alerts, workflows

Strategic Operational
Tactical

Implications to IR Teams
· Org responsibilities, products
­ Part of team mission statements
· Illustrates value of analysis at every level
­ Answers some questions about relevance
· Work may be prioritized independently per level
­ Avoids some aforementioned conflicts
· Analyst perspectives better understood · Provides another facet of staffing levels
­ Many of us are tactical ­ Some are operational ­ Few are strategic
