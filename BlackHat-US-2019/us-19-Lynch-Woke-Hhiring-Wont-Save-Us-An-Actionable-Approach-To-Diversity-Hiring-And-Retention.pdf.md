What this is not about
 Teaching girls to code  Why you should hire more women  Blame and shame

Fewer women entering the workforce

Hiring

Fewer women remaining in the workforce

Diversity and Teams
 1400 participants, 100 teams, 21 companies  Gender balanced teams more likely to
 Experiment  Share knowledge among teammates  Complete tasks on time
Lehman Brothers Centre for Women in Business, Innovative Potential: Men and Women in Teams, 2007.

Diversity and Risk Assessment
 150 studies on gender and risk found correlation between women and increased perception of risk 1
 Women perceive risks as higher than men 2  White men perceive risks as lower than any
other group surveyed
1. Byrnes, J. P., Miller, D. C., & Schafer, W. D. (1999). Gender differences in risk taking: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 125(3), 367-383.
2. Finucane, Melissa & Slovic, Paul & C.K, Mertz & Flynn, James & Satterfield, Terre. (2000). Gender, race, and perceived risk: The 'white male' effect. Health, Risk & Society. 2. 159-172.

The Money
 Strong correlation between increased diversity and increased ROI
 Companies in top quartile for gender diversity 15% more likely to have returns above industry medians

The Cost of Turnover
 Unfairness cited as number one reason for leaving company  37% of people leaving said it was the main factor in their
decision  35% were less likely to recommend the company as a good
place to work  25% were less likely to recommend the product itself

The Cost of Turnover
 Conservative estimate for the cost of turnover due to unfairness at tech companies alone:
$16 billion

Building the Workforce

Fewer women entering

the workforce

Hiring

Fewer women remaining in the workforce

Degrees in Decline
 Steady decrease in women graduating with computer science degrees over 35 years
 One of the only engineering disciplines in steady decline

Attrition in Education
 University of Michigan introductory course almost 40% women 1
 Program overall only 21% women 2

EECS @ University of Michigan, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science 1. Undergraduate Workload Survey, Retrieved from: http://www.eecs.umich.edu

Attrition in Education
 Attrition highest between 1st and 2nd year in program 1
 Majority of women cited "low confidence" regardless of whether their performance was lower than peers 1
 Generally different levels of prior experience  Prior experience not a predictor of success 2

2. Margolis, J. and Fisher, A. (2002). Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

Proposed Solutions
 Teaching girls in different ways  Programming apps for shopping. 1  The pink curriculum increased isolation and attrition 2

What Works? Carnegie Mellon Has Some Ideas
 Building community within the university  Emphasizing no experience necessary  Visibility of different paths into the field

Keeping the Workforce

Fewer women entering the workforce

Hiring

Fewer women remaining in the workforce

Attrition in Employment
 Women in STEM see much higher attrition rate than non-STEM professions
 82% of women "love their work"  100% of women find it
"challenging and intellectually stimulating"

Where Do They Go?
 77% of those leaving cited  Extreme pressure  Hostile "macho" culture
Hewlett et al., (2008)

Implicit Bias

Implicit Bias Is Not
 Sexism, racism

Implicit Bias Is
 Unconscious product of learned behavior

Implicit Bias Is Not
 Sexism, racism  Intentional

Implicit Bias Is
 Unconscious product of learned behavior  Developed over time

Implicit Bias Is Not
 Sexism, racism  Intentional  Fixed with blame and shame

Implicit Bias Is
 Unconscious product of learned behavior  Developed over time  Addressed with conversation and
empathy

When Implicit Bias Becomes Action
 Using "he/his" when describing hypothetical customers or candidates
 Crediting an idea to someone else  Making assumptions about someone's role  Underestimating others' abilities

Kapor Center for Social Impact, (Apr. 2018), Tech Leavers Study, Retrieved from: https://www.kaporcenter.org

Approaching Bias
 Ask questions  Assume positive intent

"She seems kind of
aggressive"

"What makes you say that?"

Horton, A.P., (2019), How to confront bias without alienating people, Retrieved from: https://www.fastcompany.com

Approaching Bias
 Use it as a learning opportunity  Address it privately  Limit the conversation to your
perception

"She is very articulate"

Horton, A.P., (2019), How to confront bias without alienating people, Retrieved from: https://www.fastcompany.com

"I feel like saying that might imply
you assumed otherwise"

Stereotype Threat

Stereotype Threat
 Fear that one will fulfill existing negative stereotypes
 Proven to increase anxiety  Decreases productivity and
performance 1

 Increase visibility of women at all levels 2  Convey high value of diversity 2
 Convey high standards, frame feedback in the context of high standards 3
