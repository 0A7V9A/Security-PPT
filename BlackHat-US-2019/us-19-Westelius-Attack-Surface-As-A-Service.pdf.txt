SWEET SPOT
FOR ACCURATE, ACTIONABLE & SCALABLE SOLUTIONS

HOW DO WE
SCALE
ENABLING AUTOMATION AND MACHINE LEARNING WHILST AVOIDING COMMON PITFALLS

INTERMEDIATE
ATTACK SURFACE
SEPARATED ENVIRONMENT USED TO TEST AND VALIDATE SUSPECT USAGE, ACTION OR BEHAVIOR

WHERE WE SEE SOME ADJACENT CONCEPTS
INTERACTIVE HONEYPOTS, LAYER 7 IDS, ANTI-FRAUD, SPAM, BOT &
ATO SOLUTIONS

TO RETAIN
ACCESS
USERS MUST
COMPLETE TASKS AND TESTS AND
PERFORM AS
EXPECTED

ESCALATED
VALIDATION
& WHAT WE
LEARN FROM
HONEYPOTS

BENEFITS OF
INTERMEDIATE
ATTACK SURFACE
MOVE TARGET

AND EXHAUST
RESOURCES
VALIDATE USERS

BUT WHAT IF IT COULD LEARN?

MACHINE
LEARNING
DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS FOR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WITH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS

ENSAMBLE
ALGORITHMS
META ALGORITHMS THAT COMBINE SEVERAL ML MODELS FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE

APPLYING
MACHINE
LEARNING
IN SECURITY
SHOW US THINGS WE DON'T KNOW
DO THINGS WE DO KNOW FASTER OR MORE EFFICIENT
(AT SCALE)

ISSUES IN

IN SECURITY
SECURITY EXPERTS ARE NOT RARELY DATA SCIENTISTS
DATA SCIENTISTS ARE NOT RARELY SECURITY EXPERTS

PERCEPTION MORE DATA
BETTER
PERFORMANCE
MANY BELIEVE THAT FEEDING MORE DATA TO THE MODEL ALWAYS YIELD BETTER RESULTS

REALITY
SIZE DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER
WHAT MATTERS MORE IS A CLEARLY DEFINED PROBLEM STATEMENT

REDUCING
SCOPE
DEFINING
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
FOR BETTER

INTERACTIVE
REINFORCEMENT
UTILIZING USER INTERACTION AS CONTINUOUS REINFORCEMENT FOR MODELS & HEURISTICS

BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT
TO REINFORCE

GLOBAL

SIMILARITY IN ATTACKS ACROSS MANY TARGETS PROVIDE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
