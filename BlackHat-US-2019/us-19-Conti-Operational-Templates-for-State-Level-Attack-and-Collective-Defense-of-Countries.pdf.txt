How do we defend organizations, economic sectors, and entire nations in cyberspace?

It feels like our adversaries have strategies, and we have tactics. That's not very good. I don't like being in that situation. I don't like having no strategy.

The Rout

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gP2J0CUjc&t=1m12s

"a unit that has taken heavy casualties and/or believes itself about to be surrounded, annihilated or overrun by a superior force may suddenly disintegrate into a state of selfperpetuating mass panic"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rout https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rout#/media/File:Rout_from_Battle_of_Koeniggraetz_Schuellinger.jpg

Defeat in Detail (aka Divide and Conquer)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jIP55IiKSg&t=3m3s

"...bringing a large portion of one's own force to bear on small enemy units individually, rather than engaging the bulk of the enemy force all at once."

Divide and Conquer Works Really Well When we are Already Divided
· We don't really even have a team · We don't really have offense · All of society depends on
networked information systems · Medium and small organizations at
a severe disadvantage. · We will continue being defeated
individually, unless we do something

Defining Collective Defense

"Collective defence means that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies." - NATO

· Collective defense is necessary, no company or sector can stand-alone against state-level threats
· Everyone faces state-level threats, either by chance or by deliberate targeting
· Both the private sector and the public sector need to participate or collective defense is impossible

Collective Offense
The "Kill Chain" happens here

Control of the Network High Ground
 Operating a national telecom comes with a position on the global network high ground
 Exclusive power to create and shape the network environment
 Most countries cooperate in good faith
 Uncooperative entities can manipulate the environment for advantage ...or break it altogether

Control of the Foundations of Cyberspace
 Global supply chains for hardware, software, firmware
 Risks of government influence
 Potential for kill switches, back doors, and other "features"
 Opportunity for a wide range of offensive effects

Combined Operations, Large-Scale Effects

What is a Doctrinal (Threat) Template?
· A model based on known or postulated adversary doctrine.
· Illustrates the disposition and activity of adversary forces and assets conducting a particular class of operation, under ideal conditions.
· Templates are adapted to the given operational environment.
· Depict the threat's preferred way to use its capabilities and perform the functions needed to achieve its objectives.

Approach: Achieve a degree of control over adversary critical infrastructure in order to exert power.
· Hold assets at-risk for deterrence purposes · Conduct shows-of-force · For economic warfare · Create disruption for advantage in an armed conflict

Exert power and induce costs by creating a loss of availability that is more intolerable for the adversary than it is for you.

Approach: Use cyberspace capabilities as intended, at least from a technical perspective, to persuade, dissuade, deceive, and influence.

Inspired by Bruce Schneier, https://www.lawfareblog.com/toward-information-operations-kill-chain, April 24, 2019

O4

The Long Game ­ Death of a Thousand Cuts

Approach: Achieve long term goals through a series of actions each designed to remain below the threshold of meaningful national response.
Achieve a win without the adversary recognizing that there has even been a fight.

Staircase of Apathy

An adversary takes a series of steps over time toward their goal.
Small steps aren't noticed or acted upon.
Large steps are noticed and generate increasingly organized response A smart adversary seeks to operate below an apathy threshold to achieve their goal

... Except when the benefit is so high that an organized response is worth the cost

basis with modest effect · Limited ability to collect forensic information frustrates response · North-South sensor coverage · Suspicion of others in business sector · Working toward CIS Top 20 controls · Misaligned incentives · Primarily signature-based defensive systems · Government works to defend itself · Cybersecurity seen as cost center and impediment to business function

Evolving and Applying Templates
· Develop more Offensive and Defensive Templates
· Corollary: Reverse engineer today's operations too
· Refine the Defensive Maturity Model and extend the Templates
· Link templates to TTP work, wargaming, scenario development, and training/exercises
· Attackers and defenders will apply specific templates to give them an advantage

What Can Help?

Conclusions

· Collective defense is necessary. Individual heroic response (common today) is the wrong answer
· You can win or lose the battle based on your preparations
· Strong organizational defenses are necessary, but not sufficient
· Trust, teamwork, and a sense of urgency are essential for collective defense
· Military strategy and tactics apply (alarmingly) well to cybersecurity
· The Government might provide some leadership, but it won't do it for you
· Feedback is welcome, and see the Whitepaper...
