OVERVIEW
Samsung Devices Use both Samsung's Exynos and Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs The same phone models can have different SoCs depending on the country
Samsung's TrustZone Found only on Exynos SoCs First used in the Samsung Galaxy S3 Trusted OS used: Kinibi developed by Trustonic (Galaxy S3 to Galaxy S9) TEEGRIS developed by Samsung (Galaxy S10) Both are used in other models too This talk will focus on Kinibi

ATTACKING A SECURE DRIVER
VALIDATOR Secure Driver Vulnerability

A vulnerability was found in the VALIDATOR secure driver

Stack-based buffer over ow in the handler of the command ID #15

Equivalent to the one found in the trustlet (i.e. memcpy in the stack and a user-controlled size)

Code execution in S-EL0 but with higher privileges It is now possible to:
Communicate with the RunTime Manager (or RTM, an init-like process) Access more syscalls (e.g. map physical memory, create threads, make SMCs, etc.) Next target: Trusted OS & Monitor

ATTACKING KINIBI AND THE MONITOR
Vulnerability Analysis mmap: secure and non-secure physical memory mapping syscall Vulnerability
Monitor mapped at 0x2022000 Can be mapped using mmap to modify an SMC Calling the hijacked SMC allows code execution in EL3 Patch Fixed in the newest versions by using a blacklist

Code execution in EL3 Now possible to do anything we want!

7.1
POST-EXPLOITATION

7.2
TRUSTPWN FRAMEWORK
Based on the previous vulnerabilities Internals
Uses the EL3 vulnerability to have arbitrary access to Kinibi Adds a SVC and a drApi function to execute code in S-EL1 "natively"
SVCs and drApi functions are referenced in pointer arrays Usage Read or write memory arbitrarily Execute code in S-EL1 and EL3

FINDING THE MASTER KEY IN THE MONITOR
DrApi Reversing
Reversing the crypto-driver drcrypto (found embedded in Kinibi)
DrApi 0x1030 Takes four possible command IDs (0xAA, 0xAB, 0xAC, 0xAD) The interesting one is 0xAB Wrapper around SMC 0xB2000005
SMC 0xB2000005 SMC arguments: R0: SMC ID R0: command number (four possible values [0-3]) R1: number of bytes to read Reads 0x10 bytes of the master key at 0x101E4000
