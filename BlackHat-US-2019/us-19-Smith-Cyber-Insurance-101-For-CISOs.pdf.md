STATE OF THE MARKET 2019
"The cyber insurance market continues to grow and underwriting performance in this sector remains strong. As well as things are going, there are challenges, with uncertainty around pricing being just one. Underwriting business interruption remains difficult. Also, the threat that insurers are most worried about remains a systemic event that could cause extensive losses and jeopardize a cyber insurers solvency."
