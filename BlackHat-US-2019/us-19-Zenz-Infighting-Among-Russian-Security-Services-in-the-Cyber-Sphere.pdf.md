Infighting Among Russian Security Services in the Cyber Sphere
(or how Brian Krebs made the FSB search my apartment)

A Note on Russia

The Current Situation

Escalating Infighting
· Not unique to Russia, but more pronounced than in some other countries, or even in Russia a few years ago
· A range of causes, from geopolitical pressures, economic uncertainty, elite conflicts, shifting power from formal institutions, unpredictable future
· Escalation starting 2014
· A common phrase is "previously unthinkable"

Serious Infighting Outcomes

· Pre-2014(ish): disgrace, departure

· Now: arrest and prison
· Previously safe positions now insecure
· More arrests

National Elites · 35 high-ranking officials
prosecuted · 25 given prison time · 18 more than 5 years

Regional Elite: · 18-20 arrested
· From about 800 regional elites

Why Care?
· Russian security agencies often approached as a monolithic whole, but they aren't that
· Internal politics drives interests of people within Russia's security services
· Security agencies are incentivized to take risks and act aggressively

Observable Infighting - Public
· Media reports of takeover attempts · Reports of transferred responsibilities · Competing cyber doctrines · Similar responsibilities given to multiple divisions · Arrests and their results

Observable Infighting ­ Overlapping Attacks
· Multiple cases of multiple Russian agencies going after the same sectors and even the same organizations
· In Germany, best-known case is that of the German Bundestag hacks
· In US, Democratic National Committee (DNC)

The Accused
· Ruslan Stoyanov · Sergei Mikhailov · Dmitri Dokuchaev · Grigory Fomchenko · Me (indirectly)

The Accusations

· Russian reports: In 2010, FBI paid FSB officers Sergei Mikhailov and Dmitri Dokuchaev $10,000,000 to deliver two CDs containing information about well-known Russian cybercriminal Pavel Vrublevksy

· Shortly before Vrublevsky's arrest and conviction in Russia

· Fomchenko said to have flew to America to deliver one

· Stoyanov said to have given it to an "American (me) at a cybercrime conference

agent"

· Problematic

So Why Then?
· INFIGHTING · More than "Vrublevsky's revenge" · Stepping on other toes? · Treason as a tool
· Chilling effect on information sharing
· Pressure on Kaspersky to re-form and formalize relationship with winners and the state
· Still, something happened to weaken FSB leaders and Kaspersky Lab

Infighting at the FSB
· CIB and CZI have areas of overlapping responsibilities, compete · Reaction to Dmitri Pravikov Case? · CZI visibly influential now · Head of CZI to lead new FSB cyber defense center

Shaltai-Boltai
· "Hacktivist" (extortion) group
· Compromised Russian leadership, some businesspeople
· Blackmailed some, posted some
· Arrested around same time as treason defendants
· Leader Anikeev reported cooperating, charges and sentence surprisingly low, already free
· Rumor
· Mikhailov and Dokuchaev (not Stoyanov or Fomchenko!) investigated them, turned them for money and patron's politics
· Complication: one victim (oligarch Usmanov) caught them doing something else...

Collaboration with the United States
· Two versions of the rumors ­ both assume FSB-GRU infighting · Also just Mikhailov and Dokuchaev · Rumor One: Source of King Servers-ChronoPay connection · Rumor Two: Source of Mueller GRU indictment for hacking DNC · Possibly just an indication of perceived infighting levels

Why Stoyanov?
· Stoyanov not mentioned even in the wildest rumors · He opposed working with cybercriminals · Pressure on Kaspersky
· Kaspersky a close ally of CIB
· Ruslan Stoyanov well known · Bad luck

Results
· Ruslan Stoyanov ­ denied guilt, 14 years in prison · Sergei Mikhailov ­ denied guilt, 22 years in prison · Dokuchaev - plead guilty, 6 years in prison · Fomchenko ­ testified for the prosecution 7 years in prison · Extra
· General Alexander Gerasimov resigned

Lessons Learned

Lessons Learned
· Some people just want to be difficult
· Not all the "good guys" are good
· Some media will get it wrong · Can you trust Brian Krebs? · Can you trust Group-IB?

Lessons Learned
· Some people will surprise you
· American journalists · Russian journalists
· All plans may not be enough · Your broader networks' risks are also your risks
· Good work can be real trouble (but is still worth it!)

Black Hat Sound Bytes
Infighting among Russian security services increasing ·
Drives riskier and more aggressive action abroad ·
It discourages international cooperation and dialogue ·
This makes us all less safe
