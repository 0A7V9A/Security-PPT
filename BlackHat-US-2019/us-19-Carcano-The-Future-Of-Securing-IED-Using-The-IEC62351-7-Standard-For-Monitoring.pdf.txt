(In)Secure Smart Grids: State of the Industry

(In)Secure Smart Grids: State of the Art Today
Technical Challenges:
· Systems are "insecure-by-design" · Passive network monitoring · Limited asset health visibility
People and Process Challenges:
· Shortage of cyber security skills · Immature cyber security processes · Convergence of IT and OT
OT Solution Requirements:
· Safe, effective and efficient security

WG15 and the IEC 62351 Standard

(In)Secure Smart Grids: IEC Standards Improve Threat Detection
IEC 62351 Standard:
v Improves security v Introduces secure network channels v Utilizes network and system management
IEC 62351 ­ Part 7:
v Defines key data objects v Uses SNMP-like protocols v Increases asset visibility v Improves threat and risk detection v Applies to worldwide Smart Grid technologies
(DNP3, IEC 61850, IEC 60870-5)

Passive vs. Active
v Threat detection based on passive indicators is not enough
v Cyber security experts now have deep knowledge of industrial protocols
v Industrial devices already expose SNMP
· RTU, PLC, Switch, HMI
v Active threat detection covers additional scenarios

DEMOS: Active Monitoring in Action

Demo ­ Real Industrial Process

Attack scenarios

· Physical attacks · Ladder-based attacks · Power failure · HMI malware detection
