Japan: CTF for GIRLS
Asuka Nakajima (Security Researcher, NTT)

First Female InfoSec Community in Japan
Overview
 Established in 2014
 Supported by
· Largest CTF in Japan
· More than 30 Japanese companies sponsor
SECCON (e.g., NEC, Fujitsu)
 Started from about 10 members
· Members are all female engineers & students
· Number of members is currently about 30

Why?
My Personal Experience & Opinions from My Female Friends

I don't know where to start..

Difficult to fit into a workshop (community).. Most of the participants
are men....

Maybe infosec is not for women..

First Step to Break this Barrier Make a Female Community

History and current status/activities of three Asian representative female InfoSec communities in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan
How we build and maintain our communities and how we tackle the various challenges such as having a sustainable community
 Comparison of three the communities reveals some of the crucial factors in starting and continuing a female community
