#RSAC
This is an Exciting new Frontier for all of us!
Change the culture!
It's everyone's business not just IT.
OT must be an active partner to be successful.

#RSAC
1
Get executive sponsorship as well as approval of a funding model: federated or centralized.
13

#RSAC
2 Use the NIST CyberSecurity Framework (CSF) to identify gaps in your IT / OT security posture using a cross-functional team from IT and OT.
14

#RSAC

3 IT and OT work together using a risk-

based approach to prioritize those gaps,

Business Impact

then develop a strategic roadmap for

Insignificant Minor Moderate Major Extreme

Probability
Rare Unlikely Possible Probable Certain

closing the gaps based on criticality of

each facility.

#RSAC
4
IT standards and processes will not work for OT: create processes, standards, and reference architectures specific to your OT environment.

#RSAC
5 Start working together - IT and OT - to do the same things done by IT, just differently: · Asset inventory · Firewalls · Security awareness · Patching · Network segmentation · Disaster recovery/Business Continuity · Etc.

#RSAC
6
Detect anomalous or suspicious activity in your OT network.

#RSAC
7
IT and OT work together to create and execute an incident response plan for security alerts from your OT network.

#RSAC
8
IT and OT work together to create a business continuity plan focusing on resiliency of operations.

#RSAC
9
Start with a quick win: provide security awareness training and communications specifically targeted at your production workers.

#RSAC
10
Use the NIST CSF as a common language for both IT and OT ­ use it to get buy-in from leadership, track and report progress, and benchmark.

#RSAC
Timeline for Getting Started
Do the following ASAP:

1

Get executive sponsorship.

Within 3 months:

2
Use the NIST CSF to identify gaps.

3

Use a risk-based approach to develop a strategic roadmap.

9

Provide security awareness training and communications.

10 Use the NIST CSF as a common language.

23

Timeline for Implementation
Within 3-6 months:

Notice that the Top 10 list is #RSAC not in chronological order, but this timeline is!

4 Create processes, standards, and reference architectures.

5 Start working together - IT and OT.

Create a business continuity plan
8

Within 6-12 months: 6 Detect anomalous or suspicious activity in OT. Create and execute an incident response plan.
