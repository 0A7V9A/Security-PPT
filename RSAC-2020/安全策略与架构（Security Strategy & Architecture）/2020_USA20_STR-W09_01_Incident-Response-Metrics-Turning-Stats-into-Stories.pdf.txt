Collecting Your Raw Data

#RSAC
What to Collect (Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hoard Metadata)

 Incident Handling Metadata (SIEM and Service Management), e.g.:

· Endpoints · Firewalls · Authentications · CASB

· Proxy · VPN/Next Gen Access · DLP · Incident Tickets

 Enrichment, e.g.:
· Threat intel · Risk · Vulnerabilities

· UEBA · CMDB · Benchmarking

8

#RSAC
How to Collect It
· Centralize
­ Single collection point accessible to the whole team
· Automate · Stay Consistent
­ Trend = baseline + delta ­ Impact = information + interest

Objectives
· What do want to give your audience?
­ Key information ­ Key attitude ­ Key story
· What do you want from your audience?
­ Compliance ­ Behavioral adjustment ­ Decisions ­ Tools ­ FTEs ­ RSA hotel $$?

A Tale of Two Stories

Audience Objectives

Steering Committee Meeting
Corporate/business leadership presentation
Strategic - high level with lots of supporting info ready Non-technical - avoid jargon Medium - time for fair number of interruptions/questions Physical + remote - mixed engagement styles Skeptical - expect questions re: "areas of opportunity"

Incident Response Team Update
IR team and manager sync-up
Tactical - how we do what we do Technical - acronyms allowed (but still discouraged) Small - heavy mic-sharing Physical - whiteboarding welcome Supportive - you hired them, right?

Give audience - confidence in the IR team & risk posture Get from audience - decisions, exposure, promotion, resources, new metrics?

Give audience - detailed understanding Get from audience - process efficiencies, risk reduction

Selecting Metrics and Building Your Story

#RSAC
Importance and Failings of Metrics
· You won't improve on what you can't measure · Metrics vs Judgement · Unintended Consequences
17

#RSAC
Threats and Exposures
· Events monitored · Number of attacks · Vulnerabilities · Events by location in the kill chain · Highest risk attacks · Threat targets (users, systems)
18

#RSAC
Incidents
· Level of impact · Escalations · Type (malware, unintended disclosure, insider threat, etc.) · Coverage and gaps
19

#RSAC
Team Efficacy
· Time to Triage · Time to Remediate · SLA Breaches
20

#RSAC
Tool Efficacy
· False Positive Rate · Automatic Prevention · Spend · Coverage and Gaps
21

A Tale of Two Stories

Audience Objectives Metrics

Steering Committee Meeting
Corporate/business leadership presentation
Strategic, non-technical, medium-sized, physical & remote, skeptical
Give confidence, get decisions and resources
Threats - number of attacks, emerging threats IR- resourcing Incidents- impact

Incident Response Team Update
IR team and manager sync-up
Tactical, technical, small, physical, supportive
Give baselines, get process efficiencies
Threats- emerging threats, targets Team Efficacy- time to triage, SLA, time to remediate Tool Efficacy- toolset reports, threat intel

22

#RSAC
Analyzing Metrics to Find Stories
· Areas that require more focus or that require more resources
­ Highest impact incidents or Immediate action needed ­ Control deficiencies ­ Emerging risks (people, locations, vector) ­ Proper allocation of budget (tool efficacy, staff resourcing)
23

#RSAC
Analyzing Metrics to Find Stories -continued
· Areas that risk has been reduced
­ Example - New tool correlated with fewer incidents
· Benchmarking and external trends
­ What are others in your cohort seeing ­ What do you need to plan for in the future ­ Are you seeing the same or different events

Building the Story
· Theme · Analogies · Supporting Materials

Applying

Action Plan
1. Choose one high-value IR presentation
1. Use our template to clearly articulate your audience and objectives
1. Identify one metric of interest to this audience that you haven't reported previously
1. Analyze your trends and find your analogy
1. Create a new visual to demonstrate your story
1. Identify two new data points that would bolster your understanding of this metric, and start collecting them!
