How will prevention mitigate the impact of ransomware?
­ Remember, we learned "assume breach" in the 2010s
­ Prevention minimizes the occurrences, but does not address the impact or ability to recover

But wait! How are these "security" solutions?

Distributed
DDoS Resistant
The best solution against a distributed attack is a distributed service

Immutable
Changes Easier to Detect and Reverse
Unauthorized changes stand out and can be reverted to known good

Ephemeral
Drives Value of Assets Closer to Zero
Makes attacker persistence hard and reduces concern
for assets at risk

Thoughts and Considerations
Do our workforce shortage challenges stem more from having too many pets or having too few qualified workers? Should cyber pet ownership require licensed cyber veterinarians? What factors that result in the creation of more pets and how can that be discouraged?
­ AI/ML creates more data pets ­ GDPR/CCPA punishes for the negligence of data pets
The more we thinking about securing something, the less we think about how we can live without it The security industry is incentivized to have us create more pets
/ 17 /

#RSAC
Summary
The next era in IT and Security will manifest more irreversible attacks that challenge and undermine our ability to RECOVER
Better PROTECT, DETECT, and RESPOND capabilities may reduce occurrences of malicious events but are insufficient against well-executed destructive/irreversible scenarios
Our best countermeasure is to avoid pet creation (that requires CIA) and promote cattle creation (built to DIE)

Death to CIA! Long live DIE!

Applying D.I.E.

Next week you should:
­ Get uptime measurements and create your own Pets vs Cattle curve
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Track weekly movement of Pets vs Cattle curve ­ Catalog pet-like and cattle-like design patterns in use within your org
Within six months you should:
­ Create policies and disincentives that discourage pet creation ­ Create triggers to bring awareness to potential pet owners ­ Discover and provide alternatives to pet-like design patterns
