The Cyber Security Collaboration within The K-Sector

Cyber Security Collaboration within the K-Sector
Collaboration's objectives was to address the below main challenges:

1

Absence of a common Cyber Security Strategy Cyber Security activities did not branch out from the Cyber Security Strategy that would be tied to the business strategy.

Lack of Budget The allocation of individual Cyber Security budget for each company in the K-Sector made establishing cyber capabilities an expensive task.

3

Cascading attack An attack in one K- Company could possibly compromise another.
