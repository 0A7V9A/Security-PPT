What We All Want
Innovate fast, stay ahead of the competition, and still be responsible with cyber security. Generate policies that leverage industry expertise around security and compliance from best practices all over the world. Built in security guidance for developers. Provide company leaders with a view into risks. Manage the dynamic nature of continually changing security standards and DevOps technologies.
Bottom Line: Balanced development that achieves both security and speed

Example Security Policies
1. All our software products must be modeled and balanced for cyber security and speed.
2. All our high priority software security requirements must be fixed before shipping.
3. Requirements not applicable must have explicit defensibility explaining why they are not applicable and must be approved by the Director of Engineering. Same goes for requirements where the risk is accepted.
4. All parties in the development lifecycle and supporting roles must be trained on our security policies and procedures.

Making it Stick: Our OKR Journey
Balanced Development OKRs

COMMITTED (100% Delivery)

ASPIRATIONAL (80% Delivery)

· Metrics on delivery of top priority items for the business (regular 6/12 week cadence to avoid drift)
· Security program coordination metrics across multi disciplinary teams
· Continual artifact creation across the security fabric

· Orthogonal innovation
­ Feature prototyping stretch goals ­ Process improvement stretch goals
· Delivery of PoC artifact

Bottom line: Poor OKRs are a waste of time for everyone. We need to answer the question, `Who cares?'

#RSAC
OKRs: What We Learned So Far
Differentiate between security commitments and aspirational OKRs Empathize with the target: internal or external customer focus and how they interact with security Set clear milestones for both speed and security Security stretch goals should focus on innovation Close the security objective only when underlying key results are met
13

#RSAC
Team Leads Drive Balanced Development Practices
We handle security tasks at the Dev level through Team Leads as Security Champions
Product owners focus on features and do not inject security into the pipeline
Dev team uses balanced automation to identify all security tasks and requirements relating to development work within the current release cycle
Work in 2 week sprints, with each release being completed in 3 sprints

In conclusion...

Apply What You Have Learned Today
Short term:
­ Get involved in an industry working group focused on software security
OWASP, IEEE, SAFECode, The Open Group
Mid term:
­ Initiate cross functional security collaboration for balanced development ­ Establish high level committed OKRs that target both speed and security
Long term:
­ Include aspirational OKRs for innovation ­ Go beyond working groups to expand collaboration with industry peers and academia
