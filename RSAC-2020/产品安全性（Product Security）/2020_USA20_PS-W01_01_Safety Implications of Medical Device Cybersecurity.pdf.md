Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)
"Whole of community" approach: Collaboration is key Security spans across the total product lifecycle Impact on critical infrastructure within and across sectors Shifting the mindset: ­ Consider scenarios beyond "intended use" ­ Integrate threat modeling ­ Beware of using probabilistic determinations--these can yield a false sense of
security (avoid `likelihood') Foster culture and create incentives that encourage proactive behavior, especially for information-sharing Major strides made AND acceleration necessary

#RSAC
Framing the Issue
Connected medical devices, like all other computer systems, incorporate software that are vulnerable to threats
We are aware of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents that have directly impacted medical devices or hospital network operations
When medical device vulnerabilities are not addressed and remediated, they can be exploited which can result in:
­ patient harm ­ serve as access points for entry into healthcare delivery
organization (HDO) networks
May lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Medical Device Cybersecurity Background
· Contain configurable embedded computer systems
· Increasingly interconnected · Wirelessly connected · Legacy devices
· Varied responsibilities for purchase, installation and maintenance of medical devices, often silo-ed
· Variable control over what is placed on the network
· Inconsistent training and education on security risks
6

#RSAC
Medical Device Vulnerabilities
· Network-connected medical devices infected or disabled by malware
· Malware on hospital computers, smartphones/tablets, and other wireless mobile devices used to access patient data, monitoring systems, and implanted patient devices
· Uncontrolled distribution of passwords
· Failure to provide timely security software updates and patches
· Security vulnerabilities in the off-the-shelf software that is designed to prevent unauthorized device or network access

#RSAC
Key Principles of FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance
Shared responsibility between stakeholders, including healthcare facilities, patients, providers, and manufacturers of medical devices Address cybersecurity during the design and development of the medical device Establish design inputs for devices related to cybersecurity, and establish a cybersecurity vulnerability and management approach as part of the software validation and risk analysis that is required by 21 CFR 820.30(g)
9

#RSAC
Key Principles of FDA Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices
Use a risk-based framework to assure risks to public health are addressed in a continual and timely fashion Articulate manufacturer responsibilities by leveraging existing Quality System Regulation and postmarket authorities Foster a collaborative and coordinated approach to information sharing and risk assessment Align with Presidential EOs and NIST Framework Incentivize the "right" behavior

Postmarket Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
11

#RSAC
Lessons Learned--Evolving Our Thinking
Coordinated vs. non -coordinated disclosure of device vulnerabilities
­ Ability to get to ground truth as fast as possible so that mitigations can be proactively communicated and executed in a timely manner
JnJ Animas Insulin Pump
­ Non-coordinated disclosure results in delayed assessments, communications, and mitigations
St Jude/Abbott pacemakers and ICDs
Impact on Healthcare and Public Health critical infrastructure and potential disruption of clinical care
­ Patching operating system is not routine with safety-critical systems
WannaCry Global Cyber Attack (May 2017) Petya/notPetya (July 2017) ­ Delays in diagnosis/treatment intervention can result in patient harm too
Potential for remote, multi -patient (i.e., scaled) attack of highest concern for harm
12

#RSAC
Medical Device Safety Action Plan: Advancing Medical Device Cybersecurity
Update 2014 premarket guidance
Explore the development of a CyberMed (Expert) Safety Analysis Board
Consider seeking additional premarket and postmarket authorities to: ­ Require that firms build capabilities to update and patch device security
into a product's design and to include appropriate data supporting this capability in premarket submissions to FDA for review ­ Require firms to develop a "Software Bill of Materials" (SBOM) and to share with customers ­ Require that firms adopt policies and procedures for coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities as they are identified
13

#RSAC
FDA and MITRE
MITRE helping to advance the FDA medical device cybersecurity vision
­ Conducting a medical device cybersecurity stakeholder study ­ Developing a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Rubric for Healthcare ­ Developing a medical device cybersecurity incident response regional playbook ­ Conducting a medical device cybersecurity sandbox pilot ­ Validating the CyberMed Safety Analysis Board (CYMSAB) concept
14

#RSAC

Medical Device Cybersecurity Stakeholder Study

Conducted Medical Device Stakeholder Study with over 80 organizations to identify cybersecurity gaps and challenges
­ Focused on HDOs, MDMs, and cybersecurity researchers
­ Presented results to Healthcare Industry Cybersecurity task force
­ Published article in AAMI BI&T

Evolving State of Medical Device Cybersecurity

15

Medical Device Rubric for Common Vulnerability Scoring #RSAC System (CVSS)

Established a cross-stakeholder working group: medical device manufacturers, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs), cybersecurity researchers, FIRST CVSS Special Interest Group, DHS/CISA, FDA

Reviewed how some manufacturers and healthcare delivery organizations currently use CVSS and concluded that CVSS is a suitable scoring system, but requires better guidance for use in healthcare settings

Developed draft rubric with working group input/feedback

Conducted pilots with manufacturers to validate approach

https://www.mitre.org/md-cvss-rubric

Submitted a qualification package to FDA to qualify rubric as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT)

Medical Device Cybersecurity Regional Incident

#RSAC

Preparedness and Response Playbook

Published regional playbook based on input from:
­ HDO focus groups and cyber exercises
­ Boston-area workshop on WannaCry experiences

Playbook goal: better integrate cyber, clinical and preparedness/ response activities
