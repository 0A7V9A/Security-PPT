The need for product security
Product sales represent the income base for companies Loss of trust in their products can ruin a company overnight Cybersecurity product liability is an emerging field in litigation
­ The risk of a company's product being the source of a customer's breach, or harming a person, creates a huge financial risk
Customers are adding product security specific clauses to purchase contracts
­ Notifications, indemnification, patching

#RSAC
An ace in the hole: the CPSO At the C-Suite level, not buried in R&D
­ Briefing the board on product security as frequently as enterprise security
­ CPSOs need authority to successfully drive product security ­ CPSO should report to the CEO or CSO
