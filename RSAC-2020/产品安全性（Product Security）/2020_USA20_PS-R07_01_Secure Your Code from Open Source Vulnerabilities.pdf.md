Software Development LifeCycle or Secure Development Lifecycle

#RSAC
Stay Proactive Stay Protected
How: Some basic theoretical solutions: - Developers engage security and legal experts. - Get the open source code reviewed. - Once approved ship it.
Can we scale this! NO Why Not: "lack of validation mechanisms" - Approved libs may not be re-validated. - Prone to human errors. - Legal risk compliance requirements. - Lack off feedback loop to re-instate the updatesto outdated libs

Stay Proactive Stay Protected
Some practical solutions: Transition Dev-Ops as Dev-Sec-Ops. - Introduce open source scanning solutions /tools. - These tools with the appropriate security policies defined in tandem with Legal. Counsel can perform the security and legal review during development phases. - Integrate these components in the design and security reviews. - Post deployment checks should be run by using the similar tool set on the Gold Image published for end customers (could be a jar, docker, tarball etc).
