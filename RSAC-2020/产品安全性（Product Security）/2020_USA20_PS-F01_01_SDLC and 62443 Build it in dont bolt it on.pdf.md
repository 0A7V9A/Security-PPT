What is IEC 62443?

Series of global standards that define requirements for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). It covers the entire lifecycle of a product.

In other words:
Customers care because:

To add Security to your Development Process ....
You must have development processes to start with

We do have development processes.....lots of them !!

We found Presenter's Company that they were essentially all the same.

The Nitty Gritty Engineering Details

#RSAC
How we really built security in

#RSAC
Cultural "Experiences"
"We already do this today ­ just clean up a few processes and get them certified!"
"Make sure all groups have a voice and buy-in"
"We do development differently than all other groups in the company ­ our products are different"
"We already have processes, let me show you my 8 tab excel checklist."
"We have a stage gate process. Get it ­ it's our process !"

Company Policy Processes

Security is not optional. Activities and tasks (IEC TR 24774)

Templates

Consistency in outputs

Job Aids Work Instructions
Procedures

How we do our work

Checklists

Things we often forget

#RSAC
A note on process development
Besides understanding what a Process is, these specific areas continue to trip people up
­ Outcome of a Process ­ what would it look like if the process were successfully executed?
Not: The design is signed off Yes: Multiple design options are considered, documented, and communicated to help ensure that future engineers know why a design option was NOT chosen
­ Roles and Responsibilities ­ why are some roles involved in the process?
Not: Moderator: to moderate the review process Yes: Moderator: to ensure that all aspects of the review are sufficiently covered, that time is allocated to do an effective review, and that all issues are dispositioned in a timely manner.

Company Policy Processes

Abstract out activities and tasks that are industry best practices, and do not change often. Built in security and functional safety.

Templates
Job Aids Work Instructions
Procedures
Checklists

Allow (expect) teams the autonomy to define how they execute on the processes, what tools they use, and sometimes what order to do things in.

Company Policy Processes

Focus our 62443-4-1 certification on the true common practices across the company.

Keep the HOW out of the certification discussions. These are execution details.

The Results
"Yes, those are the things we do when we design a product" "Thank you for not telling us how to do our day-to-day job"

"Are you kidding, OMG, all of this is going to extend our project schedules by 20%!"
"We do agile so......" (this seems to be a common answer)
"We already have a (stage gate) process, why do we need this?"

"You are already following a large percentage of the best practices defined ­ and doing them well."

We do this via tribal knowledge We don't really do this Security practices we need to add Doesn't apply to us/this function

We do this, and we do this well!

More Results & Experiences

The "textbook" or 15288/24774 definition of a process isn't commonplace. And that is good and OK.

But following a checklist "Did you do this?" "Did you do this?", etc. isn't a process either.
­ Did you do your requirements ? Check. ­ Did you do your design ? Check. ­ Did you think about security ? Check.
Processes explain WHY the activity is important.
­ Understanding the context the component is used in provides .... ­ A security role in a review is to ensure....

Where do we go from here?
We are still in the rollout, training, & evangelism stage
­ Why a checklist or template isn't a process ­ How a development process is different from a stage gate process ­ Please just try it, I suspect you will like it ­ How this will ease your journey to IEC 62443 certification ­ These are base lifecycle processes ­ security is a fraction of the content
Building influencers in the company at all levels Getting into a cadence of continuous improvement

Apply What You Have Learned Today

Next week you should:
­ Learn more about 62443 if you are in the ICS space. Lots of information on the internet available prior to purchasing the standard itself.
­ Browse through IEC/ISA 15288:2015 and IEC TR24774.
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Take an inventory of the number of product lifecycle or development "processes" your company has.
­ Evaluate if they are a mixture of process, templates, checklists, and job aids.
Within six months you should:
­ Engage members from all functions and business units to abstract out the real "processes".
­ Teams should create or update their own work instructions to reflect how they do their work.
