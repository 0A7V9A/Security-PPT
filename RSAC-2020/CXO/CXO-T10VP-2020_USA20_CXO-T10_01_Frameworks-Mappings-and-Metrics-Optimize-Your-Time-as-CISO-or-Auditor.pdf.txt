#RSAC

Assessment (Part 2 is Prior)

Impact Questionnaire
· 9 Questions.
· Scaled according to an institution's impact on the global, national, and local economies.
· Questions based on global methodologies, such as Basel Committee determinations for GSIBs, transaction volume, and interconnectedness.

#RSAC
Metrics: Principles To Follow (2)
Choose them carefully
­ Input indicators: implement a system/process ­ Output indicators: statistical results ­ Impact indicators: measurable outcome in terms of risk mitigation
Differentiate between your audiences: which ones do you report and to whom?
­ Consider the strategic, operational, risk and control level needs as a CISO ­ Ones that evidence impact on the strategic and business enablement needs of your C-Suite
and Board ­ Your regulator / auditor ­ Other key external stakeholders (clients, insurance...)

The `FS References' and `Informative References' columns detail specific mapping of distinct requirements to the single Profile requirement

Appendix: Impact Tiering Questionnaire ­ Asn Example

Example Off-Ramp for Impact Tier 1
Q1.2 ­ Does your organization consistently participate in (e.g., clear or settle) at least five percent of the value of transactions in a critical market? Check all that apply.

 A. Federal Funds  B. Foreign Exchange  C. Commercial Paper  D. U.S. Government Securities  E. U.S. Agency Securities  F. Corporate Debt  G. Corporate Equity Securities  H. Derivatives

If No to all: Proceed to Criticality Level 2: Subnational Impact and its questions.

If Yes to any: Our organization is designated a Level 1: National/SuperNational impact.

National+ - 1

Legend

Subnational - 2

Sector - 3

Localized - 4

Based on the responses selected, the survey will either off-ramp (once an organization is deemed Level 1: National/Super-National Impact no more questions will need to be answered) OR it will continue until a determination of the impact tier has been reached.
For all tiers outside of Level 1 additional questions will be required to determine the impact tier.
