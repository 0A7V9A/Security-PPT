Goals

Look at physical assessments and how they are run today Case study: mothers, pie and cancer Case study: Iowa, courthouses and how not to (most likely) not get arrested How hard is it to break into a "difficult" location? Dealing with customer reactions You can always be sued. Get over it. The need for outreach. Or, this is really all our fault.

Most assessments... Water, food/package delivery, tailgating, lockpicking, etc.
­ Wash, rinse, repeat
­ Consistency is safe. Consistency is mediocre

· Doing something "different" can be very difficult

Stagnation is bad in security

Fear is not a good pedagogical tool
