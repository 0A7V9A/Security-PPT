TIPS
 What to do to PREPARE  Prepare yourself in advance.  Bullet point your thoughts to keep organized.  Run through your talking points with someone you trust.
 How to make it work (or be successful)  Be fully present.  Keep emotions at bay; composure.  Be clear, concise, direct.  Be open to others' perspectives.  Look for opportunities to create win/win.
