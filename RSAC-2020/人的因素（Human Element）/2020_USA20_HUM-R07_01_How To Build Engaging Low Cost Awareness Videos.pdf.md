Steps to Build Your Own Awareness Videos
Identify your audience and relatable topics ­ Determine what risk/behavior you want to address and how you will appeal to your audience. ­ What emotion do you want them to feel? (happiness, hope, excitement) ­ Think about the types of videos YOU would want to watch
Look for resources ­ Explore in-house resources and other creative departments. ­ Ask for volunteers, get your advisory group involved. ­ Brainstorm, script, shoot, edit
Plan ­ Brainstorm with your team, set-up a storyboard ­ Optimize your filming day (one location, stick to the schedule) ­ Start small, shoot scenes, cut and edit on your phone. Explore user-friendly free editing software.
Measure ­ Track views ­ Conduct a viewer/user feedback group or send out a survey ­ Compare against training, follow-up quiz, or simulation performance
