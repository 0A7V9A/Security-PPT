CISO Job Description
· The CISO position requires a visionary leader with sound knowledge of business management and cybersecurity technologies covering the corporate network and the broader digital ecosystem. As the organization's senior IT security officer, the CISO has enterprise-level responsibility for all data/information security policies, standards, evaluations, roles, and organizational awareness. The CISO is responsible for the establishment and overall management of the information security program for the company, and must proactively work with business units and ecosystem partners to implement practices that meet agreed-on policies and standards for information security. He/She must understand Information Technology and oversee a variety of cybersecurity and IT related risk management activities necessary to ensure the achievement of business outcomes.
· The CISO should understand and articulate the impact of cybersecurity on (digital) business and be able to communicate this at all levels of the organization, up to the board of directors. The CISO serves as the process owner of the appropriate second-line assurance activities not only related to confidentiality, integrity and availability, but also to the safety, privacy and recovery of information owned or processed by the business in compliance with regulatory requirements. The CISO understands that securing information assets and associated technology, applications, systems and processes in the wider ecosystem in which the organization operates is as important as protecting information within the organization's perimeter. A key element of the CISO's role is working with executive management to determine acceptable levels of risk for the organization.
