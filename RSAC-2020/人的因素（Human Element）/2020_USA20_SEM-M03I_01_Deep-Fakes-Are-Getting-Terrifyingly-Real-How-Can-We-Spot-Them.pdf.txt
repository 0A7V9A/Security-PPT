Deepfake Detection Demonstration
Demos document performance of components on a particular test, in specific systems. Differences in hardware, software, or configuration will affect actual performance.

Machine Generated Text

OpenAI GPT2 GROVER BERT ELMo KERMIT

· Generates text using perplexity · Uses the previous N tokens to predict
the next one
· ELMo is a question and answering system
· Models both the syntactic and semantic characteristics of words
· Inserts new text in a sentence · Uses the probability of the new token
given the previous token and vice versa
