Impact of the Data Breach Problem
According to the 2018 Cost of Data Breach Study conducted by Ponemon Institute and sponsored by IBM, the worldwide average cost of a data breach in
2018 was $3.55 million.*
* Ponemon Institute, "2018 Cost of Data Breach Study: Impact of Business Continuity Management," Oct. 2018.

#RSAC
Scope of the Data Breaches Problem
· Data confidentiality refers to the protection of data from unauthorized access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
· Relevant for data at rest, in use, and in transit.
· Lapses in data confidentiality can lead to a data breach.
· A breach may include internal and/or external unauthorized access or disclosure.

Data Confidentiality Projects Provide
Goal: provide a practical solution to identify & protect, detect & respond, and recover the confidentiality of an enterprise's data.
Identify: what assets (devices, data, and applications) may be affected by an incident as well as the vulnerabilities they may possess that allow incidents to occur. It also explores protection measures to mitigate or remediate these vulnerabilities.
Provide: technical capabilities needed by an organization to maintain full awareness of its data as well as mitigate the effects of a data breach.

#RSAC
Impact of the Data Integrity Problem
In the first quarter of 2019, incidence of ransomware increased by 118%.*
* McAfee Labs, "McAfee Labs Threats Report," August 2019

#RSAC
Scope of the Ransomware Problem
· Data integrity refers to the protection of data from unauthorized modification, ensuring that only authorized changes are possible.
· Ransomware represents a loss of integrity so extreme it can limit the availability to any enterprise data at all.
· The inability to reliably access data can sharply impact an organization's ability to conduct its day-to-day operations.
· Any data on a machine, not just user files, can be subject to a ransomware attack. This includes databases, backups, configuration settings, and more.

#RSAC
Data Integrity Projects Provide
Goal: provide a practical solution to minimize the effect of ransomware before, during, and after an attack.
Identify: what assets (devices, data, and applications) may be affected by an incident as well as the vulnerabilities they may possess that allow incidents to occur. It also explores protection measures to mitigate or remediate these vulnerabilities.
Provide: technical capabilities needed by an organization to maintain the integrity of data and information systems. Additionally, provide the capability identify and restore to the last known good backup.

Applying What You've Learned

#RSAC
"Apply" Slide
Next week you should:
­ Identify the most valuable data in your organization. ­ Consider the risks associated with that data.
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Begin enacting steps to mitigate, accept, or otherwise deal with those risks.
Within six months you should:
­ Have an organizational response plan in the event of a data breach or ransomware event. Do your employees react appropriately to a ransom note?
