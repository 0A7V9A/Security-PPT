#RSAC

What do our organisations need from our cyber teams?
Are they delivering?

What are challenges facing our cyber teams?

EFFECTIVE TEAMS

Is there a need for other skills in cyber - in addition to the tech skills?
What are they and how relevant are they in getting the job done?

Are we creating work environments that bring joy?

#RSAC

How much potential talent are there in our organisations?

Are we sufficiently capitalising these potential
talents? Why not?

SCARCITY OF TALENT

What are the fears and perceived risks that gatekeepers have that prevent entry of potential talents?

Are the skills we need innate traits characteristic to certain demographics?

#RSAC

What are the constraints that hinder our D&I efforts to
create a measurable impact?

Are we measuring what works and what doesn't?

D&I EFFORTS

How can we compensate for unconscious bias to prevent biased choices "orchestrate impartiality"?

Is moral licensing a real problem in these efforts?

#RSAC
Let's reframe the problem!

Debunking Myths

#RSAC
Reframing the Problem
Myth #1 : The cybersecurity workforce gap is due to scarcity of talent.
DEBUNK this with: transversal skills + opportunity
>>> due to lack of understanding of the different skills we actually need in teams (tech, business, legal and communication), actively recognise potentials and then grow needed tech skills

Ama's story: Breaking Stereotypes
Immigrant student discouraged by teachers Education: Cultural Studies and Graphic Design
NOW: IAM Consultant in the
financial sector
KEY: transversal skills + self-motivation + OPPORTUNITY
13

#RSAC
Reframing the Problem
Myth #2: Diversity in tech is a pipeline problem not enough minorities have a STEM background
which is absolutely necessary.
DEBUNK this with: aptitude/ability to learn + grit
>>> gatekeepers classify atypical profiles as high-risk hires based on static requirements - atypical profiles are not seen for their potential, motivation and aptitude >>> even with a STEM background, a significant number of women do not choose to have tech career or do not stay, due to other constraints

My story: Grasping Opportunities
Student in Lima, Peru # Dual degree program in Engineering (Peru & Barcelona) # Young Grad Program at SWIFT, Netherlands # Cybersecurity Transition Program
NOW: Endpoint Security Engineer
KEY: ability to learn + grit + positivism
15

#RSAC
Reframing the Problem
Myth #3: (ingrained) beliefs/assumptions success in cyber/tech is due to innate abilities
or traits characteristic to a certain group or demographic
DEBUNK this with: grit + collaborative mindset & empathy

#RSAC
Karin's story: Desire to be seen
Over 25 years in a bank with no career perspective or advancement due to family commitments Education: Mathematics
NOW: Key Manager - IT Cryptographic
Technologies at a major bank
KEY: grit + collaborative work ethic + OPPORTUNITY

What has to be done

#RSAC
Inform and Persuade
Action #1
Capitalise existing potential talent within the organisation >>>Assess the relevant transversal skills needed in teams
19

#RSAC
Inform and Persuade
Action #2
Recognise the dynamic nature of talent, skill and potential
>>>Skill and talent increase significantly with grit + persistence + long-term commitment & motivation
20

#RSAC
Inform and Persuade
Action #3
Challenge knee-jerk reactions -
Examine perceived risks and constraints (lack of tech skills, age, cultural background, etc)
- do a cost-benefit analysis
21

#RSAC
Tying it all together

#RSAC
Tying it all together...
1
Needs of our organisations
dynamic, multi-layered and complex
>>> we need varied skill sets in our teams!
23

#RSAC
Tying it all together...
2
Scarcity of talent is not something we have to live with:
BIG POTENTIAL: Career Transitions
Maintain and sustain talent and knowledge within organisations >> they are already in our organisations, right in front of our noses
24

#RSAC
Tying it all together...
3
Intentional diversity and inclusion is not the easy path-
pain is worth the gain
25

#RSAC
...we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue... To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle. In general, one is only right when either wish or fear coincides with reality.
- George Orwell, London, 1946

"Apply" Slide
Next week do this:
­ TALK to your team about the kind of work environment that would make team more effective, and what kind of skills needed to supplement tech skills, and who could mentor new team members
Next three months do this:
­ DISCUSS with stakeholders - executive management, HR team, CISO: ­ (1) gauge willingness to try something new, based on the principle of a growth mindset ­ (2) pitch the idea to GROW cognitive diverse teams by creating opportunities to potential talents ­ (3) recognise roadblocks and barriers - real, perceived or based on ingrained biases, or inertia to
change
Within six months do this:
­ Create a survey to gather info on the interest for pivots into cyber (involving after-office hours studies and training, certification exams), and among security professionals - who would be interested in giving training and mentorship to colleagues working towards a career transition
