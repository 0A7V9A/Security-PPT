2. Body Language ­ Men and women show/read signs differently
Silent Movie Exercise Men
Studies indicate men tend to lie to appear more powerful If men like you, they generally point their toes toward you Recommendation: Approach women from an angle, not from behind; it's less threatening Women Studies indicate women tend to lie to avoid hurting other people's feelings Recommendation: Avoid crossing your arms

anxiety but not approval Scratching back of neck ­ still have questions and want answers Light touch on hand ­ instant connection and an affinity for you Hand under chin ­ still weighing a decision and coming to a conclusion
