Cyberstorm 2.0 | Key Factors In Today's Threat Landscape...
Various Industry-Wide Developments Are Making It More Difficult To Define & Protect Against The Challenging Threat Landscape.

Automation & AI-Powered Attacks
Automation is a double-edged sword, it makes defenses better, but attackers employ it to execute wider attack campaigns
Hacking algorithms will only continue to get better, as AI can be trained to ultimately seek & exploit vulnerabilities in any network
Driving hyperscale volume & complexity of threats
Nation States Involvement
There are "no rules" & nothing is off limits for nation states; they are not afraid to use guerilla tactics & attack where enterprises least expect it
Demonstrated ability and willingness to target elections & other critical infrastructure that have profound effects on society
Foreign actors have increasingly strong AI capabilities, making it more difficult to track and respond to nation state attacks

Information Manipulation Fake news, deep fakes, etc. use new tactics that traditional Cyber defenses cannot prevent to accomplish similar end-goals of Cyber attacks Since information manipulation is a relatively new threat category, it does not fit into Cybersecurity's traditional taxonomy Not as frequently discussed as other Cyber threats because there is little currently known on how to defend against it Growing Sentiment That Things Are Getting Worse Data suggests that the overall perception from experts is that broad security posture is continuously deteriorating

...Leading Enterprises To Modernize Their Cybersecurity Posture
Organizations Must Continue To Evolve Their Defense Systems To Be More Adaptable & Nimbler To Handle Modern / Next-Gen Threats.

Automation & AI-Powered Defenses
Automated security tools creating a fairer fight against highly automated offensive attacks
Enables dynamic policy updates across security products to defend against continuously changing attacks
Predictive protection against current and future attack behavior instead of static prevention and reactive response
Virtualization
Advanced security functions that have traditionally only been available in hardware can be consumed virtually
Resulting in lighter-weight, more nimble, flexible defenses with the same advanced security capabilities
The future of security is moving towards a closer union between networking & security to improve prevention & secure internet traffic

Software-Defined Infrastructure To Defend Dynamically
A software-centric view of infrastructure enables organizations to more dynamically adapt & adjust their defenses to constantly changing threats
Artificial intelligence be leveraged to automatically insert, change, & remove security points in realtime
Security defenses are moving towards more "point-and-click" deployment capabilities for more rapid protection
Micro Segmentation / Decentralized Networks
To improve security posture, organizations can either build better defenses, have a scattered network, or not have a network at all
Micro segmentation can limit threats from spreading virally if they are able to penetrate a network
Isolation of communication flows enables a more granular workload security control
