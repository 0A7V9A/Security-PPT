So, how do you make this a reality? Our counsel to entrepreneurs

#RSAC
Solve a real problem
"Concentrate on the problem I need to solve, and not on the product or the solution. I want you to demonstrate the business value to my organisation, not just provide a list of technical specifications."
Kelly Isikoff, CISO, AXIS Capital

"Articulate the problem you are solving in as non-technical business terms as you can. Be specific and bring some data to
the table but avoid using generic and irrelevant numbers like "cyber security costs the global economy $1 trillion", or similar."
Lachlan George, Group CISO, Nando's

Balanced teams are crucial
"Be careful when hiring your sales team. Once that burn begins, it is hard to turn down. Hold off hiring
a VP of sales until you as a Founder completely understand the go-to-market strategy." Brian White, Former COO, Red Owl

"The best way for a startup to get my attention is if they come recommended
from a peer or friend. I also value authenticity over anything else; as soon as I question your credibility, you've lost me."
Phil Owen, CISO, Tesco Bank

"Getting in front of CISOs can be hard. Ensure you take part in innovation events at the big
conferences, and take every opportunity to network with security leaders, even if they are not
a direct sales opportunity. Once you have their attention, remember that first impressions
count!" Ollie Whitehouse, CTO, NCC Group
