Obligatory Slide on How to Protect Yourself from

#RSAC

Ransomware

RDP is still by far the primary vector

Patch all the things ­ especially OSes (and quickly!)

Do the thing with the PWs

Monitor your network
­ You will not prevent the intrusion ­ But you can detect the lateral movement

Have a plan (and a backup!)
