Morris Massey's Value Theory
We are not born with our values "preinstalled" Three key formative periods, all early in life
­ Imprint period (<7yo): we are sponges ­ Modeling period (8-13yo): we are copycats ­ Socialization period (13-21yo): we are peer-influenced
What you are is where you were when...

Security & Risk Management Takeaways:

#RSAC

Ubiquity of Technology

Recognize...
­ Technology is ubiquitous in the (personal) lives of your employees ­ Growing up digital :: breathing air
"Obvious" risks are not seen, recognized, or respected as such
­ Where work occurs...is everywhere!
Users (unintentionally, in a rush) often accept the T&Cs
­ Too many apps on mobile devices with too many permissions
Mobile device management (MDM) and jailbreaking

Security & Risk Management Takeaways:

#RSAC

The Dissolving Work/Life Boundary

There is no "light switch" which changes core (security) behaviors between work and home

Beyond the work environment: "crossover areas" of importance

­ Family members on the Internet ­ Connecting to public Wi-Fi access points ­ Social engineering ­ Phishing

­ Shared devices ­ Backup planning ­ Password reuse across accounts ­ Presence on social media sites

Authentication must not occur only at the front door

Security & Risk Management Takeaways:

#RSAC

Social Media

Piggybacking on social media attention-consuming techniques
­ Gamification, #FOMO, mobile-device-centric content

Explicit guidance and training

­ Invitations from strangers

­ Embedded metadata within photos

­ "Quizzes" designed to build out user profiles

­ Imposter accounts

Social media platforms as identity providers
­ Password reuse as a major area of concern

­ Has refused to give information to a business in cases where they felt it was too personal or not necessary
­ Believes anyone who uploads a photo of them to the internet should get their permission first, even if taken in public
­ Believes there should be a law that gives people the right to know all the information websites know about them
­ Believes there should be a law that requires websites to delete all stored information about an individual
@Ben_Smith @RSAsecurity

Security & Risk Management Takeaways:

Privacy

Why aren't younger employees already privacy-aware?
­ They largely are, but... ­ Most programs today focus on online predators and cyberbullying ­ Clear area for improvement: unfounded belief there are legal protections
Extra credit: privacy-centric academic frameworks
­ Look for papers referencing "age cohort"  generational insights

Insider Threats

Three most common types of insider threats
­ IT sabotage, IP theft, fraud

"Identity" is even more complicated than you might think!
­ The joiner-mover-leaver (JML) challenge ­ Accumulation of privileges over time & erosion of access controls ­ Malicious insiders are not only employees

Leveraging Human Resources (HR) as a trigger for monitoring
­ 30 days prior to resignation (look-back) + 30 days post-termination

Reducing Friction to Incent Compliance

Reduce friction at every opportunity
­ If it's too hard, employees (of any age) will find a way to bypass
"Friction" includes back-end personnel and processes
­ Manual processes vs. Automated processes
Have you lost the BYOD battle yet?
Asset management may be an unloved (and under-budgeted) task

Next Steps!
In the next two weeks...
­ Acquire & read Shaw's Sticking Points for generational perspectives (250pp)
In the next three months...
­ Grab one of today's six key messages and "put on the glasses"
Technology ubiquity, the dissolving work/life boundary, social media, privacy, insider threat, and reducing friction to incent compliance
­ Review your security awareness program ­ is there generational skew?
Key areas to review: content, delivery, interactivity, lesson length
­ Take the initiative: find someone not in your generation (a security-focused subordinate or manager) and ask how you can help "translate" up or down
