What do Marriages and Identity Risk Analytics have in #RSAC common?
Most of us have had second thoughts before taking the journey Both require lot more nurturing and learning to succeed

Common friction points in adopting ML-based Identity #RSAC Risk Analytics
Not being able to solve your specific identity needs
No compelling security event that requires intelligent decisions
Do not have the people and process layers to utilize decisions and insights

Top 3 characteristics

Security Policies

· Heavily regulated and compliance is in their DNA
· Lot of business impacting critical data (ex: financial)
· Constantly under attacks

13

Bring your ML-based Identity Risk Analytics vision to life and mature it

· Unified decisions across apps

· Sharing of intelligence · Continuous risk assessment of access patterns

I already have an UEBA solution. How can I extend to ML-based Identity Risk Analytics?

#RSAC
People & Process Support

1 Understand the commonalities
2 Typically UEBA is successful when:  Security/Identity teams interact well  Correlation depth and broader insights  Enough SOC staffing / Automation

· Start with the problem · Define expected outcome · Map the outcome to your problem

3 ML-based Identity Risk Analytics complements when:  Improving User experience  Near real time access decisions  Smarter access controls
15

Define specific use-cases that need to be addressed through ML-based Identity Risk Analytics
Sample Use Cases

#RSAC
ML driven policies

3

Initial Access
· Authentication velocity · Ground speed · Time of access · Looking for type of
device and device statistics

Privileged Escalation
· Looking at peer admin activity
· Application access rate

Lateral Movement
· Correlate ground speed identity
· Understand application access rate
· Device access rate

Techniques

16

Rules are great for protecting your Identities!

Rules Engine

ML-based Identity Risk
Analytics

#RSAC
Rules based policies

 Well defined requirements  Ex: If (IP address = 192.168.x.x)
Then do Y

 Require complex correlation of multiple inputs to make identity decisions
 Need to gain more insights and visibility on user's access patterns
 Ex: If (IP_Type = Office) Then do Y. Office classification is done by the analytics engine
17

ML-based Identity Risk Analytics can complement your Rules

#RSAC
How to take control over classical natural elements?

Data is your 6th classical element. Understand your workforce/data

#RSAC
Technical Success Factors

· Is data generated real-time? · Type of protocols supported by each application

· Types of identities (employees, partners, 3rd
party, consumers) · Geographical distribution of your identities · Mobile versus static endpoints · Data generated by machines versus users

· Number of identities (users, devices, applications) · Attributes of those identities · Traffic generated per identity

20

Understand each ML model constraint to maximize your identity goals

#RSAC
Technical Success Factors

KEY QUESTIONS

· Supervised - Manual or automated feedback

· Alert on Anomaly

· Unsupervised - hidden patterns/groupings 1. Single model vs. multiple mini

· Different options to detect

models

anomalous behavior

2. Learning constraints

3. Updates to models:

How flexible is each model to

updates? How important is it

to your objective?

Anomaly detection

Supervised / Unsupervised

Rule based

· No feedback necessity · Best aligned more towards TTPs · Each rule can use an anomaly
detection model

21

Model interpretability
Visibility into why a user activity is defined as common / uncommon
Ability to explain decisions that can be actionable
Alert on the right things
22

#RSAC
Technical Success Factors

#RSAC
The practice of adaptation ­ Evolve to your environment

How do I adapt the models to my environment?

Functional
Development may be required for meeting specific
technical outcomes

Logical
Have a sandbox environment Behavioral vs. Non-behavioral Volume of data Time to learn

24

#RSAC
Technical Success Factors

Your adaptation lifecycle map
Design
Simulate use-cases and test the model's response
Support and feedback
· Number of alerts handled · Bi-directional data exchange
25

Technical Success Factors
Staging Test
Performance between test and production
Deploy
Stages of user on-boarding / enrollment

Start sharing meaningful data to make your decisions smarter

#RSAC
Technical Success Factors

PRIORITIZE and IMPROVE selective policies/rules

P

based on identity risk analytics insights

R

REMEMBER you have policies/rules in other

I

places in your security stack. START sharing bidirectional insights/alerts

S

M

MANAGE your false positives when using external threat intelligence and insights/alerts from those

systems

What should be my next set of actions?
IAM Admin

Immediate · Inventory the access rules (Authentication, SSO, Authorization) that you manage

3 months 6 months

· Evaluate existing rules against desired security policies · Understanding your workforce behavior and associated data
· Assist in evaluating ML-based Identity Risk Analytics Platform/Provide feedback to teams that are building the inhouse capability

29

#RSAC
What should be my next set of actions?

Immediate

Director - IAM
· Measure whether your access rules are solving or complicating your management and architecture

3 months 6 months

· Define requirements around visibility and insights on identities and evaluate if identity risk analytics is a way to address those requirements
· Consider IAM team people/process to support identity risk analytics program

30

#RSAC
What should be my next set of actions?

Immediate 3 months 6 months

CISO
· Gather recommendations and options on existing capabilities and gaps based on insights developed by the IAM team
· Establish objectives (ex: Do I need to improve my team member experience and end-user productivity through a risk based approach? )
· Make a build vs. buy decision · Remove organizational friction in sharing identity risk
analytics insights across other security teams
