4. Look at the diversity of your own team? How diverse is it really?

#RSAC
"When you are looking for teamwork and problem solving, you need diversity. If you end up with a very homogenous team, they'll become a team really fast but then they'll hit a plateau of ability. And then they'll get stuck in `group think'. They will literally think the same way. You need to have the diversity of gender, sex, race,
of age so that you can problem solve better."
Liz Seward, Senior Space Strategist, Airbus
