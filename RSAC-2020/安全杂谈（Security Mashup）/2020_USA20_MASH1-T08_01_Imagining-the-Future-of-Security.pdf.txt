We are asking the wrong questions
· What's the best tool? · Who should I hire? · Where can I find them? · Should I build stuff on the
Blockchain? AI?

#RSAC
We should instead be asking
· How is world changing? · What trends favor me? · ... my adversary? · Where should I spend my
time & money? · Where should I make my
adversary's spend their time & money?

INTRODUCING FUTURISM

#RSAC
Introducing Futurism
Goes by : Foresight, Futurism, Futurology Futurism is not prediction Both Art and Science Not one future, many possibilities
18

#RSAC
Futurism is a methodological discipline
Helps us
1 Expand the range of future outcomes 2 Identify which factors influence the evolution of the
present into the future and how
3 Understand what decisions and actions in the present might guide us toward desired futures

The Paradigms

Old Security Paradigms

New Security Paradigms

1 Security Plays catch-up.

Security is pro-active.

2 Cat and mouse games.

No more adversaries. (Scenario 9)

3 User is the weakest link. 4 Hard to get funding for security. 5 Human is the (primary) adversary.

User behavior is part of security. User is no longer the weakest link. (Scenario 11)
Infosec is the cost of doing business.
(Scenario 7)
Non-human adversary. (Bot, AI, Machine Intelligence, Quantum cracking)

6 Security doesn't give business benefit. Security is a (business) advantage.

9 Passwords

No more passwords (e.g. ZKP).

10 Defend everything.

Shoot the wounded ­ let weak systems die.

11 Expanding attack surface.

Shrinking attack surface (Scenario 7).

12 Technology attack surface.

Human attack surface (Scenarios 6, 7, 11)

HOMEWORK

#RSAC
Validate or Refute Our Analysis
Read our paper! http://bit.ly/2038security Are the factors complete & correct?
­ Have we missed important factors that influence your security environment?
Are there missing scenarios?
­ Might factors evolve in ways we've not identified? ­ What would the future look like if this happened?
What else might be disrupted?
­ What are we (as an industry) assuming is constant that might change suddenly?

#RSAC
Apply, Plan, and Track the Factors
Contextualize your security product, service, or program
­ Which factors is your product/service/program sensitive to?
For each of these factors, what changes in the factor's trend line make your p/s/p more effective? Which make it less effective?
­ Are you tracking the relevant factors?
If your p/s/p is sensitive to the evolution of a factor's trend line, are you tracking the evolution of the factor?
­ Can/does your p/s/p affect the evolution of a factor's trend line?
How much effort are you spending to do this?
­ What factor trend lines do you control? ­ What factor trend lines does the adversary control? ­ What factor trend lines are driven by broader social/economic/tech factors?

#RSAC
Do Your Own Analysis
Our study is broad and incomplete
­ The results are interesting enough that we think more in-depth application of futurist methodology to security is warranted
­ If you think so to, you can move the ball forward
Pick one or two futurist methods to try & directly apply to your product, service, or program Apply futurist interview protocols in your research & marketing process Engage a futurist to do an analysis of the future of your specific security market sector, product, service, or program
There are many futurist techniques we've not yet applied to security
­ Causal Layer Analysis, Delphi, Futures Wheel, Systems Architypes, + lots more! ­ Get in touch if you'd like to learn more!
