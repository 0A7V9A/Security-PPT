Summary

ENTERPRISES
 Make confirmation bias your last resort
 Use inquiries, ask for analyst by name
 "What has worked for others like me?"
 Much is useful, nothing is magic or tsunami-ish

VENDORS
 Build great products, incent users to rate you with analysts
 Ask how many user inquires per week the analyst does.
 "Do you think users need this feature/enhancement"
 Vendor briefings are free ­ don't waste their time, though.

Key Take-ways to Apply When You Get Back to Work ­ #RSAC Enterprise Users
If your company has an analyst service, find out how to use it ­ especially the inquiry and contract review services. What area could knowledge of what has worked for others help you? Are you looking for analysis, validation or advice? Pick the right analyst. Look for freebies nearing contract renewal.

Key Take-ways to Apply When You Get Back to Work - #RSAC Vendors
Any position in a market document is better than not appearing at all.
A good vendor briefing is free and more effective than expensive "capture the analyst for a day" sessions.
Use the analyst firms mostly to learn what they are hearing, not what they think.
Pick the right analyst.
Moderated user input sessions are hugely valuable.
