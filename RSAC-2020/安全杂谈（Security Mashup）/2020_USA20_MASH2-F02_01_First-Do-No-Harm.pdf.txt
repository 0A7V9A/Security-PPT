Some Caveats ...
Technology can be an incredible power for good
­ ...but with great power comes great responsibility
Perfect isn't achievable
­ ...but "better" almost always is
The only constant in life is change
­ ...and that happens whether we like it or not
Never underestimate the power of one person to change the world

The Great Myth

#RSAC
Impact of Technology
Positive and negatives to almost everything Connectedness Shortened attention spans Far more information, and the ability to harness information Greatly reduced privacy Risks many of us don't see and can't understand Have many of us ever considered the pluses and minuses of technology?

Scenario 1: Connected Cars
Connected cars have already been hacked
­ "All code has defects; some are significant" ­ No, ML and AI won't make this all work
Testing mechanical devices is straightforward
­ ...testing code is far more complex
Inability to maintain code for the life of the vehicle
­ ...means far more mechanical waste
The appeal of "break once; hack many" Confluence of technologies may empower precise targeting
­ Or massive disruption

Scenario 2: The Internet-Enabled Refrigerator
What actual problem does this solve? Who else can see if you are out of eggs? Why does my kitchen need a firewall? Why is my refrigerator now part of a botnet? Can the software be maintained for the life of the refrigerator? In general, many mechanical devices do not need Internet connectivity and do not profit by them

Scenario 3: The Nuclear Reactor
Traditionally, access limited to selected, well-vetted people
­ Enforced by guns, gates, guards ­ Physical access required to control reactor ­ Result: limited, well understood, controlled risk
"Connected access" may exponentially increase risk
­ Result: If you get it wrong, risk cannot be acceptably mitigated

Is `More Technology' Necessarily The Answer?
9

#RSAC
Consider the Medical Profession
The Hippocratic Oath: First Do No Harm Informed consent, including for clinical trials Extensive drug and device testing Understanding of side effects of treatments and medication Risk vs. reward calculation
10

#RSAC
Consider the Technology "Profession"
"More technology will solve technology-induced problems" Insufficient/uninformed consent Inconsistent testing Insufficient understanding of side effects Reward often trumps risk; systemic risk ignored

#RSAC
What Should We Do?

#RSAC
Question the Potential Impact of Technology
Does this (technology) solve a problem people care about?
­ "OMG, like, we need, like, an app to share TPPs with BFFs!"
Does this potential technology solve a problem better, cheaper or faster than current options?
­ If not, why are we using it?
Does this technology create externalities? Is the long-term total cost greater than the benefits? Does this technology create systemic risk?
14

#RSAC
Broader Mechanisms for Change
Improve educational systems (especially STEM programs)
­ Ethical considerations of technology must become part of curricula ­ Technology is ephemeral; ethical norms much less so ­ Example: Humanities division within the University of Virginia School of
Engineering and Applied Science
Industry and professional associations should develop a professional code of ethics Industry conferences should incorporate "ethics" tracks If we don't start talking about ethical/acceptable uses of technology, nothing will ever change
15

#RSAC
What Can One Person Do?
"Let Your `Yes' be `Yes' and Your `No' be `No'" Learn to explain technological concerns in layman's language
­ Incorporate economics, analogies, humor, popular cultural references...whatever works to make your point
­ My favorite: The Little Dutch Boy
Enlist allies
­ Legal, human resources, privacy mavens, ethics and compliance hotlines...
Build a community of ethically-aware technologists...and technology-aware ethicists

Summary

#RSAC
Don't Be This Guy
18

#RSAC
Conclusions
Technology-induced problems cannot (necessarily) be solved by more technology
­ By definition, systemic risk must be avoided
We can only successfully use technology if we are honest about potential risks and "pernicious uses" Discussions of ethics in technology must become the norm Each of us can and should be a force for good in the universe "First, Do No Harm"
