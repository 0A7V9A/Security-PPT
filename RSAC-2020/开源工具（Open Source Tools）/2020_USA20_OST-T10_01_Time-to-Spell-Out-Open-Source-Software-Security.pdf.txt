Speed of DevOps
Software is being released quicker then ever: 43% of developers' organizations deploy code continuously, and 41% deploy between once a day and once a month
Current Security implementations don't work: 50% of developers' organizations agree security vulnerabilities are most discovered by security team after code is merged in a test environment, and 49% encounter most delays in the testing phase of lifecycle.
Finding flaws is easy, fixing them is hard: When examining the top forty computer science programs in the United States, Forrester found that zero of the forty schools require a class about secure coding or secure application design.

How do I translate this to my organization
1. Create and enforce security policies 2. Understand what open source libraries are being used and where the
vulnerabilities are 3. Update vulnerable libraries 4. Engage your developers
