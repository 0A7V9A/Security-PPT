Taking this forward ("how to apply")
This week:
­ Think about the security problems you're trying to solve ­ chances are good the tools in this track can help with at least some of them
Next week:
­ Engage with your firm's open source management program (if there is one), or ­ Consider championing one (build consensus, find like-minded allies) if it doesn't already exist
Next month:
­ Keep an eye open for internal efforts that you may be "sitting on" that can help others (benefits to you include free marketing, low-cost support/improvements to tools you're using anyway)
Next year:
­ Consider submitting your projects/software/experiences to this forum (or others like it)
