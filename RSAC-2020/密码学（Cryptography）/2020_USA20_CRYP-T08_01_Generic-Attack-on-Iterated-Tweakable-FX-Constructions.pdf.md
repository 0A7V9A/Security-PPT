Informa on Theore c Key Recovery
It's all about the query complexity. We count calls to tweakable block cipher ~Ek(и, и) and block ciphers E1(и, и), E2(и, и). Computa on of subkey func ons are not counted. GOAL: Recover the master key k.

Our Strategy
We follow the same strategy as [Gazi, 2013] to improve and apply it in the tweakable block cipher se ng.
Strategy
Build a contradictory path for each wrong key guesses un l one is le .
14

#RSAC
Contradictory Path
1. Query c = ~Ek(t, m) for some (t, m). 2. Make a guess k of the master key k. 3. Compute c = ~Ek(t, m). 4. If c = c then Contradictory Path then k = k.

Coun ng queries
и No issue with guessing all the keys in informa on theore c se ng. и However we can't make a block cipher query for each guess, it's too much ! и We need to store and reuse previous queries as much as we can.
Tweakable Block Cipher
As we can have security  2n we also can have online queries  2n !
