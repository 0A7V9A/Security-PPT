People's Rights
Be informed of what will be done with their data

Have a copy of it if requested
­ And in a structured format
Fix errors Erasure (the right to be forgotten) Stop certain types of processing

Organization's Obligations
Be accountable Protection by design and default Manage third-parties Document processing activities Keep data secure Breach notification Impact assessments Don't send data to unsafe countries

#RSAC
Article 5(1)(f): the security principle
Personal Data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (`integrity and confidentiality').
12

#RSAC
Article 32(1) ­ the security obligation
Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk ...

#RSAC
Penalties ...
Article 83(9)
... the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

Details

British Airways

Negligence (probably)

Regulator When Amount Why Details

United Kingdom
Not yet ...
220 million (£187 million) = 1.5% turnover
Inappropriate security
Criminals installed web skimming (Magecart) on the BA website and took payment card data. Subsequent forensic analysis discovered widespread data compromise. It has been reported that BA was not compliant with PCI DSS at the time of the incident.

Marriott Hotels

Negligence

Regulator When Amount Why Details

United Kingdom Not yet ... 118 million Inappropriate security In the course of the acquisition of Starwood (2016), insufficient due diligence was done (it seems Starwoord's systems were compromised in 2014 by HNS actors who were still active in 2018 at the time of the merger).

32

#RSAC
What can we determine
There isn't yet any consistency of penalties Generally, more penalties have been for violations of principles:
­ No legal basis for processing ­ Processing beyond the reason the data was collected ­ Retaining data for far too long
The security breaches are obvious and clear
­ Unarguable that there was a breach ­ Size of the penalty hard to determine
There isn't good experience yet of when a security breach is principles rather than obligations

Case Study

#RSAC
Work in your tables
IT want to decommission unsupported (unpatchable) SharePoint and the underlying server OS by migrating to cloud-based O365 A SharePoint site contains c500K poorly indexed HR documents
­ Scans of every type of employee-related document you can think of: ­ Held way beyond retention policy (agreed with workers' councils)
potentially contravening other employment laws ­ Much of the data relates to ex-employees
Although O365 is linked to Active Directory, only single factor authentication (username / password) is currently supported.
35

#RSAC
Who wants what?
IT want to migrate all data to O365 as soon as possible
­ They argue that O365 is much more secure than the internal systems and they can't guarantee the security of the system
Information Security want to wait for six months until MFA is implemented
­ Which also has the advantage that some 25% of records will have been deleted (HR predict 2 years for full data deletion)
The Data Protection Officer wants all data past retention to be deleted before migration ­ ie wait two years
36

#RSAC
Wrap-up

#RSAC
What should you do?
Work out your organization's risk appetite and tolerance
­ And how comfortable you are with second guessing the regulators' view of what's appropriate
Document where you're aiming for Read decisions from the 27/28 regulators as they are published Did anything surprise you?
­ Also good to document
