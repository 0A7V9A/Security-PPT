Why do we need to measure human-centric risk?

You can't change what you can't see

#RSAC
Are your interventions working?

What does you need to focus on?

Why we measure
· For the same reasons we measure anything else: To know what it is To know how it works To know how to manage it
· Measurement allows us to know if security is effective. · Appropriately prioritize our resources · Measurement shows us the impact of security decisions · Measurement helps us communicate to others · Understand our security strengths and weaknesses
