Frame Our Topic
Let's talk about attribution

#RSAC
What Attribution Can Feel Like
5

#RSAC
What is Attribution?
· Associating adversary activity with something else · Many different definitions  confusion
6

#RSAC
What are Different Types of Attribution?
· We can attribute to...

The "who"
­ A person ­ A team or unit ­ An organization ­ A government

The "how"
­ Tools/malware ­ Other code ­ Tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) ­ Infrastructure

7

#RSAC
How Do We Perform Attribution?
· Find patterns and connections · Look for human fingerprints
­ Personas, email addresses, passwords
· Use operational security failures by adversaries
­ Reusing account names (e.g. UglyGorilla) or infrastructure
· Leverage different sources depending on collection
­ HUMINT (human sources) ­ SIGINT (intercepted communications) ­ OSINT (news stories, WhoIs, Passive DNS, malware research)

#RSAC
Different Methods of Attribution
· Associate what you find with someone else's research · Create your own clusters

­ Making business decisions ­ Using instruments of power
· Diplomatic, Informational, Military, Economic
· Sometimes it matters less
