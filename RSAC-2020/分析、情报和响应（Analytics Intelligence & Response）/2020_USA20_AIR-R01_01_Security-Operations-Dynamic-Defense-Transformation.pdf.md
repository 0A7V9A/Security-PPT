WHY NOW & FRAMEWORK

So Why Now?
EXPONENTIALLY GROWING ATTACK SURFACE
The attack surface has expanded to third-party integrations, which was the primary attack vector for LabCorp

MASSIVE RESOURCE GAPS
Finding individuals versed in perimeter-less engineering and
cybersecurity, is increasingly challenging

#RSAC
INCREASED REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT
Prescriptive government action, growing public scrutiny, and farther-
reaching consequences

ORGANIZATIONS ARE SLOW TO MIGRATE TO THREAT-CENTRIC
OPERATIONS
Slow adoption of automation and integration of threat intel

ADVERSARY SOPHISTICATION IS OUTPACING CYBER DEFENSE
Limited enterprise-wide visibility of cyber threats combined with alert
overload and fatigue

TOOLS ALONE WON'T MODERNIZE OPERATIONS AND
STOP CYBER THREATS
While many organizations have adopted various tools, data integration gaps and tuning deficiencies open windows for
adversaries to attack undetected

Threat Actors & TTPs

The Hacktivist
The Criminal
The NationState Agent

Today's Adversaries...
· Target weaknesses in the traditional SOC model
· Can avoid most prevention controls
· Can probe for months, avoiding triggers for threshold-based alerts
· Target the weakest link across an expanded attack surface (e.g., Cloud and OT)
· Can develop amazing levels of intelligence

Design Principles for Proactive Cyber Defense
· Program is routinely evaluated, and performance metrics used to ensure controls are operating as intended

INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN

3 PROACTIVE
CONTINUOUS
4 TESTING &
EVALUATION

· Organizations consume and produce threat intelligence to enrich case work, direct investigations, gain context on suspicious activity and develop a sophisticated understanding and track specific threats
· Efforts geared towards detecting and hunting for threats and enabling prevention of tactics and attack methods (TTPs), in addition to prevention of discrete indicators (IOCs)
· Threat defenders and red team attackers continuously hunt for exploitable weaknesses and immediately deploy mitigating controls or process improvements to close gaps

INTEGRATED, AUTOMATED, &
5 MACHINE-
ENABLED

· Traditional IT and new security functions integrated into an agile, consolidated, and cohesive organization empowered by workflow automation and orchestration tools to rapidly respond and contain threats while managing risks
· Organizations leverage emerging technologies, including advanced analytics, machine intelligence and learning, and workflow automation/ orchestration tools

1 Continuous Improvement
Program Evaluations
­ Routinely evaluate your Cyber Ops capabilities to ensure you understand current state and deficiencies
­ Get back to basics ­ Take a threat-centric approach to transform your
organization beyond compliance
Program Performance Measures
­ Track the effectiveness of your controls and capabilities
­ Leverage both lead and lag indicators to provide insights over a period and quickly determine program impact
