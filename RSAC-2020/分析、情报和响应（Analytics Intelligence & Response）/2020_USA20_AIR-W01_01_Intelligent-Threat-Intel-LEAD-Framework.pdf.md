LEAD CTI Framework Key Takeaways

"Apply"

AIR-W01

Next week you should:
­ Create Threat Profile and understand from whom and what you are trying to defend.
­ Promote CTI within your organization and find new stakeholders.
In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Set Threat Intel Program Requirements and use LEAD maturity model to understand where you stand.
­ Try to make sense of your CTI data by applying scoring and categorization ­ Use Security Orchestration and Machine Learning to get the best of CTI ­ Use the results to create metrics that will justify and add value to your CTI
