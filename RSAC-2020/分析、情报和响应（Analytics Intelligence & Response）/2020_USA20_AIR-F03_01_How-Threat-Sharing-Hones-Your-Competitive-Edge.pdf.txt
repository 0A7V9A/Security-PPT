Typical reasons given for why cyber companies should share threat intelligence...
It's for the greater good It's the solution for our cybersecurity problems The bad guys do it all the time, so the good guys should too Sharing is caring

What usually happens in reality:

#RSAC
*Chirp*

IT TURNS OUT THREAT SHARING IS EASY TO TALK ABOUT, BUT HARD TO DO
Even harder to do consistently at high quality and large scale
Really, really hard in the face of competitive pressures

It's makes you WannaCry....
CTA'S SHARING ACTIVITIES AROUND WANNACRY MADE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY BETTER OFF, BUT ALSO DIRECTLY HELPED OUR MEMBERS

What makes threat sharing so hard?

Technical
Data volume, speed, and diversity pose problems

Legal
Parameters for acceptable sharing can be unclear

Five factors inhibit threat sharing:

Economic
Hard to measure the ROI for sharing
Cultural
Sharing undercuts my business model

Conceptual
Threat sharing means different things to different people

#RSAC

But we can overcome these barriers

Technical
Technical standards now exist Big data analytics common

Economic
Case studies show the benefits of sharing

Ways to move past

Legal
US & EU have legal frameworks Sharing organizations exist

the inhibitions:

Cultural
It's not what you know, but what you do with what you know

Conceptual
Different organizations share different information

How Does Threat Sharing Enhance Your Competitive Edge?

Cybersecurity is not just a technical problem

Increased security comes from taking action

End-users are demanding a team approach

No organization has expertise in all the facets
of cybersecurity.

It's not what you know, but what you do with
what you know.

Comparative advantage should drive what organizations do.

#RSAC
How Does Threat Sharing Enhance Your Competitive Edge?

No single company sees all malicious activity
Every organization can learn something from
sharing.

Regular sharing generates connections and ideas
Sharing forces you to defend your conclusions.

Exchanging business cards in a crisis is a bad idea
It builds the connections needed to
deal with crises.

#RSAC
Honing your threat sharing skills
Effective threat sharing requires answering three questions:  Who is sharing?  What information are they sharing?  What purpose are they sharing it for?
The answers to these questions enable you to derive and identify the value you receive from sharing by:
 Focusing on relevant information  Aligning sharing goals with business needs  Tracking useful metrics to improve performance over time
10

#RSAC
Focusing your sharing efforts

Eight types of relevant information:
 Technical data  Context  Attribution  Situational Awareness  Strategic warning  Tactical warning  Best practices  Defensive measures and mitigations

Five types of organizations:
1. Cybersecurity providers, platform providers, ISPs 2. Information sharing organizations 3. Large companies and organizations 4. National government agencies 5. Local government agencies, small and medium
businesses, and individuals

Case Studies & Lessons Learned from the Cyber Threat Alliance

#RSAC
Threat Sharing Examples from CTA
Automated sharing enhances outputs All our members receive information that was new to them
WannaCry threat sharing reduced the "fog of war" We got to the right answer much more quickly
VPNFilter threat sharing amplified our actions Coordinated protections boosted impact
13

#RSAC
Threat Sharing Examples from CTA
Early sharing fill in gaps and enhance defenses Our members can put protections in place ahead of public release
Working Groups focus threat sharing on particular events or threats We can use shared information to better disrupt malicious activity
Bluekeep threat sharing sped up defensive measures Customers were protected more quickly

#RSAC
Lessons from our sharing experience
 Something is better than nothing ­ Do not have to share everything for sharing to be useful
 Automation is important for technical sharing ­ Need speed and scale
 Humans are important too ­ People have to do something with the information
 Sharing is hard work ­ The technical parts are difficult, but the non-technical parts are more difficult
15

#RSAC
Applying these lessons in the real world

#RSAC
Applying these lessons at the organizational level
 If your organization produces, collects, or provides threat intelligence:
­ Analyze what you can share and what you could benefit from receiving ­ Join a formal threat sharing organization ­ Automate the technical intelligence sharing
 If your organization consumes threat intelligence:
­ Ask your vendors how they share threat intelligence across the industry ­ Ask your vendors to validate the intelligence they share with you ­ Make threat sharing an evaluation criterion in your cybersecurity contracts
17

#RSAC
Applying these lessons at the organizational level
 If your organization shares threat intelligence amongst members:
­ Update your business rules to encourage sharing ­ Focus on information types that fit your comparative advantage ­ Build relationships with other threat sharing organizations across sectors
and geographic regions
 If your organization is a national government agency: ­ Articulate priorities clearly ­ Focus sharing with the private sector on your comparative advantage (hint: it's not technical data) ­ Encourage cross-sector and international sharing
18

#RSAC
Applying these lessons across the ecosystem
 Translate sharing into action
­ Identify specific actions for different parts of the ecosystem to take ­ Identify real/perceived barriers to action ­ Collaborate to systemically disrupt adversaries
 Ensure policy and law supports sharing and collaboration activities ­ Eliminate real or perceived barriers to sharing and collaboration ­ Create positive incentives for sharing and collaboration ­ Mitigate unintended consequences
