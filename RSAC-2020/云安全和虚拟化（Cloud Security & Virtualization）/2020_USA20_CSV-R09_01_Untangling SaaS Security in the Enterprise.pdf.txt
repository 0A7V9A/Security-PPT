Foundational Cloud Security Controls - Takeaways

Identity & Access Management
 Formalize standards and process for AuthN/AuthZ with SaaS services. [SCIM, SAML, Oauth, OpenID]
 Enable MFA ­ Send MFA status as an attribute when using federated Auth.
 Privileged Identities ­ Vaulted, should use MFA always.

Data Protection
 Data Classification, Data Lifecycle, Data Location/Residency
 Encryption Engine ­ Provider Managed Encryption, Proxy Encryption
 Key management ­ Customer managed, Provider Managed. ­ Have control of the key all the time.
