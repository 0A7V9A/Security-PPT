Unhackable!
This bounty program is not intended to help Bitfi to identify security vulnerabilities since we already claim that our security is absolute

Unhackable!
"Bitfi is unhackable"
=
Bitfi is not vulnerable to one very specific attack

Advice
Don't ever claim a product is unhackable Select your base hardware carefully TEE, entropy source, secure storage, lockable bootloader, no CRP bypass, toolchain access etc Get firmware & software developed by devs who can demonstrate really good security expertise (e.g. OWASP, good SDLC etc) Get third party advice REALLY early on, before you...
62

Advice
DO Set up a bug bounty programme
DON'T Rely on it as your only source of security evaluation - No substitute for SDLC, pen testing, hardware security review
