Crown Jewels Analysis
MITRE has defined crown jewels analysis as "a process for identifying those cyber assets that are most critical to the accomplishment of an organization's mission".

#RSAC
MITRE Threat Table ­ 5 threat levels

Threat Level Typical Actors
1: Unsophisticated Hackers, Taggers, and "Script Kiddies;" small disaffected
groups of the above.

2: Limited

Individuals or small, loosely affiliated groups; political or ideological activists; terrorists; domestic insiders; industrial espionage; spammers.

Typical Goals
· Disrupt and/or embarrass the victimized organization or type of organization
· (e.g. a specific Department or the Federal government as a whole).
· Obtain critical information and/or usurp or disrupt the organization's business or mission functions for profit or ideological cause.

3: Moderate 4: Significant 5: Advanced

Nation-state government entity; patriotic hacker group; sophisticated terrorist group; professional organized criminal enterprise.
Professional intelligence organization or military service operative.
Nation-state military possibly supported by their intelligence service; very sophisticated and capable insurgent or terrorist group.

· Increase knowledge of general infrastructure; · Plant seeds for future attacks; · Obtain or modify specific information and/or disrupt cyber resources,
specifically resources associated with missions or even information types.
· Obtain specific, high value information; · Undermine or impede critical aspects of a mission, program, or
enterprise; · Place itself in a position to do so in the future.
· Severely undermine or destroy an organization's mission capabilities by disrupting or denying its use of cyber resources
· (e.g. information, ICT infrastructure and applications).

#RSAC
MITRE ATT&CK Model
Created out of a need to systematically categorize adversary behavior. The basis of ATT&CK is the set of individual techniques that represent actions that adversaries can perform to accomplish objectives. Those objectives are represented by the tactic categories the techniques fall under. This representation balances technical detail at the technique level and the context around why actions occur at the tactic level. The relationship between tactics and techniques can be visualized in the ATT&CK Matrix.
Adoption of ATT&CK can be useful to support intrusion detection, threat hunting, security engineering and threat intelligence

Cyber-worthiness is a metaphor for the way ships and aircraft #RSAC are assessed as platforms in hostile environments

Assessment of the suitability of a network and the way it is configured for the threat environment
Considers the environmental and external conditions the system must be capable of operating within

Cyber -worthiness

Considers inherent security capabilities and resilience of the system
Addresses the conditions of the surrounding ecosystem and the impact of compromise both on the system or platform

Extends beyond immediate impact to look at the broader second-order effects at an organizational or mission level

Is intended to complement and inform existing views of risk

Cyber-worthiness seeks to move beyond compliance whilst retaining an engineering aspect

Why Gaming?

#RSAC
Why Gaming?
Strategic planning for cyber security is rare and gaming offers an opportunity to consider key aspects Gaming provides an opportunity to practice a rigorous process for cyber security planning Allows users to adopt an adversarial mindset in a safe environment
tsProtect has been designed as an interactive method of engaging players in developing a cyber-security strategy

6 phases to a move
Threat bot responds at the end of each move
Constant feedback via video

tsProtect is designed to allow the player to focus on strategy development instead of tables and dice

25

The Communications Hub is where key stakeholders will #RSAC communicate with you throughout the game
When you play a card you'll get feedback and when events happen you'll be notified through the Communications Hub. You will need to scan the QR code on the back of each card to play it and confirm on the touch screen to play the card.
26

#RSAC
Budget ­ the reason you can't buy everything
The budget shows how much money you've got left to spend per move. Each move you'll get a resupply of more money - but it won't always be the same amount. Part of your strategy is to prioritize spending. The timer will count down and the move ends if it runs out. There are 4 moves. The current move number is displayed on the board.
27

#RSAC
Scores are one way of measuring your success
A key part of the game is increasing your overall security posture, indicated by a security score. However, some security controls will reduce your system usability. If the usability score gets too low, there will be an effect on your network. There are other scores at work in the game but these are not visible to the player.
28

#RSAC
The Board
Each table has its own board and will play individual games against threat bot adversaries

#RSAC
Quick Reference Guides and Player Handbooks
Quick reference guide cards and a player handbook have been developed as support materials to assist players throughout the game
33

#RSAC
Example Threat Brief
A threat brief has been provided for each of the APTs utilized in tsProtect
The RSA instance of tsProtect has a single APT running within the threat bot
If you can identify the correct APT the threat bot will be at a disadvantage
It is important to align the security controls you play against the TTPs employed by the APT
The best way to ensure victory is to play security controls that will defeat the threat bot
34

#RSAC
Threat Bot explanation and usage
Bots replicate behaviors of the adversary and apply consistent behaviors to teach key outcomes. Bots go through their own procedure, in accordance with their TTPs:
­ Recon ­ target scanning and scoping ­ Weaponisation ­ Exploit development, method selection ­ Delivery ­ Payload delivery ­ Exploit ­ True/False ­ Control ­ Overcome prevention strategies ­ Escalate ­ Spread and pivot ­ Mission Execution ­ Complete assigned tasks/ fulfill intent
Threat Bots can be defeated ­ they will behave in a specific way

tsProtect - How to Win the Game!
· If you can identify your crown jewels correctly, this will harden the appropriate areas of your network
· If you correctly identify your APT, this will make your security control selection more effective against their attacks
· If you can select the correct security controls to defend against your attacker, this will prevent your network from being compromised and owned
If you are still operating your network at the end of the 4 moves, you win!

Summary and Wrap-up

Now that you may or may not have defeated your adversary #RSAC playing tsProtect ­ here's a summary of what we did...
Presented tsProtect +
Used 6-step Model =
Learned to use security controls against specific threats
Well done everyone!
49

Here's how to apply what you have learned today when #RSAC you walk out of the door
Next week you should:
­ Review the 6-step method presented here today and think about developing your own cybersecurity strategy or supplementing an existing strategy with a threat-based view
In the first three months following this learning lab you should:
­ Seek to wargame or play through an attack on your organization, using the method described ­ Capture lessons learnt and seek to integrate them into existing policies and/or strategies
Within six months you should:
­ Build a threat library of potential threat actors and their TTPs ­ Develop your own method of regularly gaming attacks on your organization using a threat library
to focus effort; then use these results to inform your strategy
Thank you for your participation!
