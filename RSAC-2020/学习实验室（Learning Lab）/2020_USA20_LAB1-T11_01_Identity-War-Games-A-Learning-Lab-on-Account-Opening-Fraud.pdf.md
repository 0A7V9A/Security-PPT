Summary
Call the Dead Guy
KYC controls look for many correlations and try matching many factors, but sometimes the data is biased, faulty, not up to date ­ or the user just makes a mistake Using next-gen data sources that don't actually use the data itself can provide a `second opinion' that clears applications, leading to higher acquisition rates

Defying the Laws of Physics

Having multiple layers of visibility is key
Social media analysis can provide negative and positive clues, but may be difficult to fully automate and easy to get into a rabbit hole if you're not careful.

Summary

#RSAC

Saving the sea turtles

The bigger the transaction, the higher the risk, but also the higher the reward. This could have easily been a real case of a huge, unusual order
Which is why just transactional data is insufficient. It takes many layers of analysis to make an informed decision
