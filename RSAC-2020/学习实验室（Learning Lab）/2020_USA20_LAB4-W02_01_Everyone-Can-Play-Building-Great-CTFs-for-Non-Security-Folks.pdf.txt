Multimodal Learning Through Media: What the Research Says

https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/industries/docs/education/Multimodal-Learning-Through-Media.pdf @jkuemerle

1. Multimedia Principle: Retention is improved through
words and pictures rather than through words alone.
2. Spatial Contiguity Principle: Students learn better
when corresponding words and pictures are presented near each other rather than far from each other on the page or screen.
3. Temporal Contiguity Principle: Students learn
better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively.
4. Coherence Principle: Students learn better when
extraneous words, pictures, and sounds are excluded rather than included.
5. Modality Principle: Students learn better from
animation and narration than from animation and on-screen text.
6. Redundancy Principle: Students learn better when
information is not represented in more than one modality ­ redundancy interferes with learning.
7a. Individual Differences Principle: Design effects
are higher for low-knowledge learners than for highknowledge learners.
7b. Individual Differences Principle: Design effects
are higher for high-spatial learners rather than for low-spatial learners.
8. Direct Manipulation Principle: As the complexity of the materials increase, the impact of
direct manipulation of the learning materials
(animation, pacing) on transfer also increases

#RSAC
 Relevancy - challenges should use the same technologies and platforms that the participants work in
 Appropriateness - challenges should cover vulnerability categories that are known to exist in the participants codebases
 Interesting/Engaging - challenges should draw the participants attention and encourage them to find solutions
 Solvable - challenges should have a clear and accurate solution
 Reflective - challenges should reinforce targeted concepts

#RSAC
Red Flags - Avoid · Excessive Obscurity - solutions should be discoverable (with a
reasonable amount of effort)
· Non-Relevant - work to solve challenges should not be far outside of the participants skill set and work requirements
· Open Ended - challenges should be have enough guidance to allow the participant to find an agreed upon "good" solution

#RSAC
· Next week you should:
­ Identify teams that will benefit from CTF style training ­ Identify SMEs to build a pilot CTF
· In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Have run a CTF and iterated on the design, challenges and goals ­ Run retrospectives of both CTF builders and CTF players ­ Gathered usage data into a repository
· Within six months you should:
­ Have an active, ongoing CTF based training program ­ Run regular retrospectives and incorporate feedback ­ Report KPIs and regularly survey program effectiveness
