THE REALITY

#RSAC

LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES

Legacy systems, non-traditional
endpoints, IoT, BYOD

Network traffic and various perimeters

Vendors, outsourced IT and services, 3rd party connections

Limited security budgets / staffing
/ skills

Log information and maintenance

One of the more demanding problems to implementing new smart technologies is managing what is currently in place.

THE REALITY
COMMUNITIES, HOSPITALS, UNIVERSITIES - perfect targets for Cybercrime
 Legacy network debt plus new smart technologies results in unforeseen infrastructure complications

#RSAC

 Increased complexity

 Cascading effect
 Patch deployments
 Lack of threat models
 New attack surfaces

#RSAC
MOVING FORWARD

· Security Standards & Governance
· Provide critical services should be subject to federal/state security baseline
· Frameworks and Guidance
· Baseline security standards developed for acceptable level of security · Not every organization needs same level due to size, complexity,
operations, data etc.
· Funding & Grant Opportunities
· Organizations typically state their security debt is due to lack of funding · US Federal or US Dept of Homeland Security initiatives · Partnerships with Private Industry (Incubators, Start-Ups, Vendors)
