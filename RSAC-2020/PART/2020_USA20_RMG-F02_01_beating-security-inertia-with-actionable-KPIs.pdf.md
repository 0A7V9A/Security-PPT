KPI Framework
· My goal is to _____ <business goal> · I will measure ____ <KPI> · My audience is ____ <target audience> · I will communicate every ____ <frequency> · I expect the audience to ____ <expected action>

KPI Example #1 - Laptop Hardening
· My goal is to minimize risk from user endpoint compromise · I will measure patch latency · My audience is CIO · I will communicate every month · I expect the audience to drive patch latency to under 2 weeks

3 Categories of KPIs

#RSAC
Categories of KPIs
Organization
Company wide / security program level KPIs
Team
KPIs for each team / department
Individual
Specific to an individual
20

#RSAC
Individual KPIs - Drive Behavior Change
 Must be actionable  Easy to complete  Set against a goal  Should evoke an emotion - Achievement,
Altruism, Social Standing, Competition etc
21

#RSAC
Individual KPIs - Examples

 Phishing & Training  Phishing test failure rate  Training completion status
 Secure Behavior  # of malicious sites visited  # of DLP alerts triggered  # of passwords shared in clear text

 Endpoint Security  # of Vulnerable applications installed  Configuration compliance status  OS Patch Status
 Secure Coding  # of vulnerabilities in pull requests

23

#RSAC
Team KPIs - Prioritize Security
KPIs for security responsibilities of a team / department · Align with strategic objectives · Set goals (e.g. quarterly)
­ Top down driven targets ­ Gamification for bottoms up growth · Communicate frequently & positively · Leading & lagging indicators
24

#RSAC
Team KPIs - Example KPI
Strategic Objective: Resolve at least 80% of vulnerabilities within SLA
KPI: % of vulnerabilities resolved within SLA

# of vulnerabilities due in next 2 weeks Supporting Metric

% of vulnerabilities `Not Started' Supporting Metric

Additional Supporting Metrics  # of unresolved overdue vulnerabilities  vulnerability backlog trend

 % of time budgeted for security work  % of team members with security training
25

#RSAC
Organizational KPIs - Measure Performance
Measure company wide risk management goals · Aid in decision making and planning · Customize for your leadership team · Simple to understand, not dumbed down
26

#RSAC
Organizational KPIs - Examples

Security Baseline Coverage · % of endpoints meeting config baseline (e.g CIS) · % of endpoints under active defense (e.g. EDR)
Bonus: Group by Endpoint Type / OS / Team / Geo

Patch Latency · % of laptops with critical patches missing · % of endpoints with patch latency > 90d
Bonus: Group by OS / Missing Patch / Team / Geo

Vulnerability Management · Created vs Resolved · % of Vulnerabilities Resolved In SLA Bonus: Analyze by Team / Product / Asset Category

Detection & Response · Mean Time To Detect · Mean Time To Respond Bonus: Analyze by Severity / Asset Class / Environment
