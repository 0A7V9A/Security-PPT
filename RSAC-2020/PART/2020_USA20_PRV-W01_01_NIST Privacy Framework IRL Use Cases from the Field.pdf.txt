Relationship Between Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk

Cybersecurity

Risks

cyber

associated with cybersecurity incidents
arising from loss of confidentiality, integrity,

securityrelated privacy events

or availability

Privacy Risks
associated with privacy events arising from data
processing

Data: A representation of information, including digital and non-digital formats
Privacy Event: The occurrence or potential occurrence of problematic data actions
Data Processing: The collective set of data actions (i.e., the complete data life cycle, including, but not limited to collection, retention, logging, generation, transformation, use, disclosure, sharing, transmission, and disposal)
Privacy Risk: The likelihood that individuals will experience problems resulting from data processing, and the impact should they occur

Privacy Risk and Organizational Risk

Problem
arises from data processing

Individual
experiences direct impact
(e.g., embarrassment, discrimination, economic
loss)
4

Organization
resulting impact
(e.g., customer abandonment, noncompliance costs, harm to reputation or internal culture)

#RSAC
Privacy Framework Structure
The Core provides an increasingly granular set of activities and outcomes that enable an organizational dialogue about managing privacy risk

CURRENT TARGET

Profiles are a selection of specific Functions, Categories, and Subcategories from the Core that the organization has prioritized to help it manage privacy risk

Implementation Tiers help an organization communicate about whether it has sufficient processes and resources in place to manage privacy risk and achieve its Target Profile

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Current security program framework 2. Privacy program maturity 3. Enterprise Privacy Values

HELPFUL FACTORS
1. NIST CSF alignment
 Common framework structure  Mapping between security and privacy
controls

SCENARIOS

In general, we have seen three scenarios as we have folded the NIST PF into our overall control framework:

1

Revisions to existing controls (through additional Technical Requirements or modifications to existing language)

2 Net new controls (beyond the scope of the NIST CSF)

3 Existing controls without need for modification
