1 The Problem
Raise your hand if you have 100% of the budget you truly need to get your job done right? Raise your hand if you have 100% of the staff you truly need to get your job done right? Today we will talk about:
­ Why does this problem occur? ­ How does this problem manifest itself? ­ How you can all raise your hand the next time you are asked if you have
100% of the budget or staff you need.
3

1 The Problem
Why does this problem occur?
Laws, Regulations and Standards all ask that we design our controls based on Risk
­ HIPPA, GDPR, CCPA, 23 NYCRR 500, GLBA ­ PCI, ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, CIS Controls
Traditional Risk Assessments prioritize Risk based on Impact on Assets:
­ Risk = Likelihood x Impact
Traditional Risk Assessments calculate Impacts using the categories of:
­ Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
4

1 The Problem

Why does this problem occur? (Continued)

Traditional Risk Assessments focus on:
(A) Your Organization (B) Technical Impacts (CIA)

Narrow Scope Technical Focus

Why is this an Issue?
Those who control the budget focus on:
(A) Beyond Your Organization (B) Business Impacts

Broad Scope Business Focus

5

1 The Problem

How does this problem manifest itself?

We have been speaking different languages.
Information Security speaks in risks and costs.
Business speaks in terms beyond risks and costs.

1 The Problem

Who wins the budget debate most of the time?

Risks & Costs InfoSec

Risks, Costs, Customers, Business Goals, Obligations
Business

Unless you recently experienced a breach or the project has political clout, the Business / Revenue Generators win that debate most of the time!

7

2 The Solution
Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) is the prescription for creating a common language between InfoSec and Business!
DoCRA is based on the legal concept of "Due Care." This means, we must protect others from the harm we may cause them, by implementing controls that are not more burdensome to us than the risk of the harm to others. Due Care is level of care that the legal system expects an organization to perform.
8

2 The Solution
DoCRA: Invented for the courtroom - Effective in the boardroom
The two places where things definitively get resolved are the courtroom and the boardroom. DoCRA was invented to communicate in business terms to Judges in the courtroom. DoCRA is equally effective in the boardroom.
9

2 The Solution
The DoCRA Risk Assessment method delivers three powerful capabilities:
1. Legally defensible position by defining what is legally "reasonable" 2. Process to evaluate whether to "invest" or "accept" the risk for risk mitigation 3. Common language between InfoSec and business / regulators / legal system
Each of these three capabilities are extremely powerful and useful. The focus of this presentation is on building a Common Language to secure Budget.
10

2 The Solution
How does DoCRA create a Common Language?

Information Security speaks in risks and costs.
Business speaks in terms beyond risks and costs.
DoCRA fills in the missing components to create a common language as a universal translator.

About DoCRA...
The Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA) methodology was launched as a standard in early 2018
DoCRA is a non-profit organization
DoCRA donated a version of its Risk Assessment Methodology to CIS® (Center for Internet Security)
CIS published this Risk Assessment Method (CIS RAM), containing DoCRA, with the CIS Controls Version 7 in April, 2018
DoCRA can be utilized with CIS, NIST, ISO or any control set
12

2 The Solution

About DoCRA... (Continued)
DoCRA has experienced significant adoption Over 26,000 downloads of the CIS RAM Methodology Used by state Attorneys General to determine whether controls were legally "reasonable" during a breach Utilized by federal regulators to develop postbreach corrective action plans (injunctive relief)

3 Implementing
Level 1 ­ Proven Storyline
Do you know what the movies Rocky, Star Wars, The Matrix, Spider Man, The Lion King, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and countless other hits have in common?
These Blockbuster Movies follow a proven storyline called "The Hero's Journey" Your Budget Requests should also follow a proven storyline... "The Budget Journey"
15

3 Implementing
Level 1 ­ Proven Storyline
A financial template is rarely sufficient! Utilize a Proven Financial Template with a Proven Storyline for requesting budget "The Budget Journey"
Step 1: Establish where you are ­ The current state Step 2: Highlight the discontinuity ­ How the current state does not meet the needs of the business Step 3: Quantify the discontinuity ­ The size of the gap between current state and what is needed Step 4: Identify the solution ­ The solution and how it solves the problem Step 5: Evaluate not having the solution ­ The potential impacts of not having the solution Step 6: Describe implementing the solution ­ The cost and approach for implementing the solution Step 7: Executive Summary ­ One page to summarize the Budget Request
16

3 Implementing
Level 2 ­ Implementing DoCRA Language Involves:
Defining a line in the sand ­ below which you accept the risk and above which you need to do something to mitigate the risk
17

Level 2 ­ Implementing DoCRA Language

3 Implementing

Define a clear line at which you will start to mitigate risk

­ If we have an "unacceptable" impact that is "expected to occur within 3 years" to our Mission, Objectives or Obligations then we agree we must take action to reduce risk.

­ Based on the below Acceptable Risk Definition we will do the following:
Risks scoring less than "9" are acceptable to the business and we are not required to invest further Risks scoring "9" or greater require us to do something and invest further to mitigate

Level 2 ­ Implementing DoCRA Language
Some common concerns at this point.....
­ How do we fill out the business impact scores? ­ Are there templates we can use? ­ How do we get the business to buy-in? ­ It seems daunting and difficult.
We will discuss how to approach this and there are available downloads / resources in Section 5: Applying It

Level 3 ­ Management: Implementing DoCRA Process / Analytics

We often address each risk independently. We have a

Risk #1

tendency to talk about one tree,

Risk #2

and then another tree and then another tree...

Risk #3

Executives want to see the forest as well as the trees and DoCRA Analytics allow us to holistically view the forest as well as the trees.

Real-Life Budget Requests with Different Outcomes Example: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Budget Approval Request
­ Traditional Approach ­ DoCRA Approach
26

4 Real Life Examples
Traditional Approach ­ DLP Budget Request
CISO: "We need a DLP product to catch personal information for claims data that might be leaving the company through email, FTP, web app file shares, or other means." CISO: "I recommend this $225,000 solution that solves this burning issue and gets us everything we need." CFO: "That's a quarter of your budget. Is there a more affordable option or could we implement just a portion of it?" CISO: "The entry level, bare-bones solution from this vendor is $50,000, but it will not eliminate all of our risk." CFO: "Let's start with approving $50,000 this year, and re-evaluate next year."
What happened?
­ The CISO expressed what "bad thing" the investment would address. ­ The CFO had no way to know the potential business impact of NOT making the DLP investment. ­ The CFO decided to provide a "fraction" of the budget requested and re-evaluate later. ­ The CISO received less than 25% of the budget they requested. ­ The company is exposed and the CISO is exposed.

DoCRA Approach ­ Step 5: Not Implementing the Solution
The Risk of NOT Remediating, "PII leaving the Perimeter"
­ A business impact of 1,000 to 9,999 PII records being exposed multiple times a year and a Risk of "20"
­ Utilizing a $150 cost per lost record (2019 Ponemon Report), we calculate a breach cost of $1,500,000 ($150 x 10,000 records), resulting a missed profitability goal by 2% (which we identified as Unacceptable)

You have a choice to make:
A. Continue using the old approach for budget approval or B. Utilize something new and more powerful (DoCRA).

Some Potential Questions or Concerns At This Point...
How do we fill out the business impact scores? Are there templates we can use? How do we get the business buy-in? It seems daunting and difficult.
37

5 Applying It
Success Strategies To Address Questions and Concerns
Many worthwhile endeavors are difficult the first time through it!
­ We all learned to drive cars - that was difficult at first but now it's second nature!
Senior leadership participates in defining and approving the Acceptable Risk Definition. Many organizations perform Level 2 and Level 3 (implementing DoCRA) as one project. Seek out experienced talent inside or outside your organization that have the right skills to lead you through this initiative.
