So What Now?
For the flight home:
­ Podcast: https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/597779069/the-pattern-problem ­ Academic paper from ISAAI Symposium (p. 55): https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/d/0p6djg8a/DW_0120.pdf
Next week:
­ Catalog the use of algorithms within your organization
Three months from now:
­ Construct an Ethical Maturity Graph for each use of algorithms/AI ­ Complete an ethics canvas for each algorithm ­ Examine potential tools to mature along each axis (transparency / accountability / fairness / user data
rights)
Six months from now:
­ Implement appropriate open-source tools ­ Target minimum levels of maturity for each axis ­ Conduct review of progress through self-evaluation

We affirm this court's long history of recognizing that
one's past does not dictate
one's future.
