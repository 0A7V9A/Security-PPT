Cases

Video Surveillance
People v. Tafoya, No. 17CA1243 (Colo. Ct. App., Nov. 27, 2019)
Facts of the case Issue: Does warrantless video surveillance from a public utility pole for ~3 months violate 4th Amendment?

Court Holding
Court: Yes. Carpenter's "narrow decision" did not call into question conventional surveillance techniques ... such as security cameras." Nevertheless, the court held that a pole camera is not a security camera and its pervasive tracking for over 3 months violated the 4th Amendment. United States v. Kelly, 385 F. Supp. 3d 721 (2019),
held a stationary video surveillance of the exterior of an apartment building and the hallway outside of an apartment for forty-nine days did not require a warrant under Carpenter. "Unlike a cell phone, the video surveillance did not track the totality of the defendant's movements."
Takeaway: This is another extension of Carpenter that continues the trend of requiring warrants for digital devices that permit "pervasive tracking."

GPS Data

United States v. Diggs, 385 F. Supp. 3d 648 (201)
Facts of the case Issue: Is the warrantless use of GPS data from a car dealership based on contractual consent a 4th Amendment violation?

Court Holding
Dist. Ct.: Yes Extending Carpenter and Jones while limiting the application of the 3rd party doctrine, court finds 4th Amend. violation Takeaway: If your company collects sensitive data, this case may provide a basis to resist warrantless requests from the government. Review customer privacy agreements for impact on one's reasonable expectation of privacy. Can suspect remove the GPS device? See Heuring v. Indiana, No. 10A-CR-140 (Ind. Ct. App., July 18, 2019) suggesting it may be theft and justify warrant for house. But IN S/C seems skeptical.

GDPR-related Cases
Google v. CNIL, C-507/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:772
Facts of the case Issue: Can Google be required to dereference on all versions of its search engine worldwide?

#RSAC
Court Holding
CJEU: No
Google's agreement to delist results within EU domains was reasonable. Right to be forgotten is not an absolute right. Balancing various rights is likely to involve conflicts of law issues.
Takeaway: Suggests the GDPR will be interpreted in a way that limits impact outside of EU and recognizes conflict of laws issues.

GDPR-related Cases
Glawischnig-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland Limited, C-18/18, ECLI:EU:C:2019:821
Facts of the case Issue: Can Facebook be required to remove "lousy traitor," "corrupt oaf," and a member of a "facist party" as well as "equivalent" posts worldwide?

#RSAC
Court Holding
CJEU: Yes Facebook's agreement to remove the original post for users in Austria deemed insufficient. Court holds Facebook can be required to remove initial posts, any reposts and any "equivalent" posts worldwide. Query: What is equivalent to a "corrupt oaf"? In all languages, in all countries? Takeaway: Suggests the GDPR can be used as a sword within the EU to force global companies with assets in the EU to comply with orders that may not otherwise be enforceable within the U.S. or other countries.

Border Searches
Alasaad v. Nielson, 2019 U.S. Dist. Lexis 195556 (D. Mass., Nov. 12, 2019)
Facts of the case
Issue: Can manual or forensic searches of a cell phones at the border with no reasonable suspicion be limited under the 1st or 4th Amend?

Court Holding
Dist. Ct.: Yes Circuits are split: 4th and 9th require reasonable suspicion for forensic searches. 11th holds contra Extends rationale of Riley (computers are different) Takeaway: Corporate IT moved across the US border may be subject to search and seizure. To protect proprietary data, ensure appropriate policies for IT going abroad.

Cases and Issues to Watch
Encryption
­ India v. Facebook (consolidation of cases across India in the Supreme Court of India. India is seeking to force Facebook to decrypt Messenger and Facebook messages. Case to be heard starting the last week of January 2020.)
Penetration Testing
­ Coalfire cases (two pen testers were arrested on charges of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools while conducting physical security testing under contract to the Iowa State Court Administration (SCA). The County law enforcement officers held them overnight in jail and were only willing to negotiate the charges down to criminal trespass. To date the charges have still not been dropped. Sending shock waves through the pen testing community. Apparently SCA drafted an ambiguous contract, failed to get it legally reviewed. Coalfire had done similar pen testing for SCA four years earlier so did not expect problems.
CFAA
­ WhatsApp (Facebook) v. NSO Group (Facebook claims that NSO Group violated the CFAA by accessing and using WhatApp's servers and the WhatsApp service without authorization by violating the terms of service.)
Standing
­ In re OPM Security Breach Litigation, No. 17-5217 (DC Cir., 2019) ("Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, as we must, we conclude that ... Plaintiffs face a substantial--as opposed to a merely speculative or theoretical--risk of future identity theft."

#RSAC
Cases and Issues to Watch
Biometrics
­ Nimesh Patel, et al v. Facebook, Inc., Case No. 18-15982 (9th Cir., 2019) (unanimous ruling that the mere collection of an individual's biometric data was a sufficient actual or threatened injury under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act ("BIPA") to establish standing to sue in federal court)
Automatic License Plate Readers
­ Canosa v. Coral Gables (Lawsuit contesting the city of Coral Gables use of 30 strategically placed automatic license plate readers (ALPRs), storing data on 30 million license plates for 3 years and made available to 80 LE agencies. Coral Gables and other state defendants' motions to dismiss were denied on the key counts.)
Government "Pings" of suspect's cell phone
­ Commonwealth v. Almonor, 482 Mass. 35 (2019) (Government "ping" of suspect's phone to reveal its real-time location is a search under state's 4th Amend. equivalent.)
Insurance
­ Landry's v. Insurance Co. of the State of PA (Defendant, a subsidiary of AIG, claims it does not have to fund Landry's defense in a suit by JP Morgan Chase over breach-related costs.)
