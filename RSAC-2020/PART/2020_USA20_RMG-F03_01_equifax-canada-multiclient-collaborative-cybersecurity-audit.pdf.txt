Why Go Above and Beyond?

Regulators & Vendor Due Diligence ­ The Details

With an increase in
regulations, clients are conducting 3rd party
due diligence

REGULATIONS

GUIDELINES

OCC 2013-29, OSFI B-10 and PRA Guidelines in UK and
Australia

#RSAC
Current External Audits Are Not Enough

Security due diligence is quite stringent and industry standard reviews are often not seen as enough
Clients are looking for more granular testing of security controls around services relevant to them

REPORT ISO 27001 PCI DSS RoC SOC SSAE18

GAP
Report is not shared and process oriented audit
Report not shared and limited to Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)
Report does not have the depth needed

Managing Client Security Audits is Painful

Client On-site Cybersecurity Audits -- Internal Challenges

Supporting client's audits is time consuming, 1. difficult to schedule and resource intensive
with InfoSec and IT teams under audit fatigue

Significant number of cybersecurity controls 2. tested during client audits on EFX are similar
across the clients as they normally align to industry frameworks such as ISO 27K1, PCI, NIST, CSA, ISF etc.

3.

Remediation activities are at times duplicative and cumbersome to manage

Why A Multi-Client Cybersecurity Audit Made
Sense For Us

Equifax Canada as Testbed for New Initiatives

Equifax Canada is a smaller Business Unit (BU) than our US parent which makes it an ideal environment to pilot projects that can be adopted by other BUs of Equifax
Transformative culture at Equifax encourages new concepts to boost efficiencies where possible and even our biggest clients are open to collaboration with peers

OPTIONS FOR COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT
Consortium
Consortiums have options to conduct on-site verification of security controls for their platform clients with external assessment firms

#RSAC
Major consortiums include TruSight, KY3P, CyberGRX etc. Consortium solutions are still in their infancy, cost may be an issue to clients and their generic security assessments may not meet the scope of various clients. Client right to audit is still in effect and there is a risk of unauthorized disclosure of security audit reports.
10

OPTIONS FOR COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT
Custom Audit
Ideal solution for Equifax Canada is a security audit that is tailored to the client scope

#RSAC
Some of the internal business processes are complex and there are nuances specific to clients that a generic assessment would not cover; Equifax is not a vanilla service provider. Most EFX clients in Canada are not using the Consortium reports. · Yet the cost of annual audits for what in some
cases is a significant number of 3rd parties for a client (including EFX) can be prohibitive, often leading to a risk based approach

#RSAC
How to Get Clients to Buy In

#RSAC
Approaching Clients to Participate

Gaining buy-in from the Client's Cybersecurity team is critical; if they are not supportive this is a non-starter

1.
Arranged meeting with Head of Information Security or their delegate that oversees supplier cyber risk; failure to engage correct stakeholder led to delays in client participation
13

2.
Engaged client's stakeholders such as Procurement, Vendor Management, Risk Management and LoB Relationship Owners; at minimum they need to be aware as they could raise obstacles around buy-in

#RSAC
Overcoming Hurdles

1
Clients were from a range of industries and their supplier risk approach differed greatly
We only approached large FIs and Telco customers, as similar services made scoping easier and they were more receptive to the concept

2

3

Assurance around the assessment was a concern

Timeline to complete

To allay this concern, we notified clients that we would engage an independent reputable 3rd party assessment firm at our expense to perform the assessment

We ensured that the final report would be released to clients by October 31 at the latest to align with year end banking client's reporting deadline

14

#RSAC
Overcoming Hurdles

4
Some of the original participants retired leading to new discussions after the work was already done ­ more than one!

5
Some Legal teams joined the discussion after the fact and made discussions extremely challenging....they were looking for the trick we were playing

Scoping the Controls and Selecting the Right Partner to Deliver Results

#RSAC
SIG as the Baseline for Audit Scope
Scope Selection Delivery

Clients from the FIs and Telco are sending industry standard as well as customized questionnaires with the most common one being the Shared Assessments SIG over those based on ISO27K1 or NIST CSF

· Latest version of the SIG was mapped to the participating clients questionnaires; this was a very time consuming manual task as there were a number of controls that were loosely mapped
· Deltas were also identified and many were noted in Physical Security and Risk Assessment domain areas

SEND-OFF, APPROVAL AND FEEDBACK

SELECTIONS AND TESTING

There were over 1,000 controls identified amongst the client questionnaires and the SIG

The scope was limited to Cybersecurity; Privacy and Compliance domains were removed and Cloud Security was not in scope

A subset of key controls across the domains with a focus on IAM, Network Security, AppSec, and Crypto were selected and sent off to the clients for their feedback and approval

Total of ~350 agreed upon controls were selected for testing

INTEREST

SECURITY AND CONSULTING FIRMS

TOP 10 ACCOUNTING FIRMS

CHOOSING YOUR FIRM

To avoid a conflict of interest, Big 4 firms were not in consideration as both Equifax and respective clients had audit and/or consulting relationships in place

We looked at other nationally recognized accounting and security consulting firms

We chose a US top 10 accounting firm that had a strong third party cyber risk practice with experience performing vendor cybersecurity assessments for banking clients

Depending on the nature of your business, a Security Consulting firm may make more sense instead of an accounting firm

Report Format

Scope Selection Delivery

EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH Evidence based approach was followed, hence operating effectiveness testing was performed
FINDINGS AND SEVERITY As each client has their own risk methodology, it was at their imperative to determine whether an observation was a finding and at what severity

TESTING MATRIX Testing matrix was included in the report that detailed the testing procedure, outlined explicit details on the operational evidence reviewed and the result of the test if there was an observation
CONSISTENT REPORT The report was consistent for all clients for the most part; the only nuance would be an additional business service that may not be relevant to other clients
20

#RSAC
Audit Execution
Scope Selection Delivery

AGREEMENTS Control procedures were agreed upon with the audit firm but were primarily based on the SIG Shared Control Assessment (SCA) procedures

PRE-AUDIT MEETINGS To save on fees, the internal InfoSec team conducted pre-audit meetings to identify controls, collect evidence and handle logistics with SMEs

DATE SELECTION The date was selected to avoid scheduling conflicts with annual ISO 27001, SOC and PCI DSS audits

ON-SITE AUDIT The audit was conducted on-site at US HQ for the Enterprise managed controls and in Canada for the Equifax Canada managed controls
