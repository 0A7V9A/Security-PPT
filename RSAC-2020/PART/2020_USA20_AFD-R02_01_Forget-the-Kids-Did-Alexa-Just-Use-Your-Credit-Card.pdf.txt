Attacking the P2P Channel: Getting hit and "Getting it"
"Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk as these two scumbags are nothing but a scam.
Paid for 4 tickets for the 1/9 game to John Doe who said once funds clear he'll send me the tickets. Next day, no tickets and no further texts."
"They insist on Apple Pay, Zelle, or PayPal Friends & Family. This way when they steal your money there are no resolutions to get your money back."
"These %!@&#!'s are still going at it here...the 4 tickets I paid for on 1/9 are still being listed as available."
"I'M NOT GOING AWAY."

Key Takeaways & Applications
In the immediate timeframe you should:
­ Identify existing and future channels with cross-channel risk (i.e., online/P2P + call center)
­ Identify whether data can easily be shared across channels (and implement)
Over the next 3-6 months you should:
­ Define an omni-channel anti-fraud strategy ­ Consider how your (consumer) identity strategy fits in
Over the next 6-18 months
­ Implement omni-channel fraud strategies to reduce cross-channel and inchannel fraud.
­ Keep your solution flexible for future channels
