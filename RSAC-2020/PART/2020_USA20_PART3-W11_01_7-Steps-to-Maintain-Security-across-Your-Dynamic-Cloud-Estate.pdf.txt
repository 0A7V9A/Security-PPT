3. Asset Visibility ­ Have a Collection Plan
#1 Critical Control for Center for Internet Security (CIS)
Solution Designed for Cloud Asset Visibility
­ Different Assets Types: Account / Owners / IaaS / PaaS / Serverless ­ Different Designs: Services In Isolation vs Relationships &
Dependencies
Frequency: Weekly, day, near real-time
­ Dynamic / Ephemeral ­ Open APIs / More Sources of Change
Coordinated Approach
­ Every team pulling inventory data is costly and can disrupt operations and deployment
Security and Service Owner Accessible

Provider Hardening Guides and Standards

2 Target Environments

Dev / Test

Internal Services

Production SaaS

Business Wide Standards

3 Exceptions
Accept Risk, Workflow and documentation

Example:
EC2 Instance is Publicly Accessible and has elevated privileges for S3 Buckets -> CIS AWS, NIST 800-171, EU-GDPR

All Production SaaS Accounts

Whitelist / Suppress accepted EC2 instances with Tag App1
