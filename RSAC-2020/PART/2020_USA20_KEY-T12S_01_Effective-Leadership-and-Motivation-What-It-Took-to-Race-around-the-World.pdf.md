HM King Hussein l Amman, Jordan, June 1990
" I am proud of Tracy for having fulfilled her dream; for having risen to the challenge by no more than her own will and her unbeatable, infectious and inspiring spirit. I share this pride with the multitudes. Tracy and her gallant crew have achieved what many thought impossible and I am delighted that Royal Jordanian Airlines was amongst the privileged few who sponsored Maiden. "
