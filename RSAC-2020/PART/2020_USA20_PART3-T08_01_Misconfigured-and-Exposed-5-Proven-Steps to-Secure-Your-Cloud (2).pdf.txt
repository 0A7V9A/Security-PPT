EMERGING CHALLANGES

#RSAC

#RSAC

CLOUD IS REDEFINING HOW APPLICATIONS ARE BUILT

Application Modernization
8 of 10
enterprise apps today are cloud-enabled/cloud-native

Containers Have Gone Mainstream
1 2 and
enterprises will use containers by 2021

Serverless Computing On The Rise
2 in 10
enterprises will embrace serverless in 2021

CI/CD IS ENABLING SECURITY EARLIER IN THE LIFECYCLE

#RSAC

Build
Integrate vulnerability and compliance scanning into every build as part of any CI workflow

Deploy
Secure every deployment by seamlessly integrating security into continuous delivery process

Run
Reduce burden on security teams in production with minimized threat footprint

Shift Left ­ Ideal to implement security early in the dev lifecycle

MOST ORGANIZATIONS ARE MULTI-CLOUD
81% of cloud users leverage 2 or more cloud providers

THE SECURITY LANDSCAPE IS FRAGMENTED
Disparate point solutions result in a lack of risk clarity and ultimately increased operational burden

#RSAC
Compliance Risks

42%
of CloudFormation templates are insecure

76%
of cloud workloads
expose SSH (22)

60%
of cloud storage has
logging disabled

CLOUD NATIVE SECURITY MATURITY - WHERE ARE YOU TODAY?

#RSAC

Quality guardrails
Security standards, architecture and compliance solidified in
infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates. No manual changes.
MVP guardrails
Auto-remediation of the most common cloud antipatterns and misconfiguration. E.G., public S3 buckets and databases receiving traffic directly from t the internet.
FOUNDATIONAL

ADVANCED

Cloud native security
CI/CD pipeline with organically embedded and centralized security, compliance, risk and cost controls across all clouds and workload types e.g., laaS, Paas, containers, serverless, VMs, and SaaS.
Code movement transparency
Who, what, when and where of development pipeline understood and agreed to by all teams. Single pipeline/ process established for all cloud changes to apps, assets, data, etc.
Deep cloud visibility
Situational awareness of multi-cloud security posture, assets, configuration, and compliance.

APPLY WHAT YOU LEARNED TODAY

Next week
Review CIS benchmarks
Figure out if you have centralized logging of FW & proxy logs

Next 90 days
Determine where you are on the cloud maturity model
Create a plan around the five steps
Complete steps one and two

#RSAC
Next six months
Set and programmatically enforce standards (step three) Begin the process of transforming your team into coders (step four) Begin step five and identify the who/where/ what of your dev pipeline
