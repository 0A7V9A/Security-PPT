Abstract
Today firms need to take a holistic approach to identifying and protecting their sensitive data. As data is everywhere, this session will look at protection of data in the enterprise, on the network, in the cloud, and in applications. There is no single answer to data protection but in the face of growing privacy regulations, firms must demonstrate compliance.

Data Protection and Privacy Regulations
Everything begins with good corporate and work force policies
­ Demonstrating compliance starts with having a documented policy ­ Check out http://oecdprivacy.org/ for 8 "Privacy Principles"
 Establish a Data Protection Policy / Standard ­ Over communicate to your workforce! ­ Make it know that it is everyone's responsibility ­ Partner with HR, Legal, and Compliance when establishing your policy

Data Protection and Privacy Regulations
Practice good data hygiene
­ Establish a data retention policy and communicate it (often) to your workforce!
­ Remove the data when you are done with it
 Sponsor a company "Digital House Spring Cleaning Day" annually ­ Ask senior managers to set the tone ­ Encourage managers to push this message down to their staff ­ Work with your HR, Legal, and Compliance departments ­ Use the days before the event to provide training and awareness ­ Do this at home too ­ does your town sponsor shredding days?

Data Protection in the Enterprise

#RSAC
Data Protection in the Enterprise
Classic Data Leakage Protection (DLP) software goes here
­ When were your DLP policies and thresholds last reviewed by senior management?
­ Do your policies accurately reflect your firm's risk tolerance for data leakage? ­ Are you monitoring the most common data leakage vectors ­ email, web
uploads, USB write, FTP transmissions, off network activity? ­ Are all your documents classified and does your DLP system utilize those tags to
improve detection and protection? ­ Does your company block data from exfiltration or just monitor? ­ Does your company publish metrics to demonstrate compliance?
Call to action if you ask yourself these questions and you're not comfortable with your answers

Data Protection in the Enterprise
 Make patching a priority (establish zero tolerance) ­ Know your inventory and relentlessly patch everywhere
(infrastructure, software, middleware, APIs, etc.)
 Make the ability to send/receive external email a privilege ­ Why does every worker need the ability to use external email? ­ According to the Verizon DBIR (Data Breach Investigations
Report), 94% of malware was delivered by email; 23% by web!
10

#RSAC
Data Protection in the Enterprise
 Establish a repeat offender process for data leakage events ­ Establish consequences for data leakage ­ Make management aware of their workers incidents
 Wherever possible, lock it down (web sites, USB access, FTP, off-network access)
­ Not everyone needs to use these services, so why allow them by default?
­ Does your company have a speed bump for unclassified web pages?

Data Protection on the Network

#RSAC
Data Protection on the Network
Most organizations run complex networks based on Microsoft Windows Servers which utilize Active Directory  Implement a Microsoft Active Directory Red Forest to protect all
privileged domain accounts Identify and lock down all functional IDs, especially privileged IDs! Scan regularly for Open Shares and lock them down! Create a dedicated employee Wi-Fi and Guest network separate from your production network
­ Only allow vendors access for limited durations to Guest network

Data Protection in the Cloud

#RSAC
Data Protection in the Cloud
Companies are embracing the cloud at different speeds
­ Cloud security is a joint effort between the cloud provider and company ­ Understand what clouds services are in use at your company and what
data is being stored in the cloud ­ Keeping the data secure means establishing the right controls and "guard
rails" so that any breach is quickly detected and contained
 Always encrypt your data in the cloud and keep your keys separate and secure
15

#RSAC
Data Protection in Applications

#RSAC
Data Protection in Applications
Data is generally more well protected inside applications where only authorized workers have access  Review authorizations of your workforce regularly, especially
privileged access to your applications and infrastructure
When data leaves the protected boundaries of the application, it becomes "unstructured data" which limits the controls that are in place  Reduce the amount of unstructured data by putting limits on
the amount of data that can be exported by an application
