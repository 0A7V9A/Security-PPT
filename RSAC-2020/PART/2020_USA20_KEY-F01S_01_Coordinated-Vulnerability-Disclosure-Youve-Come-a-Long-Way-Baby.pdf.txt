Non-Interchangeable Vuln Discovery Words Matter

#RSAC
Survey on Coordinated Disclosure
· Conducted by 451 Research from December 2018 to January 2019
· 1,000 respondents across a range of industries and organization sizes in the US, Germany, France, Italy and the UK.
· Respondents reported enterprise roles such as application development, infrastructure and information security, as well as security consultants, third-party vulnerability assessors or penetration testers, and independent security researchers.
· Respondents were required to have an average to high level of familiarity with vulnerability disclosure models to participate.

First let's start with some history...

#RSAC
L0pht gets an email from Microsoft

Nov, 1997 Dildog@l0pht.com releases IE 4.0 RCE vulnerability and POC without coordinating with the vendor.
A week later Scott Culp from MSRC contacts contact@l0pht.com.

A haiku:
Microsoft IE Is there no security? Not if you ask me.
dildog@l0pht.com (11/1/97)

MSRC First

Forest Puppy

1999: RFPolicy attempted to codify expectations for disclosure.

No more open-ended forever-days?

Actions that researchers take now

#RSAC
What's an appropriate time frame for a vendor to correct a vulnerability once notified, before the security researcher discloses it?

#RSAC
Sentiment has changed over the years
· Most (90%) respondents see vulnerability disclosure as a public good, that the identification of vulnerabilities increases transparency and is good for the overall security posture for everyone.
· A majority, 62%, do not think prior permission from a product or application owner is required.

MS Bug Bounties 2013: Bounty Smarter, Not Harder

April 2016: Come At Me! November 2016: Hack Me Gently With A Chainsaw

#RSAC
What do researchers expect?

47% of participants had worked with bug bounties.

#RSAC

This is what they thought.

#RSAC
Knowing About Bugs is 1/100th of the Battle
· Nearly half (47%) of organizations have implemented bug bounty programs, but they say that only 19% of vulnerability reports come via bug bounty programs.
· Only 63% of open source vulnerabilities reported are being fixed.

#RSAC
So you say you've come a long way.

#RSAC
The process is mostly working!
· Three out of four organizations report having an established method for receiving vulnerability reports from security researchers.
· For those organizations that received an unsolicited vulnerability report, 90% of vulnerabilities were disclosed in a coordinated fashion between security researchers and organizations.
· More than one-third (37%) of organizations have received an unsolicited disclosure report in the past 12 months.

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
· Next week you should:
­ Assess your internal process maturity in handling existing or publicly disclosed bugs. Can you handle the truth?!
­ Understand if your organization has a CVD policy with a contact. If not, get one created.
· In the first three months following this presentation you should:
­ Create a response process to handle incoming researcher disclosures.
· Within six months you should:
­ If you build any applications and aren't performing security testing in your SDLC start!
­ Start the journey to a full SDLC security process from threat modeling to rapid response.
