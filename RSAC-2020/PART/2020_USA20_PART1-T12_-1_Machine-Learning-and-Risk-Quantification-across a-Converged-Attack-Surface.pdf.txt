#PART1-T12

#RSAC
Sound Familiar?

Security Engineer
VM gives me good info, but I've got 100 other tools to manage and implement ­ And no one's patching anything anyway.
CIO
Manage more tools, give more access, deploy more appliances. It never ends and my team is already overwhelmed!

CISO
All these vulnerabilities every month make it look like my team isn't doing any work! I need better data!
CFO
We can't afford a data breach, but the security team keeps asking for more money, and I have no idea if it's helping or not.

SysAdmin / DBA
Stop giving me 12,000 page reports on patching things I can't patch. Things will break! Stop telling me how to do my job!
Developers
I always write secure code. We don't need anymore security tools slowing everything down. Just going to ignore all of that.

RISK QUANTIFICATION
When business leaders ask
"HOW SECURE ARE WE?"
They don't want a 300 page answer

METRICS ARE THE ROSETTA STONE OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION
"Successful leaders will enjoy better performing tools to assess and understand where an enterprise's cyber security practices are working effectively, including more accurate and descriptive company-wide security metrics and ratings."

Risk Quantification: Five Key Questions

Where are we What should we

exposed?

focus on first?

How mature are our
processes?

How are we reducing exposure over time?

How do we compare to our peers?

If Everything Is Important ­ Nothing Is!
CVSS: High/Critical = 59%
"CVSS is designed to identify the technical severity of a vulnerability. What people seem to want to know, instead, is the risk a vulnerability or flaw poses to them, or how quickly they should respond to a vulnerability."

AI? Machine Learning?
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
"Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making computers behave in ways that, until recently, we thought required human intelligence."
~ Andrew Moore
Dean of the School of Computer Science: Carnegie Mellon University

MACHINE LEARNING
"Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience."

"Apply" What We We've Discussed
Immediate Actions:
­ Take a Risk Based Approach: Identify Business System and Process Integrity Risks
­ Establish metrics for the `five key questions'
In three months:
­ Implement process changes ­ Benchmark internally and begin benchmarking externally
