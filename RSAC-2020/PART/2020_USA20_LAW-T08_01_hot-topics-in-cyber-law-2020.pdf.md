Hacking Democracy
Lucy L. Thomson, Esq. CISSP, CIPP/US February 2020

THE THREAT LANDSCAPE
The potential for surprise in the cyber realm will increase in the next year and beyond as billions more digital devices are connected ­ with relatively little built-in security ­ and both nation states and malign actors become more emboldened and better equipped in the use of increasingly widespread cyber toolkits. . . ." Our adversaries and strategic competitors probably already are looking to the 2020 US elections as an opportunity to advance their interests. More broadly, US adversaries and strategic competitors almost certainly will use online influence operations to try to weaken democratic institutions, undermine US alliances and partnerships, and shape policy outcomes in the United States and elsewhere. Adversaries and strategic competitors also may seek to use cyber means to directly manipulate or disrupt election systems--such as by tampering with voter registration or disrupting the vote tallying process--either to alter data or to call into question our voting process.

OUTSOURCING ELECTIONS "Election Technology Industry"

 Three top-tier vendors cover 92 percent of total eligible voters
 Six other firms provide specialized technology

 Private sector's role in supporting elections
· Sell Integrated Voting Solutions to state and local election officials, typically including a package of hardware, software, services, and support
· Manage Databases ­ voter registration, e-pollbooks, candidates
· Manufacture Voting Machines
· Design Ballots
· Develop software to program machines
· Host Results Websites
 Over 60 percent of American voters cast ballots on systems owned and operated by a single vendor
· Potential for a single point of failure · Exploitation point for hackers to target election systems · Supply chain risks · Ownership issues

CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS
· To protect the integrity and security of U.S. elections, all local, state, and federal elections should be conducted using humanreadable paper ballots by the 2020 presidential election.
· States should mandate a specific type of audit known as a "risklimiting" audit prior to the certification of election results.
· Internet voting should not be used at the present time, and it should not be used in the future until and unless very robust guarantees of secrecy, security, and verifiability are developed and in place.
· Election administrators should routinely assess the integrity of voter registration databases and put in place systems that detect efforts to probe, tamper with, or interfere with voter registration systems.
· Jurisdictions that use electronic pollbooks should have backup plans in place to provide access to current voter registration lists in the event of any disruption.
· Election systems should continue to be considered as U.S. Department of Homeland Security-designated critical infrastructure.

KEY STEPS TO PROTECT ELECTION SYSTEMS
1) Replace aging, outdated, vulnerable voting machines with voter-verified paper ballots
2) Conduct Post-election Audits ­ check that voting systems properly counted ballots
3) Adopt and Follow Cybersecurity Standards, Guidelines and Best Practices
4) Funding ­ Address Chronic Underfunding of Elections
2020 Federal Grants to States for Election Security Improvements  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Pubic Law 116-93 became law on
12/20/19
· $425 million for the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to make election security grants to states "for activities to improve the administration of elections for Federal office, including to enhance election technology and make election security improvements."
· No cybersecurity requirements; NIST cybersecurity guidelines are voluntary
 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020, S. 1790, Public Law 116-92
· Section LXV, Election Matters
