2 Meaningful Visibility
User Activity Monitoring (UAM) is the monitoring of user behavior

Observation of user interaction
with data

Use of analytics to understand user behavior

Visibility to potential risk and
threats

Operationalizing more effective investigations and adaptive approaches
to managing risk

Continuous evaluation for real time risk quantification at the user level

10

UAM stakeholders are from across the business

Employees

Worker's Advocates

Business Owners

CISO

Human Resources

IT Team

Legal Team

Stakeholders must be involved from design to implementation
Worker's Advocates will focus on protecting employee rights
HR teams hold very sensitive data and are also involved in investigation process.
Legal teams can help you navigate the various laws & regulations

11

#RSAC

Privacy regulations put employees at the center of your program

Accuracy

Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

Integrity & confidentiality

GDPR, CCPA, etc.

Purpose Limitation

Storage limitation

Data Minimization

Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment:
· Ensures there is a balance between Personal data & IP protection & workforce privacy
Start with a Data Protection Impact Assessment:
· Ensures there is a balance between Personal data & IP protection & workforce privacy
Limit scope of program to critical risks & necessary data collection first
· Reduce how long you keep data · Don't get involved in diagnosis!

Impact is much lower when you apply privacy by design or by default.

3 Manage Appropriate Access to your Employee Data

Limit access to the data collected

Anonymize user identity in
risk evaluation and reporting

Use real-time notifications to indicate
and educate users

Ensure worker advocates and related stakeholders are part of the re-identification

13

4 Behavior and Risk Centric
Monitor Entities
· Learn their normal behavior · Learn how they behave relative to their peers · Learn how they interact with critical data and IP · Based on deviations, compute an entity risk
Understand Humans
· Track and assess human factors
Shift to a risk-based approach
· An `event' can both be good or bad, depending on the context of the entity

Enable Adaptive Responses

· Critical Path to Insider Threat · SOFIT

Activities that, out of context would be benign,
now flag an attack
16

"Detection Rules" that normally generate a lot of false positives are now weighed by the risk of the entities.

5 Enable Adaptive Responses

Risk Adaptive Protection:
· Dynamically apply monitoring and enforcement controls
· Based on the calculated behavioral risk level of users and value of data accessed.
Benefit:
· Better understand risky behavior and automate policies
· Dramatically reduces the quantity of alerts requiring investigation.
