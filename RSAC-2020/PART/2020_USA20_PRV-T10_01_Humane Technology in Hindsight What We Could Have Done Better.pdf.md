What is "humane technology"? (a working definition)

Humane technology respects and fosters the capacities needed to be free beings, including authentic, freely chosen actions
Humane technology promotes the right to determine our own fates, participate in the systems that govern us, and for an individual to pursue happiness within boundaries that don't harm the same opportunities for others

Privacy
(ability to control who you are in a context, ability to grow without oversight, etc.)
@mberk @craigspi @joejerome

Autonomy
(being self-ruled; actions not influenced or controlled by
others)
3

Shared Values
(actively contributing to the shaping of the systems that
govern and restrain us)

Privacy is NOT just about "appropriate control"
Privacy challenge:
­ Everyone wants a piece of you ­ Presumption of consent
The solution to privacy challenge is not to offer more toggles, options, controls, or dashboards.
­ Individuals are drowning in privacy controls that are hard to find, they do not understand
Privacy is about having the presumption that your data is a piece of you, and no one has a right to it if it isn't freely given via a conscious choice. Today's models offer neither.

Permissive attitude, vague assurances

Vague and broadly written privacy policie  "we can do anything we want" attitude
Limited compliance requirements when you've promised nothing
No need to think about the consequences if we think we're "allowed" to do it (morality doesn't matter)
Afraid to promise customers anything because today's line in the sand is tomorrow's opportunity

The "user" is not a commodity

Myth/aspiration: build the best product and the revenue will follow
Reality: trap the human, funnel their actions, and get what
you want

Exploitative design ­ using platform power to disadvantage users
­ Products are designed to deliver results to the company, not free action, choice, and exploration by the human
­ Actions are extracted from people, not freely given Goals: Time spent, stickiness, controversy  ad revenue, data sales Methods: growth hacking, experimentation, algo optimizations w/o limits
­ Eliminates core elements of humanity: the possibility of authentic action, free choice, shared contexts
Business model is about eliciting actions, not providing value
­ Carefully designed funnels obfuscate options (location data, notifications) Pre-checked boxes; choices difficult to exercise or nonexistent; hidden Newsfeed algorithms geared toward "time spent," with end goal of ad revenue "Consent" banners hide information, make choices difficult to find
Not evil by design: narrowly focused success metrics
­ E.g., corporate goals about growth forget about healthy ecosystem

@mberk Concern: we've accepted a world in which a hidden opt out is considered a choice, an @@jocerajeigrosimnpieterruptive experience is considered acceptable10, and our actions are commodities to be acquired

Go with others; Put a person's humanity first

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
--African Proverb

Strategizing  better outcomes Go in groups; stand with others and live to fight again Understand other perspectives without [necessarily] yielding to them. Empathy makes you a partner and not an adversary. Sometimes yielding today sets you up for a bigger victory tomorrow

"Treat the user as an end in herself and not [merely] as a means to your goal.

@mberk @craigspi @joejerome

--Immanuel Kant (paraphrased by Mary)

Your user is a person, not a commodity. Put their humanity first. Recognize when
Funnels are extracting "choices" Design is obfuscating choice A yes/no is not respected

Some common deflections in our shared experiences
You're not seeing the big picture.
You're too passionate about this cause. (In other scenarios, you'd be praised for having principles)
We can't cede ground now, and need every advantage we can take, but we can scale back after we've won the space
You're not being a team player. Get on board with the new paradigm.
If we don't do this, someone else will (and it's better for the world to have us do it than someone less principled)

Questions

What's one instance you've seen of a company going out of their way to design responsible, ethical, or humane technology? When you've advocated in the past for more responsible or humane technology, what reactions have you received? We'd love to hear about an example of one positive or one negative reaction. What common deflections or put-downs have you seen toward people advocating for more humane technology? What are the patterns and tropes that advocates should be aware of? What trends make you fear for the future? What trends give you hope for the future? And what can be done NOW to mitigate the fears you have? How can one person amplify their impact when advocating for ethical technology? How can they do so in a way that doesn't jeopardize their job, and that has maximum impact? What would you change about the [working] definition of "humane technology"? What is your audacious challenge to tech companies going forward? What are the signs of an inhumane or unethical technology landscape? What is your challenge to tech companies of all stripes?

What is your audacious challenge to tech companies?

Mary:
­ Think how you would treat another person sitting next to you ­ someone you value and respect ­ and treat your product's users the same way.
­ Align your goals with those of your users. And where you can't, set out bold lines in the sand for the principles you'll adhere to and the actions you'll never/always take.

Intro (6 MINUTES)

People intros - 2 minutes

Plan - 1 minute
­ I'll be moderating and participating at moments ­ We'll explore some history, talk about some common issues
we've seen in our careers -- and in the process, hope to leave you with the ability to recognize common patterns and address them -- and we'll challenge you in your personal situations to raise the bar for all of us. ­ This will be a guided conversation that contains a number of conversational prompts, but that panelists (including me) will feel free to share their thoughts in an impromptu format.

Let's get some audience feedback. (Goal is to get audience engaged early). Raise your hands if the following apply to you. - 3 minutes

­ How many of you have seen your company or industry do something

That disadvantages users in favor of company goals (e.g., hiding opt out terms, hiding ability to unsubscribe)

That is clearly unethical?

­ How many of you spoke up about it?

­ How many of you were the only person speaking up about it?

­@mFboerrk how many of you did it hurt your career?

@­@jocerajsAeitgrLoasLmpriteReIdG.HT, so we're all in good company here. Let's get

What we've seen -- setting some context (6 MINUTES)

#RSAC

­ Here are some things you've probably seen in the news, and some of tech's most challenging moments. As you see these, think about (1) the methods used to wield advantage over someone and (2) the mechanisms involved that undermine the agency of the end user/consumer

­ Each person introduce ONE of our themes. 2 minutes each.

Questions from the moderator (23 MINUTES)
­ (3 questions, 2.5 responses per question, 3 minutes per response) = ~23 minutes
­ 1: Let's get started on a positive note. What's one instance you've seen of a company going out of their way to design responsible, ethical, or humane technology?
­ 2: What is one deflections against humane technology that you've seen repeatedly in your career? Please share an example of this in action. In hindsight, what would be your best argument against it, or tactic for mitigating it?
­ 3: What is one trend that makes you most concerned for the future? Given this trend, what can be done NOW to mitigate the fears you have?

Your challenge to the audience (6 MINUTES) ­ 3 of us - 2 minutes each, 1 slide each.

Questions from the audience (REMAINING TIME = 10 MINUTES)
­ Expecting 2 questions, with 2 of us responding to each question for 2.5 minutes each (or ceding our time two someone else
­ Plus 2 minutes logistical time for selecting questions

#RSAC
Session outline

Introduction (5 minutes) Moderator to introduce panelists (referencing your bios)
­ Moderator to share rough session plan ­ Moderator to invite engagement from the audience. "Let's get some feedback from the audience. Raise your hand if...." (questions
prepared)
Context -- common themes we've seen in our careers (6 minutes) Each panelist to introduce one slide for 2 minutes. Slide to contain a theme they've seen repeatedly. Based on our conversation notes and pulled from v1/v2 draft slides. Questions from the moderator (23 minutes) These will be drawn from our conversation notes. No surprises, but I'd like to keep it slightly fresh to make for a more authentic conversation. You can guess what they'll be based on v1 of the deck.... Planning 3 questions, with 2 panelists responding to each question for 3.5 minutes (and making room for a third to pile on if desired). Will have additional questions ready from our conversation notes if needed. Panelist challenge to the audience (6 minutes)Each panelist gets 2 minutes (and 1 slide if desired) to describe their challenge to the audience. 2 minutes each. Questions from the audience (10 minutes)Expecting 2 questions, with 2 panelists responding to each question for 2.5 minutes (or to leave it a bit impromptu, giving panelists the option to cede their time to someone else). Which panelists speak can be decided based on the question.
