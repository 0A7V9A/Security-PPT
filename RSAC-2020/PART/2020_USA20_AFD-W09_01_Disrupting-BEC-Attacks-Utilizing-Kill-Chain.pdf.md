How Do We Fight BEC?
By sharing fraud information, banks can stop future crime (to an extent) ­ Banks with mule accounts can investigate ­ Other banks can identify fraud transactions ­ Banks can use the fraud indicators to prevent future fraud transactions appropriately Effective but relies on confirmed fraud that's already happened Targeting at BEC fraud before it happens currently ­ Education ­ Controls ­ Sharing Sliding further left of the Kill Chain, how do we fight BEC before it happens?

Stopping Fraud Before It Happens

Acting on "fresh" money mules helps stop fraud before the transfer happens ­ Contributes to analysis on recruiting trends and cashout methods

Relying on the external sourcing from Agari helps overcome various challenges for banks
­ There are barriers to sharing today bank-to-bank
­ Measuring the success of this sharing against BEC can demonstrate the value mule sharing can bring

FS-ISAC can help overcome those barriers to sharing, using value added intelligence to stop fraud and protect customers
