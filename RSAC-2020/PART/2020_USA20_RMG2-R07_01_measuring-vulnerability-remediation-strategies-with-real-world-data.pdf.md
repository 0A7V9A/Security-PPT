A: Nope; not even close.
Q: Can organizations remediate vulnerabilities before exploitation?
A: Not before weaponization but maybe before you're exploited.
Q: Can orgs remediate all high-risk vulns in their environment?
A: Yes! Some pay down vuln debt with better focus and execution.
Q: What factors drive better/worse remediation performance?

Q: Can orgs remediate all high-risk vulns in their environment?
A: Yes! Some pay down vuln debt with better focus and execution.
Q: What factors drive better/worse remediation performance?

#RSAC
How do we measure "better" or "worse" performance?
Coverage: Completeness of remediation. What percentage of exploited or "high-risk" vulnerabilities are remediated? Efficiency: Precision of remediation. What percentage of remediated vulnerabilities are actually high-risk? Velocity: Speed and progress of remediation. Capacity: Number of vulnerabilities that can be remediated in a given timeframe and net gain or loss. Overall: Composite performance measure based on the above.

#RSAC
So What?
What should I take away from this talk?

#RSAC
Strategy makes a huge difference
The difference between `gaining ground' and `falling behind' in vulnerability remediation
comes down to strategy.
35

#RSAC
What do you mean by strategy?
"Strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely
positions the firm to create sustainable advantage"
36

#RSAC
Strategic choices in vulnerability remediation
Which performance measures matter most to us? Which vulnerabilities should we prioritize for remediation? How do we execute remediation most effectively? How do we organize and govern for effective execution?

"Compared to a strategy fixing all CVEs with a CVSS of 7 or more, our model achieves 2X the efficiency
(61% vs 31%), half the effort (19K vs 37K CVEs), 1/3 false positives (7K vs
25K CVEs), and better coverage (62% vs 53%)."
