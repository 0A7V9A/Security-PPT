The digitization of the financial industry results in a big improvement of the user experience
Customers expect a similar banking experience compared to their Google, Facebook, Amazon experience
But do customers still know how to remain safe?

Topics for today...
What has changed -and why-, in our authentication & security landscape due to digitization and regulation? Which Modus Operandi development do we see because of digitization and how do we counter them? How do we ensure that our traditional and new-to-digital group of customers are protected against cybercrime?

What we've seen so far
The number of digital interactions have increased while the number of `traditional' interactions have decreased We've added lots of functionality to the mobile banking app that has greatly improved the user experience in most daily banking processes However, this has resulted in fraudsters switching their focus to:
gaining access to a user's mobile banking environment

How has fraud evolved in the era of digitization?
Focus on new Modus Operandi

QR code enrollment flow to add 2nd app
"Hey, can you pay this train ticket for me in cash? I can pay you back immediately via my phone"
"Sure, no problem. How would you pay me back?"

#RSAC
Fraudster configures new device, sets new pin etc and can transfer money
Confirmation SMS is sent that new device has been activated

#RSAC
Extra confirmation had to be added to raise awareness
Extra confirmation on customers' device before enrollment could be completed

My internet banking is having troubles, and I need to pay this invoice... otherwise the debt collector will come by

Cash out enablers

#RSAC
Mobile apps offer more functionality
Mobile wallets to add POS payment functionality App also used for consent in web Payment requests are very well known in The Netherlands, allows for fake payment requests Debit / Credit card settings can be changed Address can be changed, risk of fraudulent new product agreements Use SSO functionality into web environment to gain access to all online functionality

#RSAC
Instant Payments could make cashout easier
Previously, fraudsters preferred to have mule accounts at the same bank as their victims due to the speed of money transfers
With the introduction of instant payments this is no longer required
We expect to see complex mule networks with multiple levels, where:
­ mules at the front of the chain are cheap and easy to swap, and ­ mules deeper in the network are most valuable and used for cash-out
To improve detection, Dutch banks are working on adding the `Fraud Indication Marker' to all Instant Payments

How to protect our customers?

#RSAC
How can we protect our customers?
When performing consent, provide clear verification information about the transaction Offer a primary authentication avenue but enable alternatives for customer groups that can't or really don't want to use it Consistent communications: If we say `we will never ask you to login through an e-mail or SMS', make sure we don't Central and up to date page to provide customers information about secure banking
22

#RSAC
How can we protect our customers?
Work together with other banks for broader campaigns
­ All safe banking campaigns in Dutch media originate from the Dutch Payment Association, with input from participating banks
Work together with community organizations and interest groups to raise awareness for specific groups of customers Warn specific target groups for specific MO's
23

#RSAC
How can we protect our customers?
To decrease risk of fraudulent app enrollment we will require a non-phishable means during app (re)enrollment flow
­ Government ID read-out using NFC and/or camera ­ Biometrics
Keep authentication options clear and easy, so customers know what to expect Authentication avenues should be usable over multiple channels
24

#RSAC
Conclusions

#RSAC
Back to our question...
But do customers still know how to remain safe?
26

#RSAC
Apply this information to your organization
Short term actions:
­ Re-assess your risk appetite and validate that added functionalities and growth of online channels are still represented correctly
­ Evaluate the increased vulnerabilities you experience, when phishing or social engineering schemes turn more personal and face-2-face
­ Increase effort to make customers more aware of what they're giving consent to and how to confirm that they're on the correct site
Long term actions:
­ Consider non-phishable authentication means and where they should play a role in your online eco-system
