Breaking Bad AI
Closing the Gaps Between Data Security and Science

#RSAC
Abstract
LONG: For years the security industry has discussed the leap into cloud computing as a paradigm shift. Get ready for another leap, as data platforms are rapidly becoming AI/ML development that requires its own new species of safety validations. This presentation, based on years of field test, will provide a quick intro and practical test list for security teams to comfortably engage data science projects.
QUICK: If you have AI/ML projects and aren't sure how to validate their safety, this presentation is for you. Don't let another AI project go forward without security assessments being in the conversation.

Breaking: Replace, Adjust, Keep Hammering

Breaking Bad: Stop, Toss Bag, Build Standards of Trust (Quality Assurance)

"Break Bad": American 1880s Colloquialism for Flaws
"Character" flaw in trusted systems (e.g. business logic)
(Supreme Court, City and County of New York, 1886) 1. Financial pressures to survive can breed
immoral safety shortcuts (for high margins)
2. Unregulated margins attracts increasingly
organized greed (in unsafe/abusive markets)
3. If no enforcement, then expansive disasters
(immoral expansion and ultimately "war")

Easy to Explain Why March 2018 Uber Killed a Woman
Company BLIND to Repeated Warnings: Operated With NO SAFETY DIVISION
· "...incident where a car mounted the sidewalk was ignored"
· "...hitting things every 15,000 miles", a vehicle was damaged "nearly every other day"
· "...placing too much emphasis on the number
of miles driven as a metric for how advanced its software was getting"
Miles driven is NOT a reasonable benevolence test... just as repeatedly adding 2+2 could never be a metric of math skill. Duh.
