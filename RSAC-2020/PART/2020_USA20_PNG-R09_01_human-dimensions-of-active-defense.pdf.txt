 The forums targeted for collection are sites on which criminal activity is planned and conducted
­ TTPs are traded for purposes of facilitating computer crime ­ The forum focuses exclusively on commission of computer crime and
not other crimes (e.g., child pornography or terrorism)
 Access to the forum was secured lawfully
­ Deception (e.g., a fake identity) generally maybe used ­ Stolen credentials or a technical exploit may not
 If a fake identity was used, it was not an assumed identity of a real Up.S.eDrespaortnmenot rof sJuostimce eone with a special status
