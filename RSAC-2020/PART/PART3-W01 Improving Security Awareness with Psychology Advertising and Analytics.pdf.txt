"Apply" Slide
Ask Yourself: We cannot ignore the human element when designing cybersecurity awareness programs. Does my cybersecurity awareness program account for the complexities of human nature? Ask Yourself: Is my cybersecurity awareness program designed for behavior change or knowledge acquisition? Both? Neither? Ask Yourself: Are we targeting the right audiences, at the right time, with the right content? How do we know? Take Action: Look to other disciplines (psychology, marketing, etc. to inform your approach to cybersecurity awareness. Who, internally or externally, can assist you? Take Action: The content alone cannot drive a cybersecurity awareness strategy. Evaluate your program. Is it a campaign or isolated modules? Does it have a brand?
