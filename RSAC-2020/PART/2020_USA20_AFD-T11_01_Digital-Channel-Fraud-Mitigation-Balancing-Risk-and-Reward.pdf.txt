The hub has emerged as a key area of focus

#RSAC
Key trends driving interest in hubs
· Automation of attacks: Criminals are using bots to help speed their path to monetization of stolen data.
· FIs struggle to respond nimbly: Business cases, IT resource queues, and vendor risk management processes all slow FIs' ability to quickly adjust their fraud and authentication routines.

· Pressure to reduce friction: Amid the rising threat environment, customer experience remains the #1 business case driver.

Key takeaways
· Faster payments requires faster decisioning--and interdiction
· Banks need to invest to protect the customer from themselves as social engineering attacks continue to scale.
· FIs need to get more nimble--hubs can help
· Collaboration is also key--the bad guys collaborate the good guys need to do so as well
