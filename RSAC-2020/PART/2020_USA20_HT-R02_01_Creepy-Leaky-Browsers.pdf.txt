Then... and now.

#RSAC
What is Browser Fingerprinting?
A combination of persistent and nonpersistent identifiers gathered passively through application programming interfaces built into modern web browsers.
APIs developed by standards bodies such as W3C define what data attributes browsers should support in order to facilitate seamless cross-platform experiences.

Why Are Browser Fingerprints Used?
Digital Marketing ­ Online advertisers and merchants utilize fingerprints to target individuals online with digital marketing campaigns. User Experience ­ Web developers and designers use fingerprints for analytics to build sites that provide a consistent user experience across platforms. Return Device Recognition ­ Many organizations (B2B & B2C) utilize browser fingerprints to recognize users that are returning to use their product or service online. Fraud Prevention ­ Banks & Merchants use browser fingerprints to detect and mitigate fraud attacks against their customers.
