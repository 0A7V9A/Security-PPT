Risk Assessment
(Key Terms)

The probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss associated with a specific
event
Source: Risk Analysis (O-RA), an Open Group Standard (C13G), October 2013 www.opengroup.org/library/c13g

that is made

#RSAC
Risk Assessment
(Key Questions)

· Identify assets of value and possible loss events that may materialize ­ "Where/What?"
· Describe the action of a threat onto an asset and the effect (loss event scenario) ­ "How?"

· Gather data and analyze factors of loss event scenarios ­ "How much?"
· Estimate the effect of changes to certain risk factors ­ "How much more/less if?"

Data

What do the experts say about data?

Doug Hubbard

· Your problem is not as unique as you think · You have more data than you think · You need less data than you think · An adequate amount of new data is more
accessible than you think

Jack Jones

· Calibration methods enable subject matter experts to provide good estimates
· Many organizations are awash in data from the security technologies that they use
· Many organizations have processes in place that can be useful sources of data

Risk Assessment Requirement
Recommends articulating risk scenarios and providing decision makers with probabilities, ranges of loss, and confidence levels...based on all
risk profile data, define a set of risk indicators that allow the quick identification and monitoring of current risk and risk trends
Establish and maintain certain information security risk criteria...the value of the identified assets in terms of their confidentiality, integrity and availability...the threats and vulnerabilities that affect the security of those assets...the impact on the organization should the assets be
compromised; and the likelihood of them being compromised
The organization...analyzes the operational environment in order to discern the likelihood of a cybersecurity event and the impact that the
event could have on the organization...use cyber threat information from internal and external sources

Wrapping things up

Troubleshooting your risk assessment
No one seems to care
­ Have you tossed the heat map? Still calling findings risk? ­ Is cyber risk represented as a probability distribution? ­ Are decision makers seeing a variety of vetted risk response options?
No idea what to do next
­ Have you mapped assets? What's the loss event scenario? ­ Are factors of frequency and magnitude documented? ­ Did you revisit the loss event scenario?
Not used for a strategic decision
­ Are you comparing cost vs. risk reduction benefit? ­ Is there demand for this approach? ­ Is your team ready to jump into the decision-making process?
Cannot aggregate assessments
­ Is there an enterprise loss event taxonomy? ­ Are quantitative ranges estimated before qualitative reporting labels?

Recap

Your risk assessment procedure should include...

· Steps for "Where/What?", "How?", "How much?", "How much more/less if?"
· Mapping to external requirements

Your risk assessment report should include...

· Answers to "Where/What?", "How?", "How much?", "How much more/less if?"
· How meets external requirements

Now you can...

· Better assign resources & prioritize budget · Provide value with compliance

50

#RSAC
Applying what you've learned

Apply it

By next month... By summer vacation...

· Identify critical assets and their value · Document loss event factors · Identify external requirements
· "Shop" for data · Analyze loss event factors and response options · Map to external requirements

Before end of year...

· Expand scope
