The Challenge
"Security teams must ensure business travelers understand they have no inherent right to privacy while traveling, that most network operators conduct at least superficial surveillance campaigns on all foreign travelers, and the use of certain applications and websites will trigger in-depth surveillance for travelers."
­ Aaron Turner, IANS -Ensure Traveling Users Understand and Mitigate Potential Infosec Risks

#RSAC
Triage Concerns
Is the data and information contained within the device worth more than the device itself? What are the local laws in the country being entered? What is the result to both the individual and the organization if All DATA on the device were compromised or released? What is the effect of device encryption?
11

#RSAC
Encryption Vulnerabilities Exposed at the Border
Forced decryption and drive backup Restrictions against importing encryption into foreign country License required for export from U.S. for certain high powered encryption/cryptography Controlled technology taken out of the country while encrypted, is STILL controlled!

Practical Risk-Based Solutions

#RSAC
5 Risk-Based Questions
What is on the device? Who owns it? How is it being used and secured? Why is it needed overseas? Where will it be located and for how long?
19

#RSAC
What is on It?
PCI PHI PII Unpublished research data Export controlled technology Encryption NDA's and 3rd party data
20

What is on the Device and Why?
Commercial Off the Shelf Software (COTS) OR proprietary/unreleased software Unpublished Research Data Adjusted Peak Performance (APP) Hardware - Specialty laptops and equipment may require a license Radiation hardened or protected from extreme elements High performance computers Software and Encryption ­ may need a license Encryption software with symmetric key length of 64-bits or higher Controlled Software Military support applications Export-controlled technical data Best to back-up on a secure system and remove from laptop prior to travel
21

#RSAC
Technology Review Steps
Classify the technology or goods involved (ITAR, EAR, OFAC, other?) Determine if license is needed for the technology/end user/end use Determine if license exception is available Document the use of the exception

US Commerce Control List
Laptops, iPhones, Blackberries: 5A992 Mass market software (Windows, OS X, Office, Adobe products, Visual Studio): 5D992 Open source software (Linux, Apache): 5D002
23

#RSAC
Are Licenses for Import OR Export Required?
Is a license required for taking this information out of the country? Is a license required for taking this hardware out of the country? Do I know the rules for entering my destination country as well as planned and potential layover countries?
24

#RSAC
Who is Traveling and Why Do They Need It?
Must document the need Only for convenience? What is the minimum they need for that purpose? What mitigating alternatives are available? Pre-travel steps including surveys and training
25

#RSAC
Where is it Going? (Planned and Unplanned)
If you must travel to one of the five embargoed countries, you may be able to obtain the appropriate export license, but the process can take, on average, a ninety days for review. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) within Dept. of Treasury accept applications for licenses to export encryption products and technologies.

#RSAC
Pre-Travel Briefings
Pre-Travel Surveys Guides Notice forms Signed acknowledgement forms Travel Letters Classify data and hardware
27

#RSAC
Training the Traveler
A bulletproof program fails if no one uses it Organizations providing "solutions" result in travelers reaching out in advance with questions Inconvenience provides an opportunity to train on new devices Awareness sometimes begin with non-technical questions A travelogue on sites to see and photo tips can lead to a travel device
