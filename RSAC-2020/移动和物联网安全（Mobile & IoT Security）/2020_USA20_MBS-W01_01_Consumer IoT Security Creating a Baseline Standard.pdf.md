Progress in "smart" consumer product security

ETSI TS 103 645 EN 303 645
Consensus-based, open standard

Upcoming UK Regulation
Baseline requirements in new law
Product assurance
UL, BSI, IoTSF etc.
Other consumer IOT security initiatives

If you'll remember only one thing...
good consumer IoT security = 103 645

Insecure consumer IoT threatens:
Our privacy / safety Third parties (DDoS)

#RSAC
Infrastructure

IoT manufacturers:
­ "My organization is new to cyber security - where to begin?" ­ "There is a jungle of guidance out there, with no common baseline."

#RSAC
The ETSI standard
Technical Specification (TS) 103 645 / draft European Standard (EN) 303 645

#RSAC
Why technical standards?
Negotiated through a SDO in an inclusive process
Why ETSI?
­ Develops globally-applicable standards for digital systems ­ 850 member organizations from 65 countries. A special role in Europe. ­ All standards are free to download
It's hard to get IoT standards right:
­ Cover all consumer IoT vs. specific verticals? ­ Just the essentials vs. aiming for 100% security? ­ Outcome-focused vs. prescriptive?

#RSAC
TS 103 645 / EN 303 645: development
Guiding principles:
­ Is it sufficiently important? ­ Are we placing an acceptable burden on small businesses? ­ Are we accommodating future innovation? ­ Is it appropriate for the full spectrum of consumer IoT?
Based on well-established guidance, including:
­ UK Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security (2018) ­ German DIN SPEC 27072 (2019)

TS 103 645 / EN 303 645: content

TS 103 645 v1 published in February 2019
Currently developed as EN 303 645. Latest public draft: November 2019
(free download)

10) Examine system telemetry data

11) Make it easy for consumers to delete personal
data

12) Make installation and maintenance of devices easy

13) Validate input
data

9) Make systems
resilient to outages

1) No universal
default passwords

2) Implement a
means to manage reports of vulnerabilities

3) Keep software
updated

4) Securely store credentials and security-sensitive
data

8) Ensure that personal data is protected

7) Ensure software
integrity

6) Minimise exposed attack surfaces

5) Communicate securely

Reception
"ANEC trusts it will become the landmark specification for consumers and industry alike." "IoT Security Foundation welcomes the ETSI announcement as a significant and important development." "It is testament to the international consensus on what needs to be done to ensure consumers all around the world can feel their internet-connected devices are safe and secure to use." "If we are to deliver the very real benefits that IoT can make to people's life's we must address these justified concerns and therefore welcome the publication of the ETSI standard."

Uptake in product assurance schemes
"Finland becomes the first European country to certify safe smart devices ... The Cybersecurity label can be awarded to networking smart devices if the devices meet the certification criteria, which are based on EN 303 645."
"UL's IoT Security Rating framework aligns with prominent industry standards, including ETSI TS
103 645"
"BSI Kitemark certification for Internet of Things connected devices is now based on the newly published ETSI TS 103 645 specification."
"DTG are launching a `Secure by Design' cyber security conformance scheme [for smart TVs]. The conformance specifications will be developed based on the [...] ETSI TS 103 645."
"IASME has defined a set of 30 checks which can be verified by a national network of certifying
bodies." [Mapped to TS 103 645 v1.1.1]
"IoTSF has published a mapping document which translates the high-level provisions of ETSI TS 103 645 to the more detailed requirements contained in the IoT Security Compliance Framework"

#RSAC
Next steps
Europe-wide consultation on EN 303 645 just closed
Publication expected in summer 2020
TS 103 645 to be the most up to date version, with updates to the EN made in slower time
The standard is expected to influence:
­ Europe-wide certification schemes under the EU Cybersecurity Act ­ Potential Europe-wide regulation under the EU Radio Equipment Directive ­ National laws, such as in the UK ­ Assurance and certification schemes

#RSAC
UK regulation on consumer IoT security

#RSAC
Regulation is needed
Despite much guidance, bad practice remains widespread It's hard to get regulation right:
­ Risk of unintended consequences ­ Need to make it futureproof ­ Enforcement? Liability?
California IoT security Bill SB-327
­ Important first step
US IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019
­ Will it protect consumers?

#RSAC
UK regulation development
May 2019: public consultation
January 2020: government response
Our intention is to require all "smart" consumer products sold in the UK to meet basic requirements
New legislation is now being prepared

#RSAC
Draft proposals for mandated requirements in the UK
1. Where passwords are used, all device passwords shall be unique per device or defined by the user, unless:
a) the device is in a pre-initialized state in which network connectivity and functionality are limited to those that are needed for the user to set a password or another authentication method.
(ETSI draft EN 303 645 provision 4.1-1)
2. A vulnerability disclosure policy shall be publicly available that is clear and transparent. This policy shall provide a process that allows for issues to be reported in an accessible way and include, at a minimum:
a) contact information; and b) information on timelines for (1) initial acknowledgement of receipt and (2) status
updates until resolution of the reported concern. (ETSI draft EN 303 645 provision 4.2-1)
3. The defined support period for security updates shall be published at the point of sale in an accessible way that is clear and transparent.
(ETSI draft EN 303 645 provision 4.3-8)
