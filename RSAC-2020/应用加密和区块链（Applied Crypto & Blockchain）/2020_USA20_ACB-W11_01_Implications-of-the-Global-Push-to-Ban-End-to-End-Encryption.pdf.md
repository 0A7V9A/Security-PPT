Recap

Continuing tension between security
and liberty.

Security for whom?

Means and ends: good intent bad
outcomes.

Need to reconcile in a new world, different rules...

...and avoid the slippery slope to authoritarianism.

Key principles: privacy, security, trust.

The counter movement: technology, governance
and norms.

What to Do
NEXT week
Consider ways your company's policies are being affected by differences in national encryption regimes

In the first
THREE
months
Seek out and adopt privacy and security enhancing tools-- normalize their use
Work to educate colleagues and partners on the need for strong encryption

#RSAC
In the next
SIX
months
Support the development of strong encryption Engage in the heavy lifting of democracy
