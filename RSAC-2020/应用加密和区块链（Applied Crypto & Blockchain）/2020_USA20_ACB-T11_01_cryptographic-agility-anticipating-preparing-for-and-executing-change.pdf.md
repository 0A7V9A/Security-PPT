Cryptographic Agility: Addressing Change
Technology advancements and more sophisticated cryptanalysis empower attackers and increase threat levels
Ex: Improvements in hash collision finding, future quantum computers
Cryptography needs to change over time
Algorithms become deprecated and need removal New primitives and algorithms are introduced Larger key/signature/ciphertext sizes are needed Alternative parameter sets are introduced
Cryptographic Agility: a capability allowing us to make smooth transitions between algorithms and configurations

Cryptographic Agility: Discussion Topics
1. In the applications, products, or services your organization deploys, produces or provides, what does crypto agility mean and how has it been handled?
2. What have we learned from cryptography transitions in the past, and how might this motivate improvements?
3. What are the major challenges in dealing with transitions, for example, from the current adopted cryptosystems to new quantumresistant algorithms? Possible technical paths for transition?
4. What strategies which you think might improve cryptographic agility?

Cryptographic Agility: What Can You Do Today
Build and maintain an inventory of current uses of cryptography in your systems and applications.
­ Include algorithms, parameters, key sizes, protocols, etc.
Test transition ahead of time.
­ For PQC, you can use Open Quantum Safe (OQS, https://openquantumsafe.org/) implementations to test candidate algorithms and PQC-enabled protocols.
Ask your suppliers for details on how they provide cryptographic agility in their systems and services. Participate in industry forums discussing cryptography transition and the frameworks that will enable it.
­ E.g., NIST PQC, IETF work on TLS hybrids
