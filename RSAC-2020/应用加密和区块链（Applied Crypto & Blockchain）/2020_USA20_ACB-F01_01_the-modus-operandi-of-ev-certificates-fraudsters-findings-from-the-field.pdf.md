Key Principals of the Approach Generate and employ empirical evidence to:
- Identify online threats and vulnerabilities and educate targets of cybercrime
- Guide policy development and guardians' efforts to secure cyberspace
- Guide the design and configuration of computing environments that can mitigate effectively the consequences cybercrime events

In Sum,
It is possible to buy valid EV certificates on the dark web for completely fictional companies Vendors are tricking CAs by obtaining official governmental and fraudulent documentation Those offering EV certificates alone (asking price ranges between $1,000-$15,000), rather than as bundled packages (asking price ranges between $100-$400), charge more for EV certificates and appear to be more likely to deliver

#RSAC
In sum (cont.),
Obtaining certificates for financial services organization (asking price ranges between $10,000-$15,000) is more costly than gaining one for a retail website (asking price ranges between $1000-$1500).
At least one vendor selling EV certificates is working as part of a sophisticated organized crime group which operates across several countries across the world and communicate with agents of the Certificate Authorities directly.

#RSAC
Apply it: Certificate Authorities
Certificate Authorities should do more to validate the authenticity of individuals and organizations who purchase EV certificates, while keeping an eye on the cybercrime ecosystem and the key actors who have interest in obtaining these certificates for both their legitimate and illegitimate activities
