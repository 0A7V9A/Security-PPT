What the Business Wants
Risk Management

Cyber Resiliency

Compliance

Revenue/Cost

Objective defense of IT investment against cyber
security

Assurance of compliance policies and procedures

To move quickly against the competition

Realtime Risk Assessment Reporting against DevSecOps

· What is our compliance risk? · Can we recover quickly in case of a breach? · Where is DevSecOps a blocker to revenue?

#RSAC
Now it is time to take an Action
Immediate Action: Start tracking risk as a first order citizen
­ Inject security requirements based on business risk tolerance ­ Report on risk (requirements partially or not met at all) ­ Move to dual attestation (human testing and automated testing)
15

#RSAC
Now it is time to take an Action
Over the next 90 days: Focus on the architecture
­ Integrate DevSecOps lifecycle with Business Risk Assessment through a Policy to Procedure layer
­ Map standards and frameworks to solution architecture archetypes for lightweight threat modeling in common use cases
­ Automate generation of audit reports that measure solution requirements against standards/regulations
­ Set go/no-go deployment policies based on business risk tolerance ­ Move toward consistent, quantitative risk assessment (OpenFAIR for
example)
