Product Intelligence
Single Number Relative to Others

Specific Actions to Take

Historical Trend

1. Findings and Vulnerabilities (45%) 2. Security Services (35%) 3. Security Culture (10%) 4. Security Incidents (10%)

On time closure (e.g. audit findings, pen test findings) Must use required services (e.g. penetration testing) e.g. Security Ninja appointed and attending trainings e.g. Product has been root cause of a security incident
