A Public Health Problem

Challenge ­ Tens of Thousands of Devices
 Little or no security built in  Legacy platforms  Patching  Mobility  Communication and oversight gaps  Physical teams v. IT security  Connected to networks  Vetting of devices

The Challenge
Over next 10 years 100 Billion Exposures Between patients and connected medical devices
People ·1 billion healthcare visits ·1.5 M nursing home residents
Places ·6,000 hospitals ·17,000 nursing homes

Estimating patient exposures to digitally enabled and networked medical devices

1. One billion patient encounters per year
2. Estimate each encounter, on average, has 10 exposures to a medical device
3. Assume 10 years of legacy risk as the national healthcare landscape will continue to have inadequately secured devices
4. Over ten years, 100 billion patient exposures with medical devices

What is Needed
Three parameters define the importance of a public health problem · Breadth of exposure, e.g. incidence/prevalence · Depth of impact, e.g. morbidity and mortality · Preventability
Clear definitions for security risks and medical device associated adverse events Develop methods to establish valid estimates for the prevalence and incidence of malware and other security breaches in medical devices and associated impact on patient outcomes Identify, track, and trend security incidents based on a model that protects the interests of patients, providers, manufacturers and regulators

MD-VIPER
The MD-VIPER Vulnerability Report is designed to serve as an alternate reporting process to FDA's requirements for 21 CFR Part 806 reporting if cybersecurity vulnerabilities are involved.
Manufacturers are not held to 21 CFR Part 806 reporting requirements if:
the manufacturer is a active participant in an ISAO (NH-ISAC)
the manufacturer is conducting a correction/removal to address a cybersecurity vulnerability
the cybersecurity vulnerability in question has not led to any known serious injuries or deaths
the manufacturer will meet the timeline criteria for communicating to its customers and then validating and distributing the deployable fix such that the residual risk is brought to an acceptable level

Participation in MD-VIPER
· Open to all medical device security stakeholders · Free and voluntary* · Tracking each event (submissions, data sharing event,
communication event, etc.) · Each event is triggered by the manufacturer · Collaboration with manufacturer · Responsible sharing of information regarding
vulnerabilities and threats in light of specified vulnerabilities for stakeholder awareness
*Need to register and sign NDA

MD-VIPER Reporting Process
· Vulnerability reporter contacts MD-VIPER · Conversation between reporter and MD-VIPER · Reporter proceeds with sharing of vulnerability · Once reported, all data is stationary until a data
owner, manufacturer, advises in writing to share the data · If a third party shares the data, they should be able to advise us, in writing, to share the data

Case Study WannaCry

WannaCry
· On May 12, 2017, 4:00am ET multiple companies in Europe started reporting massive ransomware infections several hospitals within the National Health System Trust (NHS) in the UK have their phones systems disabled, turn away patients and cancel surgeries.
· This new ransomware variant is called "WannaCry / WCry / WanaCrypt0r".

The Facts
· As of 5/22/17 the ransom campaign stands at approximately 296 payments across 3 bitcoin wallets totaling 49 BTC or $104k.
· Ransomware spread using an SMB vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft in March 2017. Microsoft took the extraordinary step to send out a patch to Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 versions of software.
· Ransomware sought vulnerable machines over port TCP 445. No infections were seen coming from email or phishing or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

For WannaCry Mitigation Strategies

Mitigation Strategies
· Ensure all patches are up to date. Microsoft has patches available for all software versions Microsoft XP and higher.
· Issue a companywide communications putting all staff on high alert.
· Prevent delivery and download of .exe attachments both direct and contained inside zip files.
· Ensure SMB (disable ports 139 and especially 445) is not permitted into your environment from external sources. Note especially 3rd party VPN connections.

Mitigation Strategies
· Apply anti-virus patches, many new updates provided since May 12th.
· Block attempts to communicate to unauthorized and new domains.
· Detect/block known hashes. There are multiple lists, including those shared with NH-ISAC membership.
· Review the list of IP hits against the sinkholed domain keeping in mind some positive hits might be from your own security team.
· Continue to share and participate on NH-ISAC forums.
