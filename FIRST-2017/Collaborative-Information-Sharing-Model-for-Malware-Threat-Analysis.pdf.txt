under
Malware Mitigation Working Group
Copyright © 2016 CyberSecurity Malaysia

The project
Malware Mitigation Project
A collaboration within APCERT/OIC-CERT/Partners members to share malware threat, analysis, response and mitigation against cyber threat
attacks
To conduct research in malware threats analysis with information sharing among participating members
· Provide an overview of cyber threats landscape and to have a workable solution by doing collaborative research to mitigate the
cyber threats · Sharing regular report/data on the malware attacks and focus on
the impact analysis and remedial action

DATA from LebahNet

TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT WILL BE CAPTURED BY LEBAHNET SENSORS

Malware

Remote access login attempt (SSH, Telnet, etc.)

MONITORING

SENSOR

USER / PARTICIPATION

For monitoring threats from the Public / Internet, the sensor will require public IP (or mapped from public IP) with allow ANY incoming ports configure from Firewall.
For monitoring threats from the Internal (LAN / VLAN / Secured), the sensor will require internal IP related to the segment being monitored with allow ANY incoming ports configure from Firewall.

The sensor will be prepared in two (2) forms, a Physical box and a Virtual Machine. Participant can choose either form suite to their
environment.

Participant have to allow information sending through secured protocol (HTTPS 443/TCP) over the Internet between the sensor and MyCERT centralized server (api.honeynet.org.my).
User/Participant will have access to their dedicated Dashboard that require access credential.
