Good News: this can be business as usual process

Venafi Maturity Roadmap for TLS/SSL
Roadmap: Control of Machine Identities

Level 0:
Chaos
Have unquantified security risk, outages, expensive and
manual processes, and compliance challenges

Level 1:
Control
Build a security foundation with focus on known and trusted keys and certificates

Level 2:
Critical Systems
Secure and protect all keys and certificates on
business-critical infrastructure

Level 3:
Enterprise Protection
Protect and automate all keys and certificates
enterprise-wide and further
reduce costs and extract
more business value

Level 4:
Machine Identity Protection
Rapidly respond to
internal and external
threats and security
incidents related to keys
and certificates
