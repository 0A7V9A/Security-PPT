Security?

Security Test?

So What?
Why does PSIRT care?

5 things people HATE about DevOps
1. Everyone thinks it's all about Automation.
2. "True" DevOps apparently have no processes - because DevOps takes care of that.
3. The Emergence of the "DevOps' DevOp", a pseudo intellectual loudly spewing theories about distantly unrelated fields that are entirely irrelevant and speaking at conferences.
4. People constantly pointing to Etsy, Facebook & Netflix as DevOps. Let's promote the stories of companies that better represent the market at large.
5. Lack of fit for anyone who is not in a Dev or Ops role.

A DevOps culture
1. Things move fast 2. Small pieces of work checked in
often 3. Autonomous teams with
transparency; No silos 4. Building quality into the
development process 5. Feedback / eliminate blame /
embrace failure 6. Automation

Security culture
"What happens {with security} when people
are left to their own devices."
--Tim Ferriss

1. Application security is about the people.
2. The people introduce the vulnerabilities.
3. Security in DevOps must change the people.

Defining features of a sustainable DevOps security culture

Deliberate and
disruptive

Eliminate Security Blame

Building Quality AND Security In

Security

No security

Transparency

silo

How do we embed a culture of security?

Culture Hacking

Community

Automation

Security behavior
Light weight

Easily repeatable

Security Behavior ­ a manner of behaving that
decreases danger, risk, or threat

Well defined

Why and ROI

Clear start and finish
point

Security behavior vs. security process
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3

Security habits

Reminder

Routine

Reward

Build security in
Security best practices

Desired Outcome
· A wide spread attitude / culture change
· Consideration of security best practices early

Habit Generation
· Explain WHY they should care
· Demonstrate how best practices are done
· Understand the negative case, or not doing them

Uncover design security problems
Threat modeling

Desired Outcome
· Choose the design decision that protects the confidentiality and integrity of customer data

Habit Generation
· Show developers how to create a threat model
· Quickly move to threat modeling an active design on which they are working
· Enable the security light bulb

React to automated security bugs

Static analysis

Dynamic analysis

Vulnerability scanning

Desired Outcome
· Interpret automated security notifications as a gift and not a curse

Habit Generation
· Position the interruption as close to the dev as possible (IDE based SA)
· Aggressively limit false positives ­ do not scan for everything in the beginning

Detect security flaws in other's code
Security code review

Desired Outcome
· Find the errors in the code that could be exploited if they reach production (those missed by automated scans)

Habit Generation
· Force a security code review in the code commit process
· Require a security +1 for each check-in
· Teach your developers the fundamental security lessons of their languages, and how to find those issues in code

Eradicate 3rd party software vuln's
3rd Party SW / Dependency
Checking

Desired Outcome
· Eliminate known vulnerable components at deploy time

Habit Generation · Break the build on a
dependency checker failure

Be mean to your code
Red Teaming

Desired Outcome
· Uncover flaws using active testing, fix those flaws, and push the fixes to production as fast as possible.

Habit Generation
· Instill the idea that your code will be attacked
· Provide the time and tools for everyone to spend time attacking

Respond in a timely and organized fashion
PSIRT

Desired Outcome
· Partnership between dev and PSIRT to alleviate any security bugs in the shortest amount of time possible

Habit Generation · Talk to and educate
developers about the PSIRT mission

Summary

Security Behaviors for DevOps

Build Security In Uncover design security problems React to automated security bugs

Detect security flaws in other's code

Eradicate 3rd party software vuln's

Be mean to your code

Respond in a timely and organized fashion

Security behaviors through security community

People

Monthly Training

Security Days

Internal Capture the
Flag

Conferences

Build a security [advocate, guild, champion] program

Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Next week: ­ Assess your organizational DevOps and security culture ­ Survey DevOps population to gauge response to security
 In the first three months: ­ Prioritize security behaviors and form a plan ­ Focus on the security behavior that is your top priority and invest in making it successful
 Within six months: ­ Branch out to your top three security behaviors and focus in
 Within one year: ­ Roll out all the security behaviors

Key takeaways
1. Just call it DevOps and focus on making security a natural part of building stuff.
2. Security behaviors embed security without all the overhead.
3. Security community bolsters security behavior.
