The "R" in PSIRT

Do you have a statement?

Am I at risk?

No response is a response.

Where's my CVE?
What are you doing about it?

Establish Metrics
Data
· Plentiful · Does not change behavior

A Good Metric is:
· Simple · Comparative · Behavior Changing

The difference between what can be counted and what

really counts separates data from metrics.

Key Data Driving "R"-enabling Metrics
Impact Assessment · Many products with different attributes across multiple business units · Critical to understand scope of impact for you and your customers

Fix Plan Ready

· For publicly known vulnerabilities, customers want fix release date · Delayed fix plan results in agitated customers and business execs

Fix Date - Planned · Planned date when fix will be released to your customers · Important to track weekly to understand added risks as plans change

Fix Release - Actual · Measure actual performance of development teams · Address schedule misses by performing lessons learned

The more time that passes between logging the issue and understanding scope of impact, the greater the risk that fixes will be extremely slow in coming.

How Dashboards Help Management

· Red/Yellow/Green coding quick and easy to grasp

· Case volume could indicate intrinsic product security problems - or not

· Trend changes week to week by using  and  arrows

· Investigate poor/declining metrics with team to uncover problem areas

­ Issue owner sick or on vacation with no backup?

­ Unbalanced resource

­ Suppliers are slow to respond

­ Priorities out of order

­ Development missing target dates

­ Unnecessary process gates

­ Other teams not providing adequate support

· Celebrate successes!

Hmmm?

No Metrics? No Problem!

­ Does not change behavior
· Measure responsiveness at various points in the total timeline to uncover potential risks.
­ Impact assessment ­ Fix Plan ­ Fix Date ­ Planned ­ Fix Release ­ Actual
· Establish SLOs that drive your teams to achieve your company's definition of success. · Construct a simple dashboard to keep management engaged and informed.
