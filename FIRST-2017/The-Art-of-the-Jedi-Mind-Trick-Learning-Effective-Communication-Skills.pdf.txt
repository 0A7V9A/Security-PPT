NOW LET'S LEARN A FEW JEDI MIND TRICKS!

INTRODUCTION
What to expect from this workshop

WHY IS COMMUNICATION SO HARD?

EVERYONE'S TALKING

CLEARLY SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING

SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY

PART OF THE PROBLEM

CAN WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

IF YOU ARE NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION
YOU ARE THE PROBLEM

THE FORCE AWAKENS

KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE

KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
· Do your homework · Open Source Intelligence (e.g. Google them) · What type of Business? · Look for indicators
· Personality · Corporate culture · Chain of command

AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION

ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE
· Tell a joke · Tell a story · Icebreakers
· The Name game · If you were an animal, what would you be? · Favorite book, movie, TV show, video game · Audience Participation · Get them talking

LISTEN

LISTEN
· Verbal Cues · Tone of voice · Types of questions they are asking · Assent
· Non-Verbal Cues · Body Language · Facial Expressions · Posture · Are they checking their mobile device? · Are they awake?

LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
The Art of the Jedi Mind Trick

LEARN TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE
· Understand the drivers · Avoid (or not) hot buttons · Respect earns trust · Restate if necessary · Don't give up · Pick your battles

BECOME BILINGUAL
· Lean their language · Speak their language · Put what you are trying to convey in their terms · Don't shout · Don't slow down · They will not learn your language ­ you must learn
theirs

TELL STORIES

TELL STORIES

· Share your experience · Common themes · You are not alone · Outrunning the bear
· Analogies · Military · Sports · Entertainment · Politics/Current Events

· Avoid Colloquialisms · Pay attention to geography
· Part of the Country · Foreign Country · Cultural Landmines · If at first you don't succeed...

SIMPLIFY

SIMPLIFY
· Seek Understanding over technical accuracy · Get the major points across · You're not trying to create an expert · Seek a basic understanding so an informed decision can be
made · Ask your audience what they heard
· Make them explain it back to you · Be prepared to try again · Lather, Rinse, Repeat

LEARN THE BUSINESS DRIVERS

LEARN THE BUSINESS DRIVERS
· Hint: most companies are trying to earn a profit · Put your message in business terms · Relate what you are trying to do back to business
drivers · Connect the dots for your audience

A COUPLE POINTERS
The Art of the Jedi Mind Trick

DON'T ASSUME UNDERSTANDING

DON'T CRUSH THEM

WHY DO WE CHOOSE TO SPEAK?

EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
A little bit art; a little bit science

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
The Art of the Jedi Mind Trick

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING

RECOMMENDATIONS
· Treat security as a puzzle not a game · Not the hacking part but the education and awareness part · There are often multiple solutions
· Learn to communicate better · Start by listening · Ask questions · Repeat back what you're hearing
· Build trust relationships (trust must be earned) · Perfect security is not the end game or desired state
· Compromise is okay · Pick Your battles

DON'T TREAT IT LIKE A GAME

CHANGE THE CULTURE

SUMMARY
Lead by example Be the change you want to see Understand the business problems Be confident but humble Earn trust Become bilingual Become a teacher Learn to listen

TREAT IT LIKE A PUZZLE

LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO
PRACTICE

GO, COMMUNICATE AND MAY THE FORCE
BE WITH YOU
