 More than once a year  Consistent messaging  Support from the top  Include everyone - did I
say consistent?

Realistic Simulations

#RSAC
 Is a SaaS going to meet your needs?
 How do you test and teach WITHOUT exploiting?
 Don't expect perfection  IMPORTANT ­ Reward the
positive, educate the negative  A good simulation will also set
your baseline

#RSAC
Effective Teaching Moments
Use your training time wisely and ask yourself:  When are you teaching the employee? (pre- or post-click)  Are you rewarding and reinforcing the positive?  Is safety a burden?  Does it make them safer in their personal lives as well?

#RSAC
Key Points To Remember
 Realistic simulations are proven to help increase awareness  Buy in must be from the top down  Do not exclude anyone  Use positive reinforcement of proper behavior  Do not ever expect 100% success ­ it's just not HUMAN
