 Clients and Employees may execute 100% of his activity with the bank remotely and from any device.
 We don't own all the infrastructure anymore (Clouds, Hybrid, etc.). And more ... not even the apps that use it !!
 How can we make this new world coexist with all of our legacy?  New ways of doing and use of new technologies to "build" Digital
Companies. (I.e. Agile methodology, DevOps, Big Data, etc.)

Lessons learned - Apply

#RSAC

 If your company is making a digital transformation  Don't bury your head in the sand, "just" ride the wave.

 Make sure the red lines you draw are real. Be consistent. Be honest. Open your mind.

 Shift "Security" state of mind to Trust Generator.
