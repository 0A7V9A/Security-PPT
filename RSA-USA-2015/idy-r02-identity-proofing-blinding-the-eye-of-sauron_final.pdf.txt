Identity Proofing 101
 A process that vets and verifies the information (e.g. identity history, credentials, documents) that is used to establish the identity of a system entity
 Considerations
 Remote vs. In-Person  Document collection and verification  Required data elements  Personally identifiable information  Maintenance and protection of information

Identity Proofing Components
 Identity Resolution  Identity Validation  Identity Verification

#RSAC
Identity Resolution
 Uniquely distinguishing an individual from all other people in a given context
 Requires
 Collection of attributes  Minimal amount of data that allows uniqueness to be determined  Consent to use attributes
Ensures that the smallest set of attributes have been resolved to a unique individual in a given population
4

#RSAC
Identity Validation
 Establishing the accuracy of the identity information via:
 An authoritative source  Corroborating different sources of information if no single authoritative
source is available
Ensures that identity information is accurate and timely
5

#RSAC
Identity Verification
 Confirming that the identity information provided relates to a specific individual
Ensures that the identity information is not being fraudulently used

Where Does This Put Us?
 ID Proofing is still a challenge for many organizations  Every organization is doing it themselves  Users are proofed multiple times  Your Proofing! = My Proofing  Customers are increasingly concerned about their privacy  Federated environments are decreasing the number of stores of
identity information  Hub architectures are reducing the barrier to federated identity

So What Are We Doing?
 Reviewing ways to establish and authenticate identity
 Recent technology development  Failures in remote proofing
 October 17, 2014 Executive Order Implementation Plan  Focus on identity proofing and identity assertions that are strong,
reliable, and privacy enhancing  NIST SP 800-63 released for review/comments:

#RSAC
How Are We Building It?

Meaningless But Unique Number (MBUN)  Unique among the CSP's and
users
 Protocols use an anonymous value as a requirement for the Subject

Persistent Anonymous Identifier (PAI)  NOT derived from MBUNs
 Created with the Java SecureRandom class
 Stored with MBUNs = Mapping

 Used to describe the value provided by CSPs as the Subject of the Authentication Response
 Specified by CSP

 Generated by Broker
 ID Broker Store: MBUN, iPAI
 Federation Manager Store: iPAI, rpPAI

Privacy By Design

#RSAC

13

#RSAC
There Is More To Do
 Broker infrastructure has access to attribute values sent from CSPs  Identity protocols are based on explicit trust and knowledge of endpoints  Encryption and signing requires knowledge of public keys = no longer
blind  Attributes are not persisted, but in-memory processing is an attack vector
for malicious actors  Double Blind is OK for data-at-rest, but not for data-in-motion  Attribute Encryption is not enough, risk remains where the Broker is
Honest-But-Curious, enforced only through policy. A malicious actor can bypass these controls and obtain read/write access to attribute data.  Impersonation Attacks

Summary
 Identity Proofing
 Identity Resolution  Identity Validation  Identity Verification
 Minimize the amount of data collected  Address privacy concerns  Leverage hub architectures

#RSAC
Applying the Blinders
 Analyze identity proofing requirements and the level of risk associated with what is being protected  Are they commensurate?
 Identify extraneous identity proofing requirements  Pinpoint critical data that may be targeted ­ Avoid honeypots  Implement mitigating elements, surveillance tools  New standards and profiles  Updated cryptography APIs  Increased market adoption
