 Lack of support for taking calculated risks

10
BS-BS

#RSAC
Where CISOs Fall Short ­ 2/2
 Emphasize risk elimination instead of risk optimization (`no' instead of `yes ­ if we ...')
 Even "risk enlightened" leaders are fixated on technology risks (focus on `IT' risk instead of `information' risk)
11

Using Existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program (or Create One)
 Leverage the existing enterprise risk management (ERM) program (if one exists).
 Information risk is a subset of enterprise risk.
 If there isn't an enterprise risk management program, sponsor one (position yourself to be CRO).
