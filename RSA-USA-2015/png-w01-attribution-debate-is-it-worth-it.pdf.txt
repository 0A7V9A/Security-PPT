Key Questions
 What do we mean by attribution ?  Do we need it or is it distracting us ?  To what extent is it a marketing trick ?  Does it help in detection / response ?  Does it help in threat assessment ?  What's the risk of false flags / misattribution ?  Can it provide reliable evidence for prosecution ?  Is this not something for the intelligence community ?
