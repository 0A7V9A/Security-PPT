What you can do...
 Establish C-Suite focus on network security risk management, crisis management planning, and incident response.
 Identify and prioritize what you are trying to protect, and develop a layered security approach accordingly.
 Integrate with others facing the same threats ­ join or establish threat sharing relationships with others in your sector and with the USG; identify and implement best network defense practices.
 Engage proactively with us when an incident does occur, including through early notification and robust interaction to identify, disrupt and deter the attackers.
