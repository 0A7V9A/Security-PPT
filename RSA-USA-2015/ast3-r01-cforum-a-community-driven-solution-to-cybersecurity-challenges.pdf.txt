U.S. Executive Order (EO) 13636 initiated a dialogue to identify challenges and determine effective responses. Industry responded to a NIST RFI:
 Trying to prioritize security activities without context seems like "Whack-a-Mole"
 IT Security budget is a zero-sum game; every dollar spent on compliance is a dollar not spent on riskmanagement
 Application of security controls needs to be scalable
 Challenge balancing performance and conformance
 Need for better risk dialogue with executive management

#RSAC
What is CForum?

 In the next few slides, we'll provide some details about CForum
 CForum continues the conversation started during the Cybersecurity Framework workshops as:
 a place to collaborate about measuring and improving cybersecurity  an environment for discussing emerging threats to cybersecurity
information and operation technology  a forum for thought leaders to share information

Community response and dialogue helped

#RSAC

refine the challenges and solutions

Framework Principles
· Flexibility · Global Impact · Risk Mgmt Approaches · Leverage Existing
Approaches, Standards, and Best Practices

Common Points
· Senior Mgmt Engagement · Understanding Threat
Environment · Business Risk Assessment · Separation of Business &
Operational Systems · Models / Levels of Maturity · Incident Response · Cybersecurity Workforce

Initial Gaps
· Metrics · Privacy / Civil Liberties · Tools · Dependencies · Industry Best Practices · Resiliency · Critical Infrastructure

We also need a common language to help

#RSAC

normalize and optimize activities

 Goal: Comply once ­ use many
 NIST identified >450 commonly used standards & practices
 Many of these share categories and families of controls in common
 Keeping up with multiple compliance frameworks is resource intensive and costly
 Need to express requirements and status to supply chain partners

For example: NIST SP 800-53 Control AC-3,
ISO 27002:2013 A.9.4.1, and IEC 15408 FDP_ACC.2 all point
to "access control" processes

The Cybersecurity Framework in Action:

#RSAC

An Intel Use Case

 Intel Corporation described how they used the Framework model to create a heat map for communicating and prioritizing cybersecurity activity among internal functional areas

AWWA Guidance and Cybersecurity Tool

American Water Works Association has developed Process Control System Security Guidance for the Water Sector and a supporting Cybersecurity Use-Case Tool.

The AWWA's cybersecurity resources are designed to provide actionable information for utility owner/operators based on their use of process control systems.

Homeland Security provides valuable

#RSAC

resources to apply the Framework model

 DHS Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) provides the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET)

 Numerous resources from the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community (C³) Voluntary Program

CForum provides a venue for sharing risk

#RSAC

information with other organizations

 ISACs and Sector Coordinating organizations use CForum to share information about emerging threats, and successful incident response methods
 Organizations can compare notes about how to characterize risks & threats
 Users should not share corporate or sensitive data, but general information can protect the community

Why re-invent the wheel? Leverage shared

#RSAC

templates to accelerate improvement

Presenter's Company Logo ­ replace on master slide

 Take advantage of lessons learned by others
 Jump start use of cybersecurity resources by using shared templates
 Identify opportunities for consistency within and across critical infrastructure sectors

#RSAC
Continue the conversation!

 Federal agencies are jump starting but aren't the longterm solution - management will eventually transfer to "Industry"

 Industry needs to own and lead cybersecurity management practices

 Businesses bring real-world understanding of the challenges and solutions

 Take advantage of the examples and lessons learned

 Help provide topics that speak the language of business
