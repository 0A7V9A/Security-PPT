Questions
 Why does InfoSec need to grow up?
 How do threats, regulations and business opportunities demand it?  What obstacles must we overcome?  How can we all get on the same page with foundational terminology?
 Do we need to be thinking more about risk (vs. Opsec)?
 How do we improve our (mental and formal) models?  How can we treat the risk landscape as a system, learning from Root
Cause Analysis?  How should we approach metrics to support good risk management?
Especially in light of social, mobile, cloud, CoIT, IoT, etc.?
 Looking back and looking forward: predictions for the future

#RSAC

(Evolve To Become The 2018 CISO Or Face Extinction, Andrew Rose, Forrester Research, Inc. (8/20/14))

 Preconceptions And An Addiction To Operations Draw Attention Away From Key Areas  Security leaders still tend to focus on technology  Security managers love the thrill of operational emergencies  S&R peer groups still value the CISSP above an MBA

 The Increasing Criticality of Information Will Lead To A Consolidation Of Roles  The CISO will become a privacy champion  All of IT compliance will come under the CISO's jurisdiction  Data governance will underpin the CISO's information risk practices

 Conclusion: CISO evolves into CIRO

Review
 Standardized nomenclature  Recognition that controls != risk
We need to improve our (mental and formal) models
 Recognition that the risk landscape is a system
How much risk we have today is a lagging indicator of how we've managed risk in the past (thru decisions and execution). Learning from effective root cause analysis is critical to improvement.
 Controls are necessary but not sufficient  Monitor & Measure  Empathy not attitude

Apply What You Have Learned
 Awareness of the problems (awareness that you have a problem is, after all, the first step)
 Awareness of different options for addressing the problems (resources, pros/cons)
 Metrics are super important
 Don't put too much import on CVSS or out of the box SIEM (vuln scores don't express risk without context)
 Steps they can take:
 Simple ways to evaluate what their organization is doing well/poorly on these issues  Simple steps for influencing change in their organizations
(e.g., facilitating internal discussion/adjustments)  Security leadership is needed! Develop your skills and plan for the future!
