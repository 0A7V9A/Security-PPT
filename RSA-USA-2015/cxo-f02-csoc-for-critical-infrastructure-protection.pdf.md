Why did we need CSOC?
7

#RSAC
Nation's Critical Infrastructure
 President's Executive Order (EO) 13636 - Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
 Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 21 - Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience
 Mayor of Los Angeles' Executive Directive No. 2 on Cybersecurity

#RSAC
Problem
 IT Security team is understaffed  Dispersed log capturing capabilities  Minimal use of collaboration tools  High value assets are not identified or tracked  Lack of Incident Management System and IR training  A threat intelligence program does not exist  Incident workflow process and procedures  Limited operational metrics  Heavy reliance on vendor auto-updating of security tools  Growing Cyber Threats

How did we sell it?
11

#RSAC
How did we sell it?
 Prepare to answer why you need CSOC  Security Audit Report (Recommendation and Action Plan)  Compliance Gap Assessment Report  Security metrics (numbers of intrusion attempts, incidents, outages caused by incidents, top attackers, threat activity and trends etc.  Present it from the business risk perspective
 Engage others outside of IT to also help sell it for us
 Provide potential risks of not implementing CSOC
 Provide real-world examples of cyber incidents and costs that your audience can relate to
 Provide source of funding for implementation and operations
 Align results to organizational goals
