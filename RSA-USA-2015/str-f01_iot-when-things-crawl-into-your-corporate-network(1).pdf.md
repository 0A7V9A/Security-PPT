Stop the FUD!

An approach to security for IoT

 Scope the problem and implications, without FUD!
 Define countermeasures:  Make sure short term fixes are possible (e.g. virtual patching)  Make sure processes exist to patch everything*
 Put the right trust models in place  Roots of trust  Mosaic (not chains) of trust  Complex policies that doesn't use a single, ever-present root  Complex authorization model  Granular enforcement model
 Cost of change curve: get it right now...  MQTT, XMPP, DDS, AMQP  Thread, AllJoyn  OIC, IIC, etc.

* Yes; everything

Addressing Automotive Cyber Systems

 Automotive "5-Star Capabilities"
 Safety by Design ­ Anticipate failure and plan mitigation  Third-Party Collaboration ­ Engage willing allies  Evidence Capture ­ Observe and learn from failure  Security Updates ­ Respond quickly to issues discoverer  Segmentation & Isolation ­ Prevent cascading failure
 This needs to apply to IoT too!

Implications for your company

#RSAC

This list should look familiar

 Perimeter... perimeter... perimeter...
 "You keep saying this word. I don't think it means what you think it means"
 If it's on its last legs now, it's annihilated with IoT:
 Drones  Wearables  Facilities, HVAC, etc.

 What's at risk...?  Corporate and National Espionage  IP Loss or damage  Privacy of employee, partner, customer  Availability of IT and basic services  Criminal and Civil Liability

26

#RSAC
Start with Risk / Benefits
 IoT is coming to the office  Unlike SmartPhones, they can't
be as easily turned off or left outside  There are benefits from welcoming it
28

#RSAC
What can we control?
 There is a need for spectrum monitoring, locally
 IoT storms: I-2-I, I-2-M, M-2-M (cascade)  Reflection and Amplification  CrowdFlash or attack?
 Qualities in things design
 Resilience  Application layer
29

#RSAC
Real "Intelligence" for security
 No ­ not about Big Data!  It is about...
 Authorization models  Speed  Object models (id, data/app, device)  Enforcement
 Interaction among authorizations models
 Intelligence (cognition) hubs  Opt-in  Opt-out
 Threat Intelligence and context  Personal threat intelligence services
30

Identity & Access Challenges
David Lake, Ammar Rayes, and Monique Morrow, Cisco (The Internet Protocol Journal, Volume 15, No. 3 - Sep 2012)
 It was hard for MF and then for distributed Enterprise environments...welcome to really hard!  Probabilistic not deterministic authorization  Machine learning, the pragmatic way (ok a little Big Data)
 Acting on a system, affects the system  Beware the Mirror Chess problem  Manage the contention between data access
 Concurrent multiparty/network security and privacy  Authenticate to multiple networks securely  Ensure that data is available to multiple endpoints  Manage privacy concerns among multiple consumers  Provide strong authentication and data protection that cannot be compromised

#RSAC
Can security really know you (and still respect privacy)?

31

The importance of privacy
 Privacy and the "cost of getting information about you"  Security only one input  Sampling your digital wake
 What is mine is mine...  Persistence of Identity  Inheritance of reputation
 Spying  Big brother (government)  Step brothers (other governments)  Little brother (companies)  Cousins (other people)
 De-personalization and Re-identification
32

#RSAC

Future research
 Patch Wars  Potential for better security with...
 Continuous, privacy-respecting monitoring  PFA, not MFA  Smart use of Machine Learning
 Non-Human object authentication and authorization  Virtual Patching  Sandboxing  Signal-to-noise: SIEM writ large  Centralized (dirigiste) Management  Retro-viruses?  Do we want to encourage genetic mutation and drift for resilience

Apply Slide

 Check your risk and threat assessments.
Do they cover IoT appliances? Do they balance risk vs. benefit? Think about liability, contracts and vendor Beef up "wireless" protocol monitoring and countermeasures

Everything is Under Control!

WINTER IS COMING!

 Prepare stakeholders, rather than be surprised
We've been reactive with Cloud and Mobility... time for a change Do your risk / benefit assessment Take a leaning forward approach to architectures now

You are here!

 Resistance is Futile...if you can't beat them...join them
IoT can be tremendously fun; show the business that you're on top of it Show the benefits of IoT: it opens new vistas for Human experience and new business opportunities

 Trust No One by Default
Don't make any assumptions about the security of IOT vendors Think about update cycles and what it takes to be sustainable in a world of constant hacks Think about roots of trust, authorization models and enforcement now

 Work with Peers, Partners and Vendors
Standards Regional and Vertical Groups Follow the 5-Star advice Rethink roots of trust and authorization ­ pressure vendors now
