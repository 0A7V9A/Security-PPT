When does the Constitution protect our privacy?
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." - Fourth Amendment (1791)

What happens when data leaves your possession?
Ex parte Jackson (1877) ­ the Constitution protects letters in transit, requiring the government to get a warrant from a judge to open a letter in transit through the postal system

technology?

Olmstead v. United States (1928) ­ the Constitution does not protect the privacy of phone calls in transit through the telephone network

#RSAC
Courts and Congress catch up.
· 1967: Supreme Court reverses Olmstead: voice in transit is protected by the Constitution
· 1968: Congress adopts the federal Wiretap Act - detailed procedures for issuing judicial warrants for interception of "wire or oral" communications in transit
· 1978: Congress adopts a parallel universe of rules for national security FISA

Disruptive technology ­ a second wave
1969 ­ CompuServe founded ­ Internet introduces non-voice comms and stored comms
1977 ­ Commercial cell phone service introduced
Problem: Wiretap Act only covered "wire" or "oral" comms and only in transit.

Congress responds again -

#RSAC

Electronic Communications Privacy Act 1986

 Required a warrant for all real-time access to content
 Cell phone conversations  Email and other electronic communications

 However, allowed access without a warrant to some stored communications and other stored data

#RSAC
Two new waves of disruptive technology
"The Cloud"  Under ECPA, many communications, documents and other items
stored with a service provider are available to the government with a mere subpoena ­ no court order required, no probable cause of criminal conduct Location  ECPA allows access to "records pertaining to a subscriber" without a judicial warrant and without a finding of probable cause

#RSAC
Warrant vs. subpoena ­ what's the diff?

#RSAC
Subpoena involves no prior judicial approval
10

#RSAC
The parallel universe ­ foreign intelligence collection
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  Warrants for surveillance inside the US, targeting persons inside the US  National Security Letters for stored metadata  Pen/trap provision for real-time collection of metadata  Warrants for physical searches  Section 215: Business records (sunsets June1, unless Congress acts)  Section 702 (aka "PRISM"): Programmatic approval of surveillance
targeting non-US persons reasonably believed to be outside the US

#RSAC
The courts begin to respond
 One federal appeals court requires warrant for all stored email (Warshak ­ 2010)
 Supreme Court requires warrant for prolonged GPS tracking ­ does not rule on cell tower data (Jones ­ 2012)
 Supreme Court declines to rule on NSA surveillance (Clapper ­ 2013, pre-Snowden)
 District courts rule on Section 215 program (2013, post-Snowden) ­ two for and one against; 3 appeals pending
