The Great Divide
2

#RSAC
Major Constraints on Ops and Security Teams
3

#RSAC
Attack-Defend Cycle (OODA Loop)
4

#RSAC
Most breaches exploit known vulnerabilities

80%

79%

ATTACKS
More than 80% of attacks target known vulnerabilities

PATCHES
79% of vulnerabilities have patches available on day of
disclosure

5

#RSAC

Security
Close Vulnerabilities
193 days to patch known vulnerabilities

Operations
Reduce downtime
80% of downtime due to misconfigurations

6

#RSAC
Laws of Vulnerabilities
 Half-Life ­ time interval for reducing occurrence of a vulnerability by half
 Prevalence ­ turnover rate of vulnerabilities in the "Top 20" list
 Persistence ­ total lifespan of vulnerabilities  Exploitation ­ time interval between an exploit
announcement and the first attack https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities
7

#RSAC
Half-Life
 29.5 Days
8

#RSAC
Prevalence
 8 critical vulnerabilities retained a constant presence in the Top 20
 Exploit Kits continuously target the same applications:
 Java Runtime Environment  Adobe Flash  Adobe Reader  Internet Explorer
9

#RSAC
Persistence
 Indefinite  Stabilize at 5-10%
10

#RSAC
Exploit Kits Increase Successful Attacks
 Average < 10 days  Critical < 48 hours  Exploit kits offer
money back guarantees

How to schedule vulnerabilities to be fixed using patches

#RSAC

#RSAC
How to select and schedule vulnerabilities that can be fixed using configuration packages.
Use a Config package
Configuration Packages
18

#RSAC
Job results for remediation group actions
Results
19

#RSAC
Morningstar Case Study
 Decreased configuration compliance audit cycle from 2 months to 5 days
 Reduced audit and patch time by 97%  Reduced compliance audit time from 5 days to 12 minutes per
system  Provided 100% SOX compliance
20

#RSAC
State of Michigan Case Study
 Heartbleed ­ vulnerability in OpenSSL
 Needed to quickly patch servers spread across the State
 Connected VM and Patch Management solutions to remediate Heartbleed in record time
21

#RSAC
Advantages of Bridging the Divide
 Significant decrease in configuration audit cycles  Significant reduction in approval and patch deployment time
frames  Reduce audit remediation from months to hours  Enhanced ability to report/communicate meaningful information to
business stakeholders
22

#RSAC
Bridging the Divide
 Arm the security and Ops teams with the right tools for the job
 Communicate vertically and horizontally within your Organization
 Essential to remove fear, uncertainty, and doubt  Embed security staff within key operational functions ­ e.g., CAB
23

#RSAC
Bridging the Divide (Cont)
 Orchestrate/automate infrastructure security
 Continuously enforce controls/changes  Validate changes through logs/audit trail
 Perform continuous compliance monitoring
 All systems all the time
 Automate remediation based on key triggers/risks
 If <trigger> then <action>
24

#RSAC
Bridging the Divide (Cont)
 Measure the security and Ops teams' performance by the half-life results & treatment of the persistence law
 Include results in HR performance reviews / bonuses
 Integrate VM/CM solution with patch & configuration management systems, asset inventory systems, ticketing systems, configuration systems (BMC BladeLogic / Chef / Puppet), and reporting systems
25

#RSAC
Bridging the Divide (Cont)
 Focus patching efforts on those things that will hurt you most
 Select a VM/CM solution with strong APIs, integration, and that limits resources spent on system administration
 Learn to speak the language of the Ops team
26

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Next week you should:
 Review the process by which vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are identified and delivered to your operations teams for action/remediation
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Identify opportunities to integrate threat and vulnerability systems with key operational systems (ticketing, CMDB, GRC, patch and configuration management)
 In cooperation with Ops, define a core set of "if-then" rules that will automatically trigger remediation
 Within six months you should:
 Define a set of agreed upon remediation metrics appropriate for different governance layers and begin tracking those metrics
 Automate 20% of your vulnerability and configuration management workflow
