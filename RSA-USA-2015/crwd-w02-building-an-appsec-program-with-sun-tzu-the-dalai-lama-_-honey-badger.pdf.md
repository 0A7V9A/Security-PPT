The Gold Standard Sun Tzu Quote for InfoSec
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
-Art of War, Chapter 3

Some Advice Too Many Take (Halfway) To Heart

"Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance" -Art of War, Chapter 1

Sun Tzu and Information

Security

#RSAC
Thinking "Security" Has An End
"What is essential in war is victory, not prolonged operations" Art of War, Chapter 2
13

#RSAC
Thoughts on "Capturing" Attackers
"In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, to, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them" Art of War, Chapter 3
14

#RSAC
Hacking Back
"One defends when his strength is inadequate, he attacks when it is abundant" Art of War, Chapter 4
"The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim" Art of War, Chapter 5
15

#RSAC
Security Through Obscurity
"Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness" Art of War, Chapter 6
16

#RSAC
Problems Communicating With "The Business"
"The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat: - let such a one be dismissed!" -Art of War, Chapter 1

Get Your Mind Right
"My true religion is Kindness" -Kindness, Clarity and Insight, 1984
"I feel that the essence of spiritual practice is your attitude toward others" -Catherine Ingram interview, 1988
22

#RSAC
Get Your Mind Right
 What are the true risks to your business?
 Physical, financial, strategic  Not just information assets
 How well are developers' activities aligned with the business
 Features, functions, timelines
23

#RSAC
Empathy and Compassion
"I believe all suffering is caused by ignorance" -Nobel acceptance speech, 1989
"Compassion and tolerance are not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength" -Words of Wisdom, 2001
24

#RSAC
Empathy and Compassion
 What are your developers actually doing?  Why are they doing it?  How can you support them and advance your goals?
25

#RSAC
Understand Developer Tools
 Coding (IDE)  Testing (Unit tests, acceptance tests)  Workload tracking (Defect trackers, change management)  Automation and orchestration (Continuous integration)  Metrics
26

#RSAC
Be Flexible and Data-Driven
"My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation" -The Universe in a Single Atom, 2005 "If science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong, then Buddhism will have to change. In my view, science and Buddhism share a search for the truth and for understanding reality. By learning from science about aspects of reality where its understanding may be more advanced, I believe that Buddhism enriches its own worldview" -New York Times, 2005
27

#RSAC
Be Flexible and Data-Driven
 What things are you doing "because we have always done it this way?"
 And how does that distort your budget and resourcing?
 What value are you getting from the technologies you have deployed?

29

#RSAC
Applying These Concepts
 When you get back to the office:
 Take a development manager to lunch  Find out how they manage their workload  Find out their big process/tool initiatives for the next quarter/year
 In the next 3-6 months:
 Run some lightweight metrics to see if your app security program "makes sense"
 Run some security "lunch and learn" events for developers
