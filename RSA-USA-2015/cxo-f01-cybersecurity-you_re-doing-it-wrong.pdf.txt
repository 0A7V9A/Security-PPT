Applying Effective Security

#RSAC

- A to Z

Getting it Right ­ Applying in Reality!

 Awareness is often the best return on investment  Business enablement and engagement will define your success  Culture can make or break security efforts ­ find out what `has worked' vs. `has not'  Do not try do it all! Prioritize, plan & deliver  Engage with sponsors & be the solution ­ not the `no' or barrier!  Focus on what really matters ­ people will forget non-essentials  Give options & practical solutions  Help others achieve their goals & objectives  Inform, interact and involve others in the decision process  Justify your role and the need for security  Know your strengths & weaknesses ­ play to strengths, build around weaknesses

Getting it Right ­ Applying in Reality! (cont)

 Learn from other mistakes & real world events  Manage expectations ­ you cannot stop every attack  New technologies do not necessarily fix age old problems  Outline key objectives, challenges and requirements to stakeholders  Provide metrics ­ if it cannot be measured, it cannot be managed  Question yourself and how things are currently being done (understand, not challenge)  Response capabilities may well save your company and your career ­ response never goes out of style  So what? Ask yourself what will happen if we do, and what will happen if we don't  Technology is one component, people and processes will always be the front and center for security  Validate ideas and approaches internally prior to executing

 What is the worst thing you could say to your stakeholders at 3AM? This will help understand what matters most to them and what you will need to focus on
 XaaS ­ can you deliver the same value to the business using different models or approaches?  Yesterday's threats and attacks are still the big headache  Zero in on the things that matter most to your business stakeholders
Reality Check: Our mission and objective should be to enable more secure and resilient services, while protecting our organization's brand, it's customers and employees. We will never stop all attacks, but our success should be determined by our ability to respond and `stop the bleeding', while continuing to deliver services to customers and users.

Sanity Check

#RSAC
In Summary & Final Thoughts!

Car Accidents vs. Security Breaches

 Rules of road to protect drivers and pedestrians

 Regulations and standards to protect businesses and consumers

 Speed limits depending on the type of road

 Regulations depending on the type of industry and sector

 Wide choice of cars available depending on your needs

 Wide choice of solutions and providers depending on your requirements

 By not adhering to rules and laws of the road, you put your own and others' lives at risk

 By not adhering to security rules, standards, frameworks and best practice, thousands of incidents are happening every days putting your organization and its customers at risk

 Despite all road safety guidelines, laws and awareness there are countless road accidents and fatalities every day

 Despite all the standards, guidance, frameworks, regulations and more solutions and services than ever before; countless incidents, breaches and non-compliance continue
