Everything Is Different Nothing Has Changed

#RSAC
Sun Who?
"The greatest victory is that which requires no battle."

#RSAC
Everything is different...
 The Perfect Storm: People, Process and Technology Changes  Cloud has disintermediated IT from infrastructure being delivered  Shadow IT has distributed Data & introduced unknown risks  IT has become a broker responsible for vendor management  Cloud's main enabling technologies are it's biggest vulnerabilities  The "SDDC" complicates transparency & introduces new risk  Exposure to "unknown unknowns" without automation

#RSAC
Nothing has changed
 Information has always been king, it just wasn't as plentiful  Bad actors sought to steal data before the dawn of Mainframes  Humans ­ mainly insiders ­ remain the weakest link in the chain  Low cost distribution nearly always wins out  Change is constant and continues to accelerate  Convergence continues to blur lines of responsibility

"Know thy self, know thy

#RSAC

enemy. A thousand battles,

a thousand victories."

#RSAC
Know thy self means know your providers
 Historically it was easy to know your computing estate  Then servers became portable as Virtual Machines
 VM Portability did to IT what the tank did to fortresses
 New insider threats enabled by the Hypervisor
 Who are the CSP's Insiders? Who is watching them?
 How do I gain insight into the providers' risk & vulnerabilities?  Transparency: How is the cloud audited and monitored?  How do I to quantify and prioritize these risks? Ensure Compliance?

#RSAC
Know thy enemy ­ and discover risk
 Increased Surface Area and opportunity for attack without detection  Thousands of Risks emerge each day across the IT Portfolio
­ How do I ensure my CSP is not at risk? And/or placing me at risk?
 Supply Chain Risks
­ Risk from compromised BIOS; Wholescale theft of systems ­ Chain of Custody & Data locality: where can systems and data run? ­ How secure is the Cloud Service Provider Portal?
 Transparency: How are emerging threats disclosed and reported?  Which risks apply to my applications and how do I prioritize?

"The wise general will use

the highest intelligence of

#RSAC

the army for the purposes

of spying, and thereby they

achieve great results."

#RSAC
Become the enemy to defeat the enemy
"You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended."
 This is exactly what the attackers did in the Target POS breach
 Turn the Tables on the enemy with Cyber Situational Awareness
­ Use Continuous Monitoring to identify the undefended & OOC ­ Use Predictive Analytics & Big Data to find the vulnerabilities ­ Use Risk Scoring to prioritize the risks that must be addressed first ­ Then, fix them before they can be exploited by the enemy

"If ignorant both of your

#RSAC

enemy and yourself, you

are certain to be in peril."

#RSAC
Apply: Know yourself, know your Cloud(s)
Next week, you should:
 Begin developing a plan for hardware attestation in Private Environments  Query providers for committed attestation implementation dates
In the next three months, you should:
 Secure Provider commitments for transparent automated data feeds  Begin deployment of comprehensive Continuous Monitoring toolset
Within six months, you should:
 Completely address all elements of transparency for risk monitoring  Deploy Continuous Monitoring across all assets: cloud and on-premise

#RSAC
Apply: Know enemy, know your risk
Next week, you should:
 Identify critical cloud service(s) within your portfolio: Private & Public  Establish a RACI for security and risk with your providers
In the next three months, you should:
 Investigate automated risk toolsets leveraging Continuous Monitoring  Develop an understanding of where your blind spots are vis-à-vis risk
Within six months, you should:
 Be well into the deployment of your Automated Risk Management Toolset  Begin to address newly identified risks
