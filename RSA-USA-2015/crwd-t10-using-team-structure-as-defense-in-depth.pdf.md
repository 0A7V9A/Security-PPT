So Where Did All This Start?
 The traditional development methodology is a sequential design process commonly referred to as "Waterfall"
 Originally created in the manufacturing and construction industries where changes in scope are not typically possible due to costs
 First documented in software development in 1970  For some software companies it's still in use today...

 Security is no longer at the end of the Waterfall
 Application Security is part of the Development and tested in QA  Web App Testing, OWASP, PenTesting, Static Code analysis
 Security Operations is part of Ops  Logging, Monitoring, IDS,
 Infrastructure Security is part of Architecture  Firewalls, Proxies, IPS, Anti-virus, APT Detection
