Is this a useful metric?

Shows the trend

Should we be worried about this peak?

Are these numbers high or low? Is this normal?

#RSAC
Simple to understand
If it is blocked everything must
be ok?

What decision do you want from me?

At AP we have taken a different approach.

We use a maturity metric model.

Maturity rating is a measure of effectiveness of implemented controls across

People, Process & Technology

Or something you'll use?

 When you get back to the office:  Throw away your old metrics that aren't leading to decisions  Get your business scorecard  Work out how security contributes to that scorecard  Create your own contribution in business language  Repeat...and get better...

 Over time challenge your teams:  Can we report on maturity against business need and strategy?  What "decisions" have we accepted?  What "decisions" does our organisation need to make?
