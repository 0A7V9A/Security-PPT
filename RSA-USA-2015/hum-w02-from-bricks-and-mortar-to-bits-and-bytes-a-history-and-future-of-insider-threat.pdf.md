Defining Insider Threat
Insider Threat: A person who has the potential to harm an organization for which they have inside knowledge or access. An insider threat can have a negative impact on any aspect of an organization, including employee and/or public safety, reputation, operations, finances, and mission continuity.

#RSAC
The Bricks and Mortar Workplace
Era Characteristics
 Attributes: Physical actions are observable, which leads to external constraints
 Behavior: Person-to-person handoffs of hard copy information  Insider Programs: Counterintelligence focused and reactive

John Walker (Navy)1
 Access: Navy Chief Warrant Officer and communications specialist
 Rationale: Validation; $500 - $1,000 a week
 Exploit: Helped the Soviet Union decipher more than one million encrypted messages

Steven Louis Davis (Gillette)2
 Access: Lead Process Control Engineer with access to the development of a new system
 Rationale: Anger at supervisor; removed from position as lead developer
 Exploit: Sent confidential engineering drawings to several competitors

#RSAC
The Transitional Workplace
Era Characteristics
 Attributes: Unobservable virtual actions avoid external constraints ­ leaving only internal constraints
 Behavior: Download data using removable media
 Insider Programs: Use physical, behavioral, and some technology indicators

Brian Regan (NRO)3
 Access: Signals intelligence specialist with access to Intelink
 Rationale: Validation; debt
 Exploit: Stole 15,000 pages, CD-ROMs, videos

Greg Chung (Boeing)4
 Access: Stress analyst with a high security clearance and access to technical blueprints and designs
 Rationale: Allegiance; "contribute to the motherland"
 Exploit: Stole `hundreds of thousands of documents' to bring to China under the guise of giving lectures

7

#RSAC
The Bits and Bytes Workplace
Era Characteristics
 Attributes: Tracking of virtual actions create external constraints  Behavior: Machine to machine file transfer to exfiltrate data  Insider Programs: Correlate virtual and non-virtual behavior

Yuan Li (Sanofi Aventis)5
 Access: Research chemist with access to secret R&D work and lab test results
 Rationale: Greed/ allegiance; sold secrets to a Chinese chemical company she had stake in
 Exploit: Downloaded information to her home computer from internal databases to sell

Edward Snowden (NSA)6
 Access: Network administrator with a high level of access to classified information
 Rationale: Validation; disagreement with US surveillance and privacy policies

An Uncertain Future
Changes in technology and privacy protections could alter the insider dynamic
10

#RSAC
Nearsighted/farsighted
Scenario Characteristics
 Attributes: Lots of data solutions, all of which are imperfect, in a privacy protected world
 Threat: Malicious insiders become more common and destructive while external actors actively recruit complacent insiders
 Strategies: Must find new ways to baseline risky behaviors and define new processes to carefully adhere to compliance guidelines
11

Selective Views

#RSAC
Scenario Characteristics
 Attributes: Technology gets much more powerful, but is constrained by privacy protections
 Threat: Limited data collection creates opportunities for complacent and malicious insiders
 Strategies: Organizations leverage advanced technical tools to best utilize the data permitted for collection, invest in training and enhanced technical controls
12

#RSAC
Unreconciled Perspectives
Scenario Characteristics
 Attributes: Data solutions remain highly imperfect and dispersed while privacy protections diminish
 Threat: Malicious insiders become a more significant threat than complacent insiders who can be monitored, though ineffectually
 Strategies: Organizations increase investment in manpower to monitor disparate tools and training to curb complacent insiders
13

20/20 Vision

#RSAC
Scenario Characteristics
 Attributes: Real-time insider threat mitigation capabilities become available and operate at scale
 Threat: Quick identification of malicious insiders shifts the focus to external actors who recruit complacent insiders
 Strategies: Significant insider technology investments accompanied by process changes to improve ROI

Applying this Knowledge to Protect your

#RSAC

Organization

 Identify your critical assets  Determine your "risk appetite" and "risk tolerance"  Catalog potential risk indicators in your organizational data  Understand organization's culture and how it can be targeted  Continually evaluate program effectiveness to meet evolving
threats
