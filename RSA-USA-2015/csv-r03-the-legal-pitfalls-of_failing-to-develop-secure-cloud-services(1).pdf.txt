Overview and How to Apply Today's

#RSAC

Discussion

 Framing: Which laws are most relevant when considering developing for the cloud and balancing cloud security risks?

 Overview: Relevant legal paradigms

 Scenarios: Cloud security issues and concerns

 Discussion: You should come away with a baseline of key legal questions around developing and operating secure cloud services

#RSAC
Thinking about developing for a cloud service?

Statutory Obligations
(Federal and State)

Civil Obligations
Tort Law
Reasonableness
(Negligence)

Regulatory Obligations
Direct or customer's

Contractual Obligations
Corporate Governance

Standards

Best Practices

Mental checklist your lawyer's thinking about

The Kind of Technology Lawyers Worry About
5

#RSAC
Conflicting Legal Paradigms

Strict Liability

Negligence

Contracts

Often based in statute, such as data breach notification laws
No fault insurance approach
Socially-useful but potentially dangerous could trigger liability (i.e., collections of data)
Internalization of costs

Based in civil law, as a standard of care
Industry standards \ best practices
Companies have an incentive to act reasonably to improve compliance and mitigate liability
Evolving questions around standard of care for coders, operators, and users ­ in particular for critical infrastructures

Based on the four corners of the contract
Civil law very deferential to the terms
May limit remedies, damages, and set out very specific obligations that matter greatly in crises
App Store terms can count!

Adding Legal Complexity:

#RSAC

The Laws of Other Countries and the Cloud

Global Issues
Increasing legislative and standards and compliance requirements worldwide
 Brazil, China, Germany, EU, Russia European Union proceedings in play

Cloud Specific Issues
Differing legal regimes complicate "cloud governance", in particular around data
Cross-border data transfers, remote processing, and storage increase the risk of disclosure to governments, litigants, other third parties

 Data Protection Directive covers all processing of "personal data"; high penalties (2-5% of global revenue)

Perception of magnified risks of data loss due to hacking, security breaches, or inadvertent disclosure, destruction of data

 Network and Information Security Directive Location still matters legally.

#RSAC
Security Scenarios
Compromise of a 3rd party cloud app that impacts your corporate network, potential impact to customer data
Compromise of the cloud service provider's service, potential impact to customer data
Development of Apps for the Cloud
8

#RSAC
Your business is using a 3rd party cloud app supporting your main product, and it holds customer data. It appears to have leaked customer data.
 What does the contract say? Any remedies or protections or requirements?  Investigation, response (including comms), notice to customers, duty to collaborate  Are you indemnified for this incident by the 3rd party?
 Do you have the ability to investigate directly versus dependency on app provider to investigate?  Asserting Attorney Client Privilege in the investigation  Do you need to pull in outside assistance (technical, legal) to aid in the investigation?  If there are other app customers impacted, is there information that can be shared that would aid your response?

#RSAC

Your business is using a 3rd party cloud app supporting your main product, and it holds

customer data. It appears to have leaked customer data.

(continued)

 Is the 3rd party app provider managing PR adequately? Are the 3rd party's statements adding to your legal risks?
 Is this event material? Does it trigger SEC reporting? Have you notified your Board?
 Do you need or want to contact law enforcement?

10

#RSAC
Compromise of the cloud service provider, potential impact to customer data.
 What does the contract say? Any remedies or protections or requirements?
 Investigation, response (including comms), notice to customers, duty to collaborate  What audit rights do you have?  Are you comfortable with the adequacy of the CSP's compliance capabilities?
11

#RSAC
Compromise of the cloud service provider, potential impact to customer data.
(continued)
 Do you have the ability to investigate directly versus dependency on service provider to investigate?
 Asserting Attorney Client Privilege in the investigation  Do you need to pull in outside assistance (technical, legal) to aid in the investigation?  Is the cloud service provider managing PR adequately?  Is this event material? Does it trigger SEC reporting? Have you notified your Board?  Do you need or want to contact law enforcement?
 CSP is preparing for class action, government inquiries, major media issues ­ what do you need as the customer to manage your legal risks?
12

#RSAC
Developing Apps for the Cloud.
 Standards and Best Practices matter a lot:  Are there standards or best practices must follow for development on a particular platform or for a particular service?  Are you using relevant laws or standards to help manage your customers' risks, to make your app more attractive for them?  Are there other relevant global standards or certifications that help mitigate downstream risks? (i.e., ISO 27034)
13

Developing Apps for the Cloud.

#RSAC
(continued)

 What do the terms of the App store or sales platform for your app? Do they talk to security or your obligations in development or in an incident?
 Things to consider when you are developing:  Do you have an incident response plan? Does it include legal and PR?  What forensic capabilities do you have?  How secure is your infrastructure?  What promises can or should you make in your EULA?

14

Applying What You've Learned

#RSAC

 Next week you should:
 Know your lawyer and begin a conversation about the legal aspects of managing cyber risks
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Develop a regime to mitigate the risks around developing or using cloud services
 Within six months you should:
 Be actively mitigating risks that arise when developing a cloud service

Moving Beyond Forms
Develop Software and
operations using best practices

Assess new data collection,
uses and integrations proactively

Treat data use and operations like lifecycles

Continually educate and
train stakeholders

Risk Management
by Design

Ensure compliance program based in law and best
practices

Develop incident response plans, data security protocols and risk mitigation strategies

Document assessments for privacy, security, etc.

Growing In Relevance: The NIST Framework #RSAC
www.nist.gov/cyberframework (February 12, 2014)
Step 1: Prioritize and Scope. Step 2: Orient. Step 3: Create a Current Profile. Step 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment. Step 5: Create a Target Profile. Step 6: Determine, Analyze, and
Prioritize Gaps.
Step 7: Implement Action Plan.

#RSAC
Good Questions to Ask:
 Are we "critical infrastructure" operators? Are my clients or prospective clients "critical infrastructure" operators?
 Will my clients be subject to privacy and security regulation and expect\need their cloud service to comply?
 Do we know what sort of data is being processed and the legal requirements that apply to it?  What cloud compliance or certifications are available, and would help customers manage their
own risks?  What have we learned through past incidents have we experienced? Are we learning internally?  Do we have an up-to-date method for ensuring security in development and operations?  What commitments have we made in the applicable contract or privacy policy?  Who is monitoring best industry practices?
