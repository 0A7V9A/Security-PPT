#RSAC
Common Misconceptions & Misunderstandings
I am "compliant" therefore I am secure My data is out of scope because <insert "silver bullet" here> I know where all my CHD is ­ it's in my CDE My vendors do my compliance for me

#RSAC
Easier Said Than Done
Why we fail to maintain secure environments
· Lack of awareness by IT practitioners · Incentive to keep security a primary focus · Quickly evolving technology landscape · Rapid development and distribution of
new solutions · Still unnecessary exposure of CHD

Eliminate the Simple

92% of compromises were simple

96% were avoidable through simple or intermediate controls

Results from a Concentrated Focus on PCI
Concentrated focus on PCI can prevent one mistake leading to mass data compromise

#RSAC
Reduce the Attack Surface

Continually Identify the environment

Maintain a CHD Dataflow Diagram

Meet regularly with those able to create cardholder data pathways

DLP Methodology

Partner with Trusted Experts

Verify claims of PCI DSS compliance

Require agreements to maintain skillset

#RSAC

#RSAC
Defining and Following Best Practices
Are you asking the right questions?

How does the cardholder data flow?

Where is there storage of data?

Where is there available connectivity?

Is all cardholder data classified as such?

What are our dependencies?

What features are installed by default?

Have Clear Asset Identification of Payment Account Data

You Can't Attack What Isn't There
Confirm there is still need to retain

Verify with your financial partners

Evaluate opportunities to use surrogate values to replace PAN

How Do We Measure Success?

#RSAC
ROSI: It's a Measurement Problem

Risk is hard to quantify

Data may not be easily available

Growing complexity of technology make metrics also complex

Goal for Security Metrics

To move from a culture of fear and
uncertainty
Security Metrics: Removing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt by Andrew Jacquith

to a culture of awareness and

#RSAC
then a culture of measurement
28

Goal for PCI Security Metrics

To move from uncertainty of where
cardholder data is
Security Metrics: Removing Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt by Andrew Jacquith

to a culture of awareness and

#RSAC
then a culture of measuring
improvement
29

Bad Metrics
Unclear
 Inconsistently measured

Costly
 Does the metric improve cost of investment?

#RSAC
Unusable
 Incomplete numbers

#RSAC
Measure Success and Identify Opportunities
Create Good Metrics

Consistently measured

Reasonable to gather

Quantitative

NIST SP 800-55 ­ Must be relevant

#RSAC
What Consistent Metrics can Provide
Frequency is just as important as metric
Constant measuring reduces deviation in security practices

#RSAC
PCI Security Metrics Should Help Reduce Attack Surface to Cardholder Data
One of the main goals of building secure systems and applications is to minimize the Attack surface...
The smaller the attack surface, the more difficult it is for the attacker to leverage a vulnerability into a successful attack
Consider ways to quantify that

Measure Success and Identify Opportunities

Examples of PCI metrics

Req 1
 Number of systems with direct connectivity to CDE
 % of connections to/from unauthorized hosts
 Mean time to complete configuration changes
 Average frequency of firewall review

Req 2

Req 3

#RSAC

#RSAC
Measure Success and Identify Opportunities

Examples of PCI metrics

Req 1
 Number of systems with direct connectivity
 Ratio of attacks per e-commerce sessions

Req 2
 Number of default passwords 6 months after ROC
 % of systems configured to system hardening standards

Req 3

#RSAC
Metrics are a Tradeoff
The maximal favorable result at minimal cost

#RSAC
Reasonable Collection Methods
Manual collection is not only costly but higher likelihood of error and difficult to sustain
Automated tools can provide consistency to collection methods

#RSAC
Tools to Help Collect

Where to Find Measurement Data?

Tools:
 Source code analyzers  Dynamic application
scanners  Attack Surface Analyzer  ASV scan report  Threat Modeling Tool  File Fuzzing Tools  Regex Fuzzer  Visual Studio Code Analysis

Locations:
 System inventory  Security vulnerability scans  Logs  Report of Compliance  Other audit reporting  IT bug tickets  Incident Response

#RSAC
Most Importantly: Relevant
Contextually specific
Are meaningful to the user and relevant to the decision-making process

#RSAC
Cost Effectiveness
COST new strategy ­ COST current practice
CE = BENEFIT new strategy ­ BENEFIT current
practice
CE < 1.0  favorable

#RSAC
What is your TCO for PAN Retention?
What is the cost to retain PAN? What is the value of retention? What is the liability for retention?

#RSAC
A Single ROC is Simply a Measurement

Measurement is just one point in time

Metrics compare at least two or more

Value in analytics to compare year-over-year?

Can support trends in progress for securing CHD

Balanced PCI Scorecard
What are the security versions of the four corners of a balanced scorecard:

Financial v Security
Learning and growth v Security

Internal business processes v Security
Customer v Security
