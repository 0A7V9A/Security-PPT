Largest Breach Ever...

#RSAC

#RSAC
A Short Reality Break
 Retail fraud averages about 1.5% of sales  Target 2014 Revenue = $73B, so about $1.1B of fraud  The online breach was big but only 15% of Target's acceptable cost of fraud
 Another way to look at it:
If Target had avoided the breach but increased shopping cart abandonment rate by 1% it would have decreased its return to shareholders.

#RSAC
There Are a Lot of Overcome Obstacles Out There
 Increase Effectiveness and Efficiency
 Avoid more vulnerabilities  Block more attacks  Detect incidents more quickly  Free up budget to deal with emerging threats

Problem: Malware leading to breaches but

more frequently to expensive PC re-imaging

 Solutions that work:
 Lockdown  Network-based Advanced Threat Detection  Privilege Management/Whitelisting  Endpoint Intrusion Prevention/Containment

#RSAC
Advanced Threat Detection
 Problem: Typical university environment meant distributed management of desktops, lots of BYOD, high rate of malware being found on PCs.
 Solution: Network-based Advanced Threat Detection appliances (Fireeye) at Internet ingress point.
 Results:
 Intrusion Detection Rate increased 46%  Incident rate (requiring corrective action) decreased 35%
12

#RSAC
Better Endpoint Security
 Problem: Financial services firm found traditional anti-viral was not able to address advanced targeted threats.
 Solution: Host based security (Invincea) on Windows PCs.  Results:
 Baseline average was reimaging 4 PCs per week  After deployment, reimaging 1 PC every 3 months  Look at cheaper/free AV in the future?

#RSAC
Problem: Reducing Vulnerabilities
 Solutions that work:
 Spend less on the easy parts  Innovative application testing approaches  Mature and Secure Software Development
Lifecycle
14

#RSAC
Reduce Cost of Vulnerability Scanning
 Problem: Healthcare Services firm was at renewal point for vulnerability scanning solution.
 Solution: Switched to Tenable Nessus/System Center  Results:
 Reduced spending by 75%  Able to use savings to increase frequency and coverage of scanning
15

More Effective Identification #RSAC of Application Vulnerabilities
 Problem: Reduce vulnerabilities in revenue-bearing applications.  Solution: Switched from consulting engagement to "managed
crowdsourced bug bounty" approach (Bugcrowd)  Results:
 Same spending resulted in 10x increase in vulnerabilities discovered  Testers increased from 2-3 to 63  Higher quality/more developer-friendly vuln info provided
16

#RSAC
Reduce Cost and Risk of Corporate Applications
 Problem: Healthcare company needs to reduce threat exposure and bug fix costs across all corporate applications.
 Solution: Participated in Building Security In Maturity Model (Cigital) to reduce vulnerabilities in corporate apps
 Results:
 Defect density decreased by 92% for high/moderate vulnerabilities  Apps using secure library increased each month  Threat modeling approach reduced resource time from 40 hours to 2  Overall CDLC productivity increase of 15% estimated
17

#RSAC
Action Steps
 Is a major transition coming?
 Windows migration, move to SaaS, etc  Re-org, merger/acquisition
 Did one of your peers get breached?  Security product refresh coming up?  Is it time for an audit or penetration
test?
