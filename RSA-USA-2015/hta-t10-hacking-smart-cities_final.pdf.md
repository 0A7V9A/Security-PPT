Are Cyber Threats real?

Intro
 Why is important this presentation and you aren't wasting time  Ask questions, how, what, why, how they feel or would feel, etc.
what would happen if? Would you like that? Etc do you live in a city? What would happen in your city? Ver de hacer algunas durante la presentacion, cercal del final, etc.  Make people think  Pictures of black out, traffic jams, etc

What is a Smart City?
 Many different definitions, but here's a simple one:
A city that uses technology to automate and improve city services, making citizens life better
 More than a $1 trillion potential market by 2020
6

#RSAC
How is a City "Smart"?
 Traffic control  Parking  Street lighting  Public transportation  Energy, Water and Waste management
7

#RSAC
How is a City "Smart"? (cont.)
 Security  City management systems  M2M  Sensors (weather, pollution, seismic, smell, flood, sound, etc. )  Open data (could be real time)  Mobile apps
8

#RSAC
Problems
 New technologies (system, devices, etc.) are being deployed without any security testing
 Ease-of-use and quick deployment vs security  Plagued by vulnerabilities (vendors are clueless about security)
 Almost everything is wireless
 Custom protocol and encryption-related issues (even in RF transceiver chips)
 Lack of city CERTs means weak coordination and communication on security incidents
9

#RSAC
Problems (cont.)
 Huge and unknown attack surface
 Complexity, interdependency, chain reaction
 Patch deployment and systems updates
 How to test on non-production system?  How to keep up patching up to date?  If patch isn't available for a vulnerability, stop the service?  Patch delays by vendors and patches difficult to apply
 Legacy systems (vulnerable) communicate with new systems
 Lack of standards

Problems (cont.)
11

#RSAC
Problems (cont.)
 Simple bugs can cause big problems and have big impact
 May 2012 California: Placer County Courthouse system accidentally summoned 1,200 people to jury duty on the same morning causing traffic jam
 November 2013 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART): major software glitch, service was shut down by a technical problem involving track switching, it affected 19 trains with about 500 to 1,000 passengers on board
 August 2003 Northeast: blackout, primary cause was a software bug in the alarm system at a control room of the FirstEnergy Corporation, 55 million people affected
12

#RSAC
Problems (cont.)
 Government bureaucracy and shortage of skilled people  No response plan to react to possible cyber attacks on city
services, systems, infrastructure, etc.  Many possible ways to abuse and attack services
 Smart City DoS
 Devices and systems difficult to get for research community
13

#RSAC
Attacks
 Last year proven attacks on traffic control systems
 University of Michigan ­ Econolite ­ 100,000 intersections in US and Canada
 Myself ­ Sensys Networks ­ 200,000 sensors worldwide  Demo...
 Street lighting
 Wireless encryption problems  Could black out big city area, island, etc.

Attacks (cont.)
15

#RSAC
Attacks (cont.)
 City management systems
 Manipulate information  Send workers to dig a hole to wrong place (gas, water pipes)
On June 7, 2010, a 36-inch gas pipeline explosion and fire in Johnson County, Texas, was caused by workers installing poles for electrical lines. One worker was killed, and six were injured. Confusion over the location and status of the construction work led to the pipeline not being marked beforehand
16

#RSAC
Attacks (cont.)
 Sensors  Fake seismic detection, fake flood detection, fake *, etc.
 Public data (sometimes real time) available to attackers  Easily find vendors and implemented solutions  Schedule attacks, attack triggers, coordination, etc.
 Mobile apps  Attack apps, apps developers, data feeds
 Smart City servers and cloud infrastructure  Beware of Smarty City SaaS  DDoS attacks can take services off line (Smart City DoS)
17

#RSAC
Attacks (cont.)
 Smart grid related attacks  Attacks on end points (smart meters, devices, etc.)
 Public transportation information systems  Influencing behavior by displaying wrong information, overcrowding, etc.
 Attack impact can increase if people get panic  Promote attacks on social media
 Traffic cameras and surveillance  Hundreds of same brand, no remote restart, vulnerabilities, etc.  DoS attacks make Smart Cities blind

Threats and skilled attackers
 New war scenarios (cyberwar) make cities technologies an important and interesting target
 Nation states have the knowledge and skills to easily attack cities and cause significant damage
 Cyber terrorism could be just around the corner. People with university degrees are joining extremist groups
 Cybercriminals are well organized and have plenty of resources. Their attack techniques and malware continuously evolve
 Hacktivists groups are known for launching cyber attacks campaigns on companies, organizations, groups of people, governments, and so on
21

#RSAC
Solutions and applications
 Do not implement systems and devices without security testing  Simple checklist for encryption, authentication, authorization, and software updates will make big difference
 Ask vendors to provide all security documentation and timely response  SLA include patching vulnerabilities on time and 24/7 response in case of incidents
 Fix security issues as soon as they are discovered. A city can continuously be under attack if issues are not fixed as soon as possible
 Create City CERT that can handle incidents, vulnerability reporting and patching, coordination, information sharing, etc.
22

#RSAC
Solutions and applications
 Regularly run pen tests in all city systems and networks  Implement fail safe and manual overrides on all city systems  Implement and make known secondary services/procedures in
case of cyber attacks
 Define a formal communication channel
 Restrict access to public data
 Request registration, track and monitor access/usage
 Prepare for the worst, threat model everything
23

#RSAC
Conclusions
 Smart Cities current attack surface is huge and wide open to attacks  It's only a matter of time until attacks on city services and infrastructure
become common  Smart Cities related technologies should be properly audited to make
certain that they are secure before use  Actions must be taken now to make cities more secure and protect
against cyber attacks  Smart Cities become Dumb Cities when the data that feeds them is
blindly trusted and easily manipulated
