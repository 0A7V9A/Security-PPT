Nothing New Under the Sun

#RSAC

We - the undersigned - strongly oppose any attempt to use the power of hacking to threaten or destroy the information infrastructure of a country, for any reason. This has nothing to do with hacktivism or hacker ethics and is nothing a hacker could be proud of.
What happens when someone in another country decides that the United States needs to be punished for its human rights record? This is one door that will be very hard to close if we allow it to be opened.
Governments worldwide are seeking to establish cyberspace as a new battleground for their artificial conflicts. If hackers solicit recognition as paramilitary factions then hacking in general will be seen as an act of war.
Strategic combat planning in the United States and among other nations has reached the point where real-world cases are needed to justify assigned budgets. The LoU is providing this real-world case now.

#RSAC

"We believe that the LoU should carefully investigate the idea of declaring "war" against China and Iraq. Was it planted with them by someone with different interests in mind other than advancing human rights considerations?"

Attribution
 Levels of attribution:  Specific technical identifiers ­ allows blocking from identical source  General category of actors ­ allows you to understand likely targets and objectives, direct public relations, policy  Team or actor persona ­ allows detection of other methods in use by actor  True name attribution ­ allows direct law enforcement engagement
As a security professional or intelligence analyst, attribution to a category of individuals is critical for affecting business.

Core Collection & Analysis Capabilities

#RSAC
Apply
 If you are in the news media sector, be skeptical.
 Do not simply react to public hacktivist pronouncements. Be informed as to the true capabilities of the different groups that are likely to impact your organization.
 Understand "trigger actions" for your organization. Educate business executives to be aware of possible triggering risks and establish a communications process that facilitates risk discussions (integrate IT security and public relations).
 Understand business risks and mitigation strategies for extended outages of critical systems. There is a difference between systems being degraded and being destroyed.
