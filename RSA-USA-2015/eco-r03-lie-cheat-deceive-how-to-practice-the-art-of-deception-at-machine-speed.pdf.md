#RSAC

Why continue to do things the way we always #RSAC have?
 Imagine:
 Within every aspect of our lives there are rules, legal and moral guidelines that must be followed
 These tell us what actions are permissible, what responses are appropriate, in short every element of our behaviour
 Sport clearly illustrate this  Football, sorry Soccer ­ 11 people per team, rules govern the time they play, how they play, where they play, each role has it's own set of behavioural rules
 Do you really have to follow a set of rules for Cybersecurity?

So How Do Attackers See Us?
 We are bloated, slow, overworked, underpaid, stressed
 We are guided by the wrong people  Users: "it's too complicated and it doesn't have a fruit logo on it"  Auditor: "Get someone else to do it, and have you documented it?"  Procurement: "Choose the lowest bidder"  Board: "I don't understand, why are we doing it?"
 Attackers see us as static, easy to locate, easy to invade, always up, and there's plenty of people on the inside to rely on for help

#RSAC
In short, we look like this...

#RSAC
Home Field Advantage?
 Over 5000 years of warfare "the defender" has always had the presumed advantage in any fight
 Required a ratio of 4:1 for the attacker to be "assured" of victory over the defender  The defender picks the battlefield  The defender can typically move faster  The defender begins with forces that are optimally deployed to take advantage of the terrain
 In cyber, this advantage should be even more pronounced  The defender can control what the attacker sees  The defender can dictate what they have access to  The defender can stop the attack simply by disconnecting
 Why did we give up the natural advantages we have in defending our networks and applications?

#RSAC
The Wrong Mind-set?
 We start with a mindset of losing:
 The attacker only needs 1 vulnerability while the defender has to defend everything
 The attacker has infinite time and infinite resources
 We forget that the attacker has to do "abnormal" things
 Create unusual traffic  Create failures
 Why don't we catch them in time?

Practice the Art of Deception to Better Defend
 Be less predictable, Be faster, Be more aggressive
 Lie  Cheat  Deceive
Change the Game.

Lie ­ Attackers don't tell the whole truth!
 Attackers falsify browser headers, spoof IP addresses, use other peoples machines in order to present a false front

Cheat ­ There's A Whole Army Against You

 Botnet armies give them superior power
 Zeus EuroGrabber ­ Stole $47million from 30,000 customers through mobile devices
 ZeroAccess Botnet Network globally an estimated 1,000,000 devices
 Mining bitcoin and other banking credentials, its estimated it generates $100,000 per day for its operators
