Human Dynamics

Quantity of Vulnerabilities  Scarce - Numerous Ease of Vulnerability Discovery  Easy - Difficult to Find Likelihood of Vulnerability Rediscovery  Low - High Technical Difficulty of Remediation  Easy - Hard to Fix Logistical Difficulty of Remediation  Easy - Hard to Access Average Life of a Vulnerability  Short - Long Third Party Market for Vulnerability  Offensive, Defensive, Mixed, Etc.
Market Size  Small - Large Bug Bounty Program  Yes, No
Attackers  Criminals, States, Patriots, Etc. Researcher Pool  Small - Large Attacker Motivation  Political, Financial, Reputational

#RSAC
"Bug Collisions" Between Offense & Defense
 Discovery from offensive stockpile is very sensitive to the correlation. A powerful lever!
 Defensive capacity development or offensive capacity minimization have different levels of importance depending on the value of the correlation.

#RSAC
How does discovery correlation arise and behave?
Fixed code base
Heterogeneous vulnerabilities Common techniques between research groups
24

#RSAC
For a young piece of software
With our model parameters, 9% overlap
25

#RSAC
For a hardened piece of software
With our model parameters, 0.8% overlap

#RSAC
Rate of "Bug Collisions" Varies with Target
 Correlation can arise naturally due to varied discovery difficulty
 As software becomes more hardened, expect to see less correlation between discovery groups

#RSAC
Defenders Scale Best With Tools & Techniques

#RSAC
Money Changes Everything
 Be careful not to create perverse incentives  Unintended consequences of draining resources if defense
bounties are too high

#RSAC
Key Takeaways For Organizations
 Creating incentives for tools and techniques for vulnerability discovery is a more efficient way for defenders to drain the offensive stockpile
 Bug bounties are still effective to help find vulnerabilities, especially in less mature software
 The vulnerability market is not controlled by price alone.

#RSAC
Key Takeaways for Governments
 Many governments are in the role of both attacker and defender
 Governments need to broaden the focus of policy debates, it is not just about whether or not to stockpile individual vulnerabilities for offense
 Governments reap defense gains when they make vulnerability discovery tools and techniques available to defenders.

#RSAC
Applying this Research in the Real World
 Use Incentive programs!
 Bounty tools and techniques (e.g., fuzzers & tools that help determine exploitability). The most effective way to drain the offensive stock pile.
 Bug bounties are an effective way to help find vulnerabilities, especially in young software.
What Are We Doing?
 The Internet Bug Bounty is offering bounties for tools and techniques this year.
 We are looking to involve more organizations in our research with MIT

#RSAC
It Has Not Escaped Our Notice...
 The Wolves of Vuln Street are among us
 We are studying the dynamics of the pack to make the shepherds of the Internet Defense more effective
 More models are needed to identify and mobilize other levers besides price in the 0day market
