"Startups don't like friction to get their job done. Security feels like friction."
- Ajay Varia, VP Eng, Piazza

Brian Birch, Symantec

"Startups are incredibly vulnerable to cyber attacks in their first 18 months. If a business thinks that it's too small to matter to cybercriminals, then it's fooling itself with a false sense of security."

20% of small businesses in Canada reported falling victim to cyber crimes in the prior 12 months.

"When our API collapsed under a DDoS attack, we experienced more customer churn in that one day than we had in the entire two years since our launch."

The Ten Steps
1. Business Cyber Risk Analysis 2. Embrace Security in Your Culture 3. Select the Right Platforms 4. Email is the Master Key 5. Your Web Site is the Front Door 6. Secure Coding 7. Control the Internal Network 8. Physical Security 9. Plan for Failure 10. Be Open with the Public

1. Business Cyber Risk Analysis
With so many ways to hack our systems, why do we even bother?
A. Just do the "standard stuff" B. It's silly to go halfway ­ close every vulnerability. C. Resistance is futile ­ don't bother. D. Choose the battles based on risk and cost.

Some Common Threats
Stolen or leaked IP Stolen funds Stolen computer resources Stolen business information Account data breach Employee information Email dump

THREAT
Large DDoS Attack
(50+ Gbps for 2+ hours)

LIKELIHOOD
1.2 incidents / year
(based on industry averages)

LOSS / INCIDENT
Lost gross margin $2k Remediation $100k 10% churn $2,000k
(based on 10% drop in market value)

EXPECTED LOSS $2.522M / year

#RSAC
Defense Plan
1. Large DDoS Attack

Detection:

Configure load balancer alerts, server load alerts, and auto-search Twitter for keywords "outage" "crashed" and "site down", $120/year

Prevention:

DDoS protection service, $60k/year

Remediation: Pre-breach Prepare outage page and key customer contact list.

Post-breach Cutover to protection service
Redirect to temporary outage screen Blog post, and reach out directly to major customers

New Likelihood:

1.2 / year

New Loss / Incident: $500 lost gross margin, no churn

Net Expected Loss: $61k / year (97% mitigation)

2. Embrace Security in Your Culture
Thousands of decisions are made every day. Culture is how you, as say a leader of the company, are confident that every one of those decisions is the right one.
­ Jeff Lawson, Founder of Twilio

#RSAC
2. Embrace Security in Your Culture
 Share the BCRA with all employees.
 Schedule periodic training sessions.
 Create an easy reporting mechanism (e.g. security@yourstartup.com) for any employee to report suspicious activities.
 Adopt single-sign-on and password management tools
 Schedule penetration testing on a regular basis ­ ideally once a quarter (about a $20k expense) ­ and each "pen test" should simulate targeted phishing attacks on your employees. (K2)

3. Select the Right Platforms

#RSAC
4. Your Email is the Master Key

4. Your Email is the Master Key

5. Your Web Site is the Front Door

Web site

Mobile App

Shoppers, prospective employees, journalists, reviewers, partners, bloggers, investors

#RSAC
Robbing Your Customers
Deploy a web application firewall. Secure your API with expiring tokens, critical checks in C++ and validated app store receipts.

#RSAC
Defrauding Your Customers
Seek out scams and use device ID to keep the fraudsters out.

#RSAC
Burning Down the Store
Mitigate malware attacks with secure coding practices.

Mitigate DDoS attacks with cloud-based services.

Peter Offringa Zoosk

"I wish we had put in better DDoS prevention. The size of site that's a target is getting smaller and smaller. Addressing an attack is not something you want to do on the fly."

#RSAC
6. Secure Coding
It's less effective and more costly to retrofit security.

#RSAC
Training
 check the size of user inputs  perform and document explicit error checking on all input  filter input streams for malicious characters or sequences  manage memory  sanitize output  initialize and clear variables  for SQL use stored procedures or pre-compiled
PREPAREDSTATEMENTs
Trainers: senior devs, outside experts, or online videos.

#RSAC
 Static Code Analysis  Dynamic Code Analysis  Third Party Libraries, SDKs, APIs

#RSAC
7. Secure the Internal Network
 Control and Visibility  Encrypted, Verified, Archived Backups  Collect and Read Logs for Devices, DNS, DHCP  Weekly Vulnerability and Port Scans  Automated and Manual Patching  Restrict and Monitor Admin Accounts  Funnel all Outgoing Data Through a Proxy  Penetration Testing

#RSAC
8. Physical Security
 Make people buzz in.  Sign in guests, issue them badges.  Put video surveillance in common
areas.  Clean your own server closet.

#RSAC
9. Plan for Failure
47 states have data breach notification laws, but most SMBs do not have a data breach plan.

#RSAC
10. Be Open With the Public
"...some users may have experienced isolated incidents of slow web page rendering."
"It was user error."
"It was our vendor's fault."
"We have no evidence that exposed data was used to harm our customers in any way."
