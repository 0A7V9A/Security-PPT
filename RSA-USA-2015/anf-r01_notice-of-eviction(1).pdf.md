Lessons Learned
 Incident response is often a marathon, not a sprint  Apply Occam's razor  Conduct root cause analysis  Don't throw the first punch unless you have a plan to win  Weekends are your friend  Order of execution for eviction steps is important
39

#RSAC
Conclusion
 Implement and practice targeted threat response plan  Accurately assess the threat and the risk to determine best
eviction strategy
 Ad-Hoc  Containment  Compartmented  Failover  Full Scope
 Improving defense = reducing time to detect and effort to respond
