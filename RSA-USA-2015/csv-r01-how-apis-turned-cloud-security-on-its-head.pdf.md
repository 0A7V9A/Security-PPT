Summary
 APIs and ecosystems are the life-blood of Cloud apps  Huge customer value but requires adapting to changing security landscape  Apps are designed to share data -- you can't avoid this reality  The app is the perimeter now -- asserting control from the data center is
no longer viable  Only strong as your weakest link -- the ecosystem matters  Get activity-level detail + metadata in order to be the master of this new
frontier
