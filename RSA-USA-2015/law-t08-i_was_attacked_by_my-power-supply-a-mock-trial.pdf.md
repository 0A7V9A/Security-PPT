The Villain

UPisUS
power to the people

#RSAC
A Villain Enters stage left
 UPisUS, headquartered in the Netherlands with the operations center in Belgium, doesn't handle credit cards.
 It doesn't keep its software up to date either.
 A known, but unpatched, vulnerability is exploited by Snidely Whiplash, a known villain.
 Snidely installs a program into UPisUS systems that he manages from afar.
 He discovers the authentication credentials that UPisUS uses to remotely access the environments of its clients to enable updating the software of its product.
 He attempts to connects into each of the systems of those clients and succeeds with Get The Point, a company headquartered in Sherwood, Arkansas.
 He installs scraping software in each point-of-sale system in each store worldwide.
 Fly away little credit cards, fly away.

#RSAC
Lawyers Appear center stage
 Get The Point spends 148 million dollars for investigation, notification, and corrective actions.
 It suffers a drop of 18% in consumer revenue.
 It engages the law firm of Everdeen & Snow to seek damages.
 E&S filed a lawsuit against UpisUS in federal court in the Northern District of California claiming that UPisUS was negligent in that it allowed its systems to be used as a platform for an attack against Get The Point.
 It seeks to recover the cost of investigation, notification, and corrective actions and recover the loss of revenue, $300 million in total.

#RSAC
What is discovered

An intrepid assessor and US citizen had been hired as a consultant working under an NDA...

...to perform a risk analysis, including a security vulnerability assessment, for UPisUS at their request a year prior to the incident. At the Operations Center in Belgium he interviews staff about their backgrounds and duties; observes staff performing their duties; and conducts tests.

Risk Analysis Report
for UPisUS
He delivers the only copy of the report to UPisUS headquarters in the Netherlands.

#RSAC
What has been illuminated
 The CIO of Get The Point has admitted during his deposition that the following controls mandated by the PCI Data Security Standard were not in place:
 Get The Point should have only allowed UPisUS to connect to Get The Point's systems after UPisUS's request was approved by Get the Point.
 Get The Point should have monitored all actions initiated by UPisUS while the connection is in place.
