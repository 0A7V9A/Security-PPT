 Contrary to limited use principle  How do we provide notice for unknown uses?  Who gets to determine benefit to consumer, citizen, society for

#RSAC
History Repeats Itself
 Debates about privacy are debates about technology in society  Society will continue to create normative values to respond  Law and policy will be woefully slow in documenting social norms  The result? Risk for public and private sector organizations that
get privacy wrong.
