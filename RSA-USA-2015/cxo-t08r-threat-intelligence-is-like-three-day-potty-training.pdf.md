#RSAC
Finding a particular set of skills is difficult
 Technical skills + soft skills required.  You must have a farm system to
develop talent with the skills you need.  Work with local universities
 Provide internships.  Join advisory boards.

 Written by Daniel Kahneman.  Kahneman reveals "where we
can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking."

Intel requirements are the foundation of your #RSAC program
 Occurs during the "Planning & Direction" phase of the intel cycle
 Develop requirements based upon:
 Your threat model  Understanding the success
criteria for your business

Developing intelligence requirements

#RSAC
Example intelligence requirements
 Have Chinese threat actors targeted health insurance provider x?
 What is likelihood that Lizard Squad will seek to disrupt the online gaming services of vendor x?
 What is the risk of adversary targeting the intellectual property associated with a 2017 product launch?

Platforms

 You need a quarterback to orchestrate your intelligence work.

 You don't manage threat intel, you analyze and integrate it.

46

#RSAC
Threat Intelligence Platform functions
 Ingest threat intelligence and normalize it.
 Rate intelligence sources (over time.)  Provide an analyst workspace.  Provide visualization and pivoting.  Provide enrichment.  Enable internal and external
collaboration/sharing.
47

#RSAC
Threat intelligence sharing
 Sharing alone does not a threat intel platform make.
 Sharing is a function of a threat intel platform.
 If you cannot take action on shared intel it has little value.
48

#RSAC
Speed of sharing
 "We need to close the gap between sharing speed and attack speed."
 "75% of attacks spread from Victim 0 to Victim 1 within one day (24 hours)."
49

#RSAC
STIX could be the answer
 STIX gained momentum in 2014, but still has a long way to go.
 Be on the look out for "checkbox STIX."
 Ask vendors what specific use cases do they support.

Oversight
51

#RSAC
Prepare for the Bobs
 How effective were your investments? Avoid Expense in Depth with after action reviews.
 Measure and track:
 Time to detection, containment, remediation.
 If you cannot measure these items, invest in the situational awareness technology required to do so.
52

#RSAC
Mature firms produce strategic intelligence
 Produce your own customized version of the Verizon DBIR.
 Produce daily digest of top cybersecurity stories and their impacts.
 Use strategic intelligence products to improve the external perspective of security.
53
