ON BUDGET

ACCEPTABLE QUALITY/RISK

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Dev's core motivations are to be OnTime, OnBudget, w/ Acceptable Quality/Risk @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
"Don't Go Chasin' Waterfalls" Dev started w/ Waterfall, but modern demands require us to go faster @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

ON TIME. Faster builds. Fewer interruptions. More innovation.

ON BUDGET. More efficient. More profitable. More competitive.

ACCEPTABLE QUALITY/RISK. Easier compliance. Higher quality. Built-in audit protection.

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Waterfall's Design -> Dev -> Test -> Deploy may go 1.5-3yrs b/w releases. @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

Agile made dev faster but wasn't enough. DevOps extends patterns to Ops 4 mutual gains @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

SW Supply Chains

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

SW Supply Chain

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

SW SupplyChains enable faster, more efficient dev by reducing elective complexity/risk++ @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

SW Supply Chains

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Our SW Supply Chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Can you say #OpenSSL? @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

DevOps Defined

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Is #DevOps a Culture? A Process? A Toochain? YES; but the greatest of these is Culture/Empathy @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
Myths abound RE: Security & #DevOps. We FUD-Haters should deal w/ facts @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
RE: #DevOps & Security: You're entitled to your own opinions, but not to your own facts. @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
MythBusted: "ITIL & ChangeMngt can't be done w/ #DevOps " <- It can even make it easier/better @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
True #DevOps + Security isn't all rainbows & unicorns. Unicorn p00p has to be worked thru @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

SW Status Quo: Most attacked; least spend

Worse, w/in Software, existing dollars go to the <= 10% written

spending

attack risk

People Security ~$4B

Written Code Scanning

Software Security ~$0.5B

Data Security ~$5B
Host Security ~$10B

Assembled 3rd Party & OpenSource Components

~90% of most applications

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Network Security ~$20B

Almost No Spending

StatusQuo: SW is MOST attacked & gets LEAST SecSpend; most on 10% of code we write @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps
Source: Normalized CObIT spending across IDC, Gartner, The 451 Group; since groupings vary

Insanity

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

Einstein's Insanity: We could do the same thing over & over expecting different results @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
WRT Security & #DevOps We lose things AND we gain things. We'll look at 5 things we gain @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
This was added b/c the Red Hat in the "Lost & Found" made @mortman giggle & he forced it upon @joshcorman #RSAC #DevOps

1) Instrumentation

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

1) Instrumentation! #DevOps instruments EVERYTHING & Security can use it in MANY ways @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

2) Be Mean To Your Code!

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman

2) Be Mean To Your Code! To avoid failure; fail all the time #ChaosMonkey #Gauntlt #BrakeMan @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
3) Complexity Is Enemy of "All The Things"! All #DevOps parties benefit from reducing complexity @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
Decomposition lowers complexity adds security and reliability @mortman @joshcorman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
Simple > Complex. Simple != Easy though. There is no easy button, but there is an easiER one. @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
4) Implicit and Explicit Change Management. Change is good and leads to stability and fights stagnation. @joshcorman @mortman #rsac #devops

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
All of Chuck Norris's Change Controls are Full Cycle and they're always approved! @joshcorman @mortman #RSAC #DevOps

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
5) Empathy is the killer app! Silos prohibit sharing and empathy.... #RSAC #DevOps @mortman @joshcorman

#RSAC @mortman @joshcorman
Madame CISO, Tear Down This Wall! #RSAC #DevOps @mortman @joshcorman
