Insider Threats
Don't turn your back on this notorious crew!

I use my cat's name as my password for
EVERYTHING!

My secret to job security? I'm the only one in the company with full administrative rights on the network. I DARE YOU to fire me!

I OPENED A ZIP FILE emailed from my old college roommate today
and it crashed my machine. SO ANNOYING!

#RSAC

I`m addicted to this ONLINE GAMBLING site in
MOLDOVA. I'm behind on my mortgage ­ but I know I
can win it all back during lunch today!!

UNDER MY DESK.

I downloaded the entire contents of our CRM and
saved it to Dropbox ­ JUST IN CASE!

#RSAC
External attackers get all the press, but it's the insiders you need to worry about
 Current or former employees responsible for 66% of security incidents  84% of all attacks for financial gain are "non-technical"  Vast majority of attacks involve compromised credentials  90% of data breaches were preventable  More than 90% of security spend focused on perimeter protection

Risk Reduction Measures

#RSAC
How NOT to Address Insider Risks
 Create a police state that conveys you don't trust your employees  Severely punish well-intended employees who make a mistake  Impose disproportionate controls that impede effectiveness more than
reduce risks  BLINDLY BUY MORE TOOLS!
19

#RSAC
Simple Steps to Reduce Risk
1. Educate and engage senior executives in driving cultural change
2. Strictly limit number of privileged users and carefully consider segregation of duties
3. Transform vulnerabilities into fortifications through awareness training
4. Deploy intelligent behavioral monitoring technology to detect risky behavior by insiders (and vendors)
5. Implement and enforce clear, simple and DEFENSIBLE policies and controls
20

Conclusions/Next Steps

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Next week you should:
- Identify the key stakeholders needed to address insider threat risks
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
- Convene a meeting of key stakeholders to define a process to assess insider risks
- Identify technology that could support your insider risk management program
 Within six months you should:
- Have a roadmap for reducing and controlling insider risks - Implement an awareness program to introduce new insider risk
measures

CERT Recommendations
11. Institutionalize system change controls. 12. Use a log correlation engine or security information and event management (SIEM) system to log,
monitor, and audit employee actions. 13. Monitor and control remote access from end points, including mobile devices. 14. Develop a comprehensive employee termination procedure. 15. Implement secure backup and recovery processes. 16. Develop a formalized insider threat program. 17. Establish a baseline of normal network device behavior. 18. Be especially vigilant regarding social media. 19. Close the doors to unauthorized data exfiltration.
