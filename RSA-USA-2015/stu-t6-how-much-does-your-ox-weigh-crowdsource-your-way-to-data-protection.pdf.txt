Yes, we are the best but..
 We don't have endless budget  We don't have all the time in the world  We don't have all the people we need  We don't know everything...
 We always need to do more, with less

Francis Galton
 He was a knight!  He visited a livestock fair in 1906  An Ox was on display  800 people tried to guess "How much does the
Ox weigh?" No one could. Not even the experts  But, the mean of the guesses was correct  Sir Francis Galton discovered the wisdom
of the crowd

Now let's do the same thing, together!

"Crowdsourcing America's cybersecurity is an idea so crazy it might just work."

Did I say that?
 There is no need to chase the expert  The right information needs to be delivered to the right people
in the right place, at the right time, and in the right way  Information aggregation functionality is needed

Crowdsourcing your data security

#RSAC
What can you do?
 Short-term:
 Identify data security processes that depends on context and business knowledge, such as: Data ownership, Data classification and Access policies.
 Add business users to these processes.  Discover ways to help business and facilitate win/win.
 Medium-long term:
 Make the users your first line of defense.  Gather data security and security education into a single channel.  Reward users for taking an active role, make them your heroes.
