#RSAC
Motivation for this Research
 Most security professionals struggle with metrics and reporting  Board level executives don't often know what they need  CISO's often don't know what Board members want  No CISO playbook for metrics and reporting exists  We want to change this by closer aligning security and business

Research Results:

#RSAC

90 CISOs Point of View

#RSAC
Research Results: What We Already Knew
 All CISOs have to address 3 questions:
 What do I need to know?  Why does it matter? / What do I care?  What do you need from me?
 This is both SIMPLE and HARD!

#RSAC
Research Results: Tenure
 20% have been in the CISO role < 12 months.  New focus by Board in Security changing their priorities  1/5 of CISOs are looking to validate their programs / guidance

#RSAC
Research Results: Area of Focus
 15% report mostly on specific project status  20% are discussing Compliance Audits  25% are talking about Incident Response capabilities  49% are reporting on Vulnerability Management

#RSAC
Research Results: Tangible & Obscure
 6% report on "Volume of Spam Blocked"  12% report no metrics to their Board  Also responded w/ "lost laptops/iPads" and "website blocking"  Many CISOs grasp for topics to connect with their Boards

Affecting Change:

#RSAC

Rapid7's Research Project

#RSAC
Affecting Change: Expanding the Survey
 A Quantitative and Qualitative Survey  Need > 250 CISOs and Non-Security Executives  Takes less than 15 minutes of someone's time  Results in an open source "Playbook" for CISOs
 What should be reported? (Routine vs. Special Requests)  Mapping to Common Security Frameworks

#RSAC
Affecting Change: Take it Yourself / Contribute
 Please take 15 minutes to complete the survey TODAY
bit.ly/CISOSurvey2015
 Then, pass it along:
 2 security colleagues  3 non-security colleagues!

#RSAC
How to Apply What You've Learned
 Today you should:
 Take Rapid7's CISO Reporting Survey
 In the next two week:
 Evaluate what your teams are reporting  Think about how non-security executives will consume the results  Modify your metrics and report to focus more on business risk
 In the next 3 months:
 Contact the consumers of your updated reports  Ask for feedback vs. previous months / years
