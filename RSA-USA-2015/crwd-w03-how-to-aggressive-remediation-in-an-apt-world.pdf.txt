Why Aggressive Remediation?

Repeated breaches by the same advanced attackers

A breach that has gone undetected for weeks or months

HOW TO: Aggressive Remediation
 Traditional IR models versus Advanced Attack models  What is eradication?  The two eradication models
- Sequential eradication - Event-focused eradication
 How do you chose which model to employ  Considerations for success!

Incident Response (IR) Models

Traditional IR
Phase 1 Investigation

Phase 2 Containment

Advance Attack IR

Phase 1 Investigation

Phase 2 Containment

Phase 3 Remediation

Phase 3 Expulsion

Phase 4 Remediation

Eradication

Sequential

Event-focused
7

#RSAC
Sequential Eradication

 Attackers tools are eliminated quickly
 Risk of loss/damage may be lower
 Cost is lower

 Loss of critical data on attacker tactics
 Attackers may go quiet making it more difficult to find their tools
 Investigative resources may be shifted to eradication
 Risks retaliatory damage

8

#RSAC
Event-focused Eradication

 Better understanding of attackers tools, tactics, targets and motivations
 Minimizes retaliatory risk

 Requires extensive planning and sophisticated execution
 Requires sophisticated approaches to reduce data loss
 Cost is usually higher

9

#RSAC
Considerations for Choosing Approach

Organization's risk tolerance
Ability to lock down active directory (AD)
Ability to scan for attacker's tools

Depth and breadth of entrenchment
Ability to validate removal of
attacker's tools

Confidence in containment
approach
Network security monitoring capabilities
Sufficient staff & expertise to plan and
manage complex execution

10

#RSAC
HOW TO: Tips for Success
Detailed planning Prep and stage resources Communicate with law enforcement and other partners Ensure robust network security monitoring is in-place Develop eradication scripts and test them in lab Scan, scan and rescan to validate removal of attacker's tools Sufficient staff & expertise to plan and manage complex execution

HOW TO: Don't Be A Repeat Victim!
Add an eradication step to your IR plan Train and exercise for eradication Engage IR SMEs to guide your effort
