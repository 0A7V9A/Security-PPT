Strategic Thinking
 Social media: powerful technology / human-to-human
 New "Wild West", "cyber battleground"
 Network life and human life: close relationship
 Everything on social media: good and bad
 Packets flying in every direction, all the time
 Apps, profiles, content, images, video, links, malware, threats, gossip!
 Defense: comprehensive approach: think Art of War
 Awareness, concepts, geopolitics, sensitivity, wisdom
 Social media security: abusing trust ... nurturing trust
 Know trends in technology / communicate with human users
30

#RSAC
Practical Application
 Visibility
 Websites, IP addresses, traffic patterns, software / malware
 Free speech ­ but not to a fault!
 No inflammatory, violent content / no dangerous sites
 Tailored tactics: your organization is unique
 Flexible, dynamic, imaginative defense
 Proactive measures
 Policy, enforcement, briefings by law enforcement, counterintelligence
 Reactive preparations
 Plans for attack mitigation, remediation
