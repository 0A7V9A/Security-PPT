Building A Business Risk Portfolio

Document business objectives

Identify risks that
could prevent attaining objectives

Classify risks by probability
and severity

Map risks and set
risk tolerance

Develop, document
riskreduction strategies

Review risk
portfolio and revise as needed

#RSAC
Document Business Objectives
Increase market share by offering cutting-edge services
Increase revenue by expanding globally
Maintain sterling reputation
Increase margins by greater efficiency

#RSAC
Identify Risks

Start with business objectives

Assign subjectmatter experts (facilities, economics, politics, etc.)

SMEs create list of risks

Assess positive as
well as negative risks

Classify Risks By Probability and Impact

#RSAC

Probability
 Unlikely: Less than 1% chance of occurring within timeframe
 Likely: 1% to 10% chance of occurring within timeframe
 Highly likely: 10% or more chance of occurring within timeframe

Classify Risks By Probability and Impact

#RSAC

Probability

Impact

 Unlikely: Less than 1% chance of occurring within timeframe
 Likely: 1% to 10% chance of occurring within timeframe
 Highly likely: 10% or more chance of occurring within timeframe

 Level 1: Not severe; minimal impact
 Level 2: Moderately severe; upsets operations
 Level 3: Severe, significantly disruptive
 Level 4: Extremely severe, threatens existence of organization
 Level 5: Catastrophic, will destroy organization

Classification Best Practices
Include a defined, consistent time horizon Resist temptation to get too granular Consider a weighted-scorecard approach Only convert to dollars if your cost model is bulletproof
Assess probabilities of individual risks, compute categories
