Lessons learned today?
 Classification in Protection Classes eases the selection of appropriate security solutions for the Mobile Enterprise
 Within the same organization, domains and devices of different Protection Classes can co-exist.
 Consumer-level devices can be enhanced by intelligent integration of smart components for use in the Mobile Enterprise
 Germany deployed public eco-systems provide a good set of bestpractice examples
