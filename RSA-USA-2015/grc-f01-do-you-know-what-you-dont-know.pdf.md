Apply Slide
 Next week you should:
 Identify where unknowns are hiding within your organization
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Understand where your organization fits into the proposed model  Develop a plan to push your organization to the upper right quadrant
 Within six months you should:
 Begin the execution of your plan, managing the unknowns rather than focusing just on what you know
 Demonstrate to peers and seniors how this methodology can work for other areas of risk management

#RSAC
Some Axioms
You cannot protect assets you don't know about.
You cannot defend against threats you are unaware of.

The Quote
"...there are known knowns; there are things that we know that we know. "We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. "But there are also the unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know."
-Donald Rumsfeld, 2002

Is Cyber Risk Something That

#RSAC

Can Be Measured?

 Perhaps, but you first have to define "risk"

 Some say it is this:
Risk = Threats X Vulnerabilities X Impact  What numbers do you use? What does it mean?
 Others say risk is related to uncertainty
 If you can determine with precision the outcome of a series of events, then the risk of something else happening is low
 Does that mean that jumping out of airplane at 10,000 feet without a parachute is not a risky venture?

#RSAC
Perhaps Risk is Something Else
 In the Market, risk is the potential of losing something of value weighed against the potential to gain something of value
 Another approach is to let risk be a function of what you don't know
 How do you determine what you don't know?  Can you measure how much you don't know?  What about not knowing about what you don't know?

#RSAC
Cyber Risk is Everywhere (what we DO know)
 Insiders doing legitimate work insecurely  Outsiders interacting with our systems  Technology innovation and change  IT supply chain complexity  Old protocols and assumptions  Government regulation  Determined adversaries

Guidance From a Security Professional for

#RSAC

Measuring Cyber Risk (Focused on Knowns)

 "Quarterly Statement of Risk which outlines all the risks that have been identified for that quarter and any exceptions granted so that senior management can understand how much risk they have."
 "Monthly Vulnerability Report that gets delivered to all levels within the enterprise with specific remediation metrics such as 30, 60, 90 days for high, medium and low risks."
 "Monthly Exception Report that shows how many policy exceptions have been requested, how many have been granted, and when they expire."
 "Access Review Summary for all applications that house highly confidential data, which details who has access to what, for what reason and has an audit trail back to the date of employment."
 "A Monthly Incident Report should be delivered to senior management that shows how often the enterprise comes under attack and the kinds of attacks they are under."

An Example of What We Know:

#RSAC

The 2014 Verizon DBIR Findings

#RSAC
2010 DBIR: The Unknown Unknowns
 In nearly half of Verizon's 2009 cases, investigators observed what were not so affectionately called the "unknown unknowns."
 These were classified as meeting at least one of the following conditions:
 Assets unknown or unclaimed by the organization (or business group affected)
 Data the organization did not know existed on a particular asset  Assets that had unknown network connections or accessibility  Assets that had unknown user accounts or privileges

#RSAC
Measuring the Unknowns
 We have found that rather than counting what you know, risk management works best when you identify and reduce what you don't know
 A personal example:
 When was the last time a house in your neighborhood caught fire?  Do you know how long it takes for a fire truck to arrive?  Do you know if your nearest fire hydrant has water in it?
 These are the unknowns ­ you want to identify and convert them into knowns

Dangerous Unknowns: The Case of the

#RSAC

Cisco T1 WAN Interface Line Card

 Networking department wants to purchase a new WAN interface card to update their Cisco 1760 routers
 They recommend the WIC-1DSU-T1-V2 card  Cisco suggested retail price is about $1000
 Recommendation is approved and the parts request goes to the ordering department
 Ordering department, knowing that the organization is not made of money, goes online to research a few sources
 Let's see what they find....

One More Example Of An Unknown:

#RSAC

What The Heck Is BASH?

 Prior to September 26, 2014 only the Unix crowd (and a few Microsoft fans) were familiar with the Bourne Again Shell
 But none had any idea that an enormous security hole had been lying inside of BASH waiting to be discovered for over 20 years
 In late September millions of businesses had to scramble to figure out if they were vulnerable and how to fix the problem

 The BASH problem came only weeks after the Heartbleed issue in OpenSSL, another "unknown" concern

Perhaps a Model Will Help:

#RSAC

Knowns vs. Unknowns

 Make an assertion: there are things we know and things we do not know about cyber risks
 Plot a range of knowledge about cyber risk (y-axis):  We know little to nothing about cyber risks (low)  We know a lot or everything about cyber risks (high)
 Then, plot how much we know about the risks we can identify (x-axis):  We know risky things exist, but we don't know a lot about those risks (low)  We know risky things exist, and we know a lot about those risks (high)

Knowns vs. Unknowns

We don't know much about risks that are identifiable

#RSAC
Upper Right Quadrant
 Known Knowns  You are aware of risks, and you know a lot about them
 Sources:  Internal/external audit results  Business records  Lawsuits  Press (good and bad)  Measured impact of service loss
 This is where you want to be  Requires high competence and plenty of resources

#RSAC
Lower Right Quadrant
 Known Unknowns
 You know what can cause risk, but you don't know if you have any of those risks
 Types:
 Counterfeit/inferior hardware  Social media postings  Unauthorized software  New versions of malware or phishing  Intentions of malicious insiders
 This is typical of well educated but understaffed CISOs
 Can be improved with additional resources

#RSAC
Upper Left Quadrant
 Unknown Knowns
 Knowledge about risk is available, but you are not aware that these resources can uncover hidden risks
 Resources:
 System and machine logs  Calls to the help desk  Internal discussions  Lessons learned but not shared  Encrypted data/files
 This is typical of large, decentralized organizations
 Data is everywhere, but not being mined for indicators

#RSAC
Lower Left Quadrant
 Unknown Unknowns
 You don't know what risks exist, and you don't know where to start looking for them
 Risks you may not know about:
 How long to recover from failure  Existence of undocumented devices,
networks, software, or data  Dependencies on others  Former employee accounts  Zero-days in software you have never heard of
 This is where too many organizations find themselves
 They are only paying attention to the things they know

Example: Data Breaches

#RSAC

 Unknown Unknown: You have no idea what the term "data breach" means
 Unknown Known: Your organization has been breached and your computers are aware of the breach, but you are not
 Known Unknown: You have read about others getting breached and understand the implications of a breach, but you do not know if you have been breached
 Known Known: Your systems immediately alert you to a breach, you have planned for and have processes to contain breaches, and you fully understand the potential impact of a breach

Side Case: Are We Sometimes Over Confident? #RSAC
 What happens when there are things you think you know, but it turns out you did not know them or your information was wrong?
 Total number of edge devices in your network  Complete and accurate list of all users  Supply sources of all equipment  Locations of all network connections, down to the cable  Names of highly trusted individuals with full access to sensitive systems  Time that it takes to detect and mitigate an incident
 This would be similar to a False Negative situation on an IDS or firewall
 Bad passes through the control, but is marked as good  Leads to a false sense of confidence
 Some might say this is a variant of the "unknown known" case
 It is certainly the worst case scenario, since you believe all is well but it's not  Perhaps we could call it the "not-known known" case

Goal: Be More Secure Today

#RSAC

Than You Were Yesterday

 Incidents by themselves are not a metric
 Avoid focusing on how many incidents happened last year  Likewise, reporting the number of alerts, warnings, bulletins, etc.
produced is not a measure of security
 Focus instead on awareness and reduction of the unknowns
 Bonus: identify and reduce the unknown unknowns

 Since you cannot measure what you don't know, get rid of the unknowns!
