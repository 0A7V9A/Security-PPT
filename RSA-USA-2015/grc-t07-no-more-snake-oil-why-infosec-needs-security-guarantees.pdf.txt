Security Industry Spends Billions
"According to the IT research and advisory firm [Gartner], global IT security spending will reach $71.1 billion this year [2014], which represents an increase of 7.9% compared to 2013. Next year, spending will grow even more, reaching $76.9 billion."

Result: Every Year is the Year of the Hack
In 2014, 71% of security professionals said their networks were breached. 22% of them victimized 6 or more times. This increased from 62% and 16% respectively from 2013.
52% said their organizations will likely be successfully hacked in the next 12 months. This is up from 39% in 2013.

Downside Protection
As of 2014, American businesses were expected to pay up to $2 billion on cyber-insurance premiums, a 67% spike from $1.2 billion spent in 2013.
Current expectations by one industry watcher suggest 100% growth in insurance premium activity, possibly 130% growth.
It's usually the firms that are best prepared for cyber attacks that wind up buying insurance.

"Premiums for a $1 million plan are generally $5,000 to $10,000 annually, though that can vary based on several factors, including the company's revenue, cyber-risk management efforts and the coverage chosen, Fenaroli said. For hospitals, premiums can be much larger-- sometimes more than $100,000 or even $1 million for larger health systems, he said."

Sony Pictures Entertainment holds $60 million in Cyber insurance with Marsh, according to documents leaked by the group claiming responsibility for the attack on the movie studio.
"The documents, covered in detail by Steve Ragan at CSO, say that after sonypictures.com was breached in 2011, Sony made a claim of $1.6 million with Hiscox, its Cyber provider at the time. The insurer declined to quote at renewal, so Sony Pictures turned to Lockton, which brokered a $20 million policy that included $10 million in self-insured retention."

"Target spent $248 million after hackers stole 40 million payment card accounts and the personal information of up to 70 million customers. The insurance payout, according to Target, will be $90 million."
"Home Depot reported $43 million in expenses related to its September 2014 hack, which affected 56 million credit and debit card holders. Insurance covered only $15 million."

"Anthem has $150 million to $200 million in cyber coverage, including excess layers, sources say." Insurers providing excess layers of cyber coverage include: Lloyd's of London syndicates; operating units of Liberty Mutual Holding Co.; Zurich Insurance Group; and CNA Financial Corp., sources say.

"Liability enforcement is essential. Remember that I said the costs of bad security are not borne by the software vendors that produce the bad security. In economics this is known as an externality: a cost of a decision that is borne by people other than those making the decision.
However it happens, liability changes everything. Currently, there is no reason for a software company not to offer more features, more complexity, more versions. Liability forces software companies to think twice before changing something. Liability forces companies to protect the data they're entrusted with."

Objections to Security Guarantees
"You're not entitled to take a view, unless and until you can argue better against that view than the smartest guy who holds that opposite view. If you can argue better than the smartest person who holds the opposite view, that is when you are entitled to hold a certain view."
Charlie Munger Vice-Chairman Berkshire Hathaway

#RSAC
Objection:
100% security is impossible.
Rebuttal: Nothing is ever 100% secure, just like no every-day product is 100% reliable. With product performance data, even if unable to provide 100% protection, offering security guarantees is possible.
18

#RSAC
Objection:
Guarantees can't keep up.
Rebuttal: It's contractually possible to specify exactly what a security guarantee covers and disclaim excessively risky events and unknowns. Insurance companies do this routinely.
19

#RSAC
Objection:
Vendors don't have the data.
Rebuttal: Today we're in the era of the cloud, managed services, and products routinely phoning home for updates, all providing real-time access to an ample supply of performance data.
20

#RSAC
Objection:
Pinpointing product failure is difficult.
Rebuttal: For organizations capable of performing effective forensic investigations, identifying the gap in the defense or the product that failed, is entirely possible.
21

#RSAC
Objection:
Soft costs are hard to quantify.
Rebuttal: Security guarantees and cyber-security insurance typically cover only hard costs associated with downtime, legal feels, incident response, credit monitoring, fines, and so on.
22

#RSAC
Objection:
Security vendors don't want the liability.
Rebuttal: Security guarantees represent a unique opportunity for vendors to differentiate from competitors and an opportunity for customers to demand more effective products.
23

#RSAC
Objection:
Improper product use is often the cause.
Rebuttal: Like many other products we buy, guarantees only covers intended use. Security vendors can specify how their product is meant to be used for its effectiveness to be guaranteed.

"We also asked about the importance of being offered a `security guarantee' by cloud service providers. Three-quarters of respondents (74%) say it's `Very Important' that cloud providers offer a guarantee, and another 22% say `Somewhat Important.' Companies not using cloud place a greater importance on security guarantees than current users. As such, security guarantees give cloud service providers an opportunity to attract new customers."

Customer challenges...
 Difficult telling security vendors apart.
Security guarantees help customers differentiate truly effective security products from those that are...less effective.
 Justifying the business value of security products to management.
Security guarantees help quantify the value of security products in dollars and cents for the business.
 Trusting security vendors since their interests are misaligned.
Security guarantees hold vendors accountable for the performance of their products and therefore more credible.

Path for Other Security Vendors to Follow
 Obtain as much performance data as possible  Contractually capture what your product is able to reliably
guarantee and disclaim the rest.  Back your security guarantee with an insurance provider.
