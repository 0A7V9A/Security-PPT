Typical lawyer disclaimer
Nothing said during this presentation should be considered legal advice. This is intended to be nothing more than a general analysis of broad legal principles in a scholastic setting. Legal advice is properly provided only when it is more finely attuned to specific facts and specific issues in a specific, real-life situation, which will not be provided at this presentation. When seeking legal advice in this area of law, look to counsel who is both knowledgeable in this area of law and fully understands how your business or enterprise operates.

2014 ­ "Year of the Breach"

#RSAC

· Started with consequences of the Target hack (currently estimated at over 110 million accounts breached)
· First of several POS attacks
· Neiman-Marcus, Michaels, PF Chang's
· Couple of Russian teens accused of creating malware called Black POS
· C-suite members lost jobs
· Massive lawsuits pending
· By the time of the Home Depot breach, people were bored with the story

#RSAC
Then along came Sony and the Guardians of Peace
· Series of financial institution attacks from summer-fall 2014
· The year ends with a major media cyberattack ­ Sony's media group
· Dispute over whether North Koreansponsored or insider attack
· Purportedly malware attack ­ Destover
· Once through the firewall, accessed numerous areas of the network
· Contracts, scripts, employee health information, internal emails

#RSAC
Spurring government to respond
· White House press release ­ 1/13/15 (reiterated at 1/20 State of Union address)
· Cybersecurity solutions a centerpiece of his agenda going forward
· Claims enhanced legislation, funding, enforcement all coming
· A proposal with support of "both sides of the aisle"
· New agencies and proposals already begun in 2015

#RSAC
Even in my home state
· NY ­ the financial capital of the world
· AG notes there is currently no law in NY requiring businesses to institute cyber security
· Also proposes expanding the categories of data that must be protected to include email passwords, among others
· Also proposes HIPAA-type data protection
· Point is ­ 2015 is going to be a year of increased regulation (and probably for the next several years ahead)

#RSAC
Let's start with healthcare regulation
· Currently, the 800 pound gorilla in the room
· First area of US privacy protection to go to such length and depth
· Significant monetary penalties
· Substantial enforcement resources
· Wasn't always the case
· The evolution of healthcare regulation is significant
· Demonstrates the road ahead for other areas of data privacy regulation that are not yet at HIPAA-level protections
10

#RSAC
HIPAA doesn't exist in a vacuum
· We tend to look at single industry solutions in US

· But privacy regulations do not exist in a vacuum

· Statutes/regulations build on each other

· HIPAA had many deficiencies

· But Congress learned from these inadequacies

· Stole a number of concepts from elsewhere and will be the source of corrective measures in other areas of privacy regulation

· Helps to understand the privacy/security

industry in its entirety to see how these laws &

regulations have evolved and will continue to

evolve

#RSAC
Problem getting VERY serious ­ Part 1
· Right now the bad guys are winning and winning big
· 60 Minutes episode from Nov. 30, 2014
· Cybersecurity expert claims 97% of all businesses will have their systems breached in 2015
· What's the typical response
· Regulatory penalties, civil lawsuits, loss of reputation, loss of revenue
· E.g., Target is fending off at least 111 lawsuits from customers, banks and shareholders
12

#RSAC
Problem getting VERY serious ­ Part 2
· According to this article
· 90% of healthcare organizations have reported at least 1 data breach in the past 2 years
· More than 1/3 have reported MORE THAN FIVE!!!
· The URL for this story is: http://www.healthcareitnews.c om/news/HIPAA-breachresponse-tipsexperts?topic=18,30
13

#RSAC
Problem getting VERY serious ­ Part 3
· Title notes global $445 billion lost annually in trade theft & WILL WORSEN
· Taken from June, 2014 report of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
· The URL for the report is: http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/ reports/rp-economic-impactcybercrime2.pdf
· The URL for this story is: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014 -06-09/cybercrime-remains-growthindustry-with-445-billion-lost.html
14

Sometime the problem is not knowing where data #RSAC sits
· Affinity Health Plan from NY
· Leased 4 copiers
· Confidential ePHI was stored on copiers' hard drives
· Copiers returned to distributor at end of lease ­ no one thought to check the hard drives
· CBS Evening News bought one of the used hard drives & discovered the data
· Conducted an investigation & revealed the incident to Affinity who reported breach to HHS/OCR
15

#RSAC
"C-suite" getting worried?
· Good news/bad news · CIOs under greater fire · Target's was fired · Even Target's CEO was
asked to leave over this · But events like these also
justify bigger budgets · To fend off cyber-attacks
16

#RSAC
Largest US HIPAA assessment to date? May of 2014
$4.8 MILLION ­ NY Presbyterian & Columbia University Hospitals
· Joint settlement ­ largest US HIPAA penalty
· NY Pres allows Columbia docs to work there
· Columbia physician attempts to deactivate a personal computer on the hospital network
· Results in the inadvertent disclosure of 6800 Presbyterian Hospital patients' info on the Net
· Included patients' status, vital signs, meds & lab results
· $3.3 million for NY Presbyterian & 1.5 million for Columbia, plus corrective action plans which includes risk analysis and management plan, staff training, written policies and procedures creation 17

#RSAC
Biggest HIPAA assessment ANYWHERE
$6.8 MILLION HIT IN PUERTO RICO
· Medical insurer inadvertently released PHI
· Only 13,336 identities exposed in 2013
· Fine amounted to $500 per exposed identity
· Also got hit for $100,000 for not cooperating
· Ricardo Rivera Cardona, Director of the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration (ASES in Spanish) said it could have been much more
· His agency had the authority to fine up to $100,000 for every exposed identity
· Sharks smell blood ­ this insurer recently admitted to Absolute they've suffered over 80 audits in the past year
18

Why are privacy violations becoming more frequent #RSAC (and expensive)?
Minn. Attorney General Lori Swanson
· What happened to Accretive Health a perfect example · HITECH Act authorized States' AGs to bring actions · Accretive Business Associate to 2 Minnesota Hospitals · Stolen unencrypted laptop contained personal healthcare info of 23,500 patients · Condition of settlement ­ Accretive may not operate in Minnesota for AT LEAST 2 years beginning July,
2012 · Can be up to 6 years based on yearly review by Minnesota AG · Estimated loss of revenue from Minnesota ­ $22-25 million per year · Total current loss ­ over $70 million AND COU1N9 TING

#RSAC

Health Insurance and Portability Accountability Act #RSAC (HIPAA) basics
· Created a "Privacy Rule"
· Can be found at: 45 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) §164.500 et.sec.
· Under the Privacy Rule, ALL forms of Protected Health Information (PHI) must be kept private (written, oral, digital, etc.)
· Created a "Security Rule"
· 45 CFR §164.300 et.sec.
· Security Rule only requires electronic PHI (ePHI) be kept secure
· But as originally enacted in 1996 ­ a toothless tiger

#RSAC
What exactly is PHI?
· Info about a patient's past, present or future mental or physical health or any billing or payment
· Which can be connected to a specific patient
· By any one of 18 identifiers specified in the statute
· All your common identifiers · But the 18th identifier leaves the
possibilities completely open-ended

What changed so much with

#RSAC

HIPAA?

· Welcome to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ­ enacted in 2009
· Corrected many of the deficiencies of HIPAA ­ partly based on advances in other areas of privacy/security law
· Important move was to leave flexibility with HHS to enact modifying regulations with the creation of the Omnibus Final Rule which went into effect September 23, 2013

#RSAC
Overview of HITECH-OFR enhancements
· Many more entities now required to comply (not just "Covered Entities" but also "Business Associates and their subcontractors")
· $ amount of civil penalties & fines GREATLY increased (from max of $50,000 per violation to $1.5 million per violation PER YEAR)
· Enforcement agencies now specified & numerous (State Attorneys Generals added to federal Department of Health & Human Services)
· Burden of proof shifted ­ data out of control of an authorized person is now presumed a breach, unless it can be shown there's a "low probability protected data was lost"
· Created the Breach Notification Rule ­ 45 CFR §164.400 et.sec.
· Entities now required to come forward with announcing breaches
· Mostly due to HITECH/OFR, enforcement & penalty $$ increased

One of the possible misconceptions if you only look #RSAC at HITECH and not regs issued afterwards
· It gets said at HIPAA training sessions & by "C Suite" executives
· If you only read the HITECH Act, you could be led to believe that
· Be very, very careful here ­ just because someone says it so, doesn't make it true
· Not aware of any court or administrative decision holding that way yet
· Must resort to reviewing statutory/regulatory language

#RSAC
When encryption is not enough?
· Those who claim encryption is a safe harbor to HIPAA regulation should read 74 Federal Register 79 ­ issued 4/27/09
· Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies That Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals
· At page 19009 ­ "(a) Electronic PHI has been encrypted as specified in the HIPAA Security Rule by `the use of an algorithmic process to transform data into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key' and such confidential process or key that might enable decryption has not been breached."

What ways can encryption be

#RSAC

decrypted?

"Hello"

%D¨FT%$D
Encrypted text

"Hello"

SENDER

ENCRYPTION
Recipient's public key

· Brute force attack ­ very rare

DECRYPTION
Recipient's public key

RECIPIENT

· Sticky note on device ­ much more common

· Mistakenly granted administrative rights ­ disturbing way too common

· Device stolen by someone who knows the decryption key ­ also quite common

#RSAC
Expansion of entities covered by HIPAA / HITECH

Covered Entity Business Associate

Liability & Satisfactory Assurances

Subcontractor(s)

Notification

· HIPAA applied only to "Covered Entities" ­ your basic healthcare providers · One attempt to avoid HIPAA compliance was to pass duties off to 3rd parties
· HITECH & OFR extended compliance to "Business Associates" & their Subcontractors
· Covered Entities can potentially be financially liable for violations done by their downstream

What is a Business Associate?
· No easy answer
· Guidance found in 45 CFR §160.103
· Any organizations which "receive, create, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity"
· "functions and activities include: claims processing or administration; data analysis, processing or administration; utilization review; quality assurance; billing; benefit management; practice management; and repricing"
· "services are: legal; actuarial; accounting; consulting; data aggregation; management; administrative; accreditation; and financial"
· A Covered Entity CAN be a Business Associate of another Covered Entity
· This mean once labeled a Covered Entity DOESN'T mean you're always that
· So IMPORTANT query for Covered Entities ­ if YOU love a particular solution, and YOU'RE financially liable for the breaches of your downstream, why isn't YOUR DOWNSTREAM required to use your solution?

#RSAC

#RSAC
Now a written relationship with Business Associate
· Not just liability flows downstream
· Business Associate & Covered Entity must have written agreement
· Can be a contract, can just be an agreement
· Written agreement must set forth BA's supervision of its subcontractors
· Supervision extends beyond simply having an agreement

#RSAC
What about other areas of privacy law?
· To make an evolutionary analogy here · The post-HITECH era has quickly evolved HIPAA · Moving from adolescence to adulthood · For virtually all of the remaining areas of US law · The stage of evolution is not nearly as advanced · More like moving from toddler to childhood · But remember, HIPAA evolved, in part, by learning
from others · One has to assume the others will also follow
HIPAA · Plus, we've already seen evidence of this
31

#RSAC
The other current big dog in the fight? The FTC
· 2006, ChoicePoint paid a fine of $10 mil to the FTC and a $5 mil fund for victims
· The data warehouser sold info from over 163,000 of its customers to an alleged crime ring
· Has used it authority under Section 5 of the FTC which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices to reach over 50 settlements similar to the one in the Accretive Health case.
· The only area of compliance law/regulation currently under litigation in the US court system claim FTC lacks authority to do this
· 2 lower federal decisions have supported the FTC, one case recently affirmed by the respective Circuit Court of Appeal
32

The FTC is seeking to spread its wings
· It claims authority under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act to enact its own Security Rule to be enforced against non-banking financial institutions and demand privacy compliance
· In 2010, authority extended to health care providers not covered by HIPAA
· Also claims it is empowered by the Child Online Privacy Protection Act to require reasonable security for info collected only about children
· In Senate testimony in April, 2014, FTC Commissioner Edith Ramirez, requested federal legislation to strengthen its existing authority governing data security standards on companies, to impose civil penalties against violating companies and to mandate breach notification
33

#RSAC

What's ahead ­ A SLEW of US regulatory initiatives ­ #RSAC the SEC
· Speech given by Luis A. Aguilar, SEC Commissioner on 6/10/14 at the NYSE
· "Cyber Risks and the Boardroom" · Warning that SEC will become
increasingly interested in how boards respond to cyber threats · Boards MUST go beyond the minimum industry standards · Must develop proactive strategies
34

#RSAC
Not just HIPAA ­ Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999
· Has a "Privacy Rule" (PR) & "Safeguards Rule" (SR), 15 USC §§ 6801-6809 · PR requires financial institutions to report to customers what info of theirs is collected, what info is shared,
how it is used, how it is protected · SR requires them to designate an individual to safeguard this data, do a risk analysis to insure it is
safeguarded, test the procedures to safeguard the data and change it if necessary · In 2003, the FTC added a breach notification requirement to GLB · Has been used on the State level to support data protection compliance
35

#RSAC
Not just HIPAA ­ Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)
· Created to counter massive corporate fraud such as Enron and others
· Overwhelming Congressional response · SOX § 302 ­ Disclosure provision to stockholders · Criminal provision ­ 18 USC § 1350 · Civil provision ­ 15 USC § 7241 · Loss of Intellectual Property has been interpreted by think
tanks as requiring SOX notification to stockholders · http://www.thetso.com/Info/Executive%20Counsel%20
Article.pdf · Loss of personal info data should also require it
36

#RSAC
Not just HIPAA ­ State breach notification laws

· Slightly outdated diagram · In 2014, Kentucky became 47th · All 4 US territories have one · Darker colors ­ tougher laws · Virginia considered toughest
penalties · California started this with law
effective 2003 · Instituted breach notification · Generally applies to government agencies and businesses · Some States' breach notification laws also cover healthcare
37

State to adopt
because of highest passed in 2002,

#RSAC
GLB's Security Rule applies to higher education institutions
· When they act as "financial institutions"
· E.g., when they keep records of student financial aid
· So claims the National Assn. of University and College Attorneys
· Claims the FTC has so ruled
· Check out their published analysis
· http://www.nacua.org/nacualert/docs /GLB_Note_051603i.html
38

#RSAC
What's ahead?
· Push for national breach notification law
· Earlier this year from the former US Attorney General
· Recently by President Obama in the press release in advance of his State of the Union address
· Spurred on by recent breaches at Target, Neiman Marcus, etc.
· Mandatory EHR/EMR by 2015
· Point is ­ no end in sight to private data going digital with regulations & statutes being created to protect
39

What's ahead ­ Random audits by the Federal #RSAC Financial Institutions Examination Council
· Announced they will perform a HIPAA-style pilot inspection program in 2015
· Will audit 500 community banks
· Audits will focus on these same HIPAA-style issues
· Will include banks with under $10 billion in assets & limited purpose chartered institutions
· Threat intelligence & collaboration
· Cybersecurity controls
· Service provider & vendor risk management
· Cyber-incident management and resilience
· This mirrors PRECISELY what our contacts in the financial industry told us in spring of 2014
40

#RSAC
What's ahead
· EU data protection law undergoing major changes
· Data Protection Directive of 1995 to be amended
· Many concerns
· Obvious one is the Directive's age ­ many tech changes
· Also only advisory Directive
· Individual member states applied Directive differently
41

#RSAC
What's ahead
· EU Data Protection Regulation
· All 28 EU member states MUST adopt this once passed
· Applied not just to entities IN the EU but ANYONE DOING BUSINESS in the EU
· Adopts breach notification for the first time
· Institutes a statutory "Right to be Forgotten"
· 2%-5% global gross revenue penalty for violations
42

#RSAC
What's ahead ­ Court rulings
· Case law is starting to join the fray
· Civil suits use to be routinely dismissed
· Victim had to prove dollar lose reasonably attributed to breach
· Courts are starting to change that
· The potential for financial losses has been recently held as sufficient
· Another court penalized the breached company on the theory of the customer's subscription cost implied there'd be a secure data system
· An EU court found a "Right to be Forgotten" in the current Data Protection Directive
43

How to respond to these pressures/issues?

#RSAC

· Most of these you already know · Multiple areas of risk · Requires layered approach · Policies/processes or procedures · Employees BIG source of vulnerability · Big stick/big carrot ­ applied equally to all · No longer just guarding the gates, but hoarding off the invaders · Limiting location of sensitive data · Limiting ability to view accessed sensitive data (encryption) · Being able to demonstrate all this (reports)

44

Data at risk resides in many places these days #RSAC Many devices, one solution, makes much sense

Some issues may not come to you immediately when #RSAC it comes to mobile device security
· Can you remotely access device, device freeze, data delete · Can remote access be interrupted by thief/unauthorized person · Can remote access be assured ­ Think about Target's breach · Can location of missing/stolen device be remotely tracked · Can missing mobile device be recovered by law enforcement · Must the victim of the loss/theft be the one to recover · Can forensics be performed on recovered device · Can encryption's existence during theft/loss be documented · What about documenting access to sensitive data during
theft/loss · Being able to issue reports on all this
46

Any Questions?
