Best Boost for Efficiency and Effectiveness #RSAC
Detection, analytics, training

Better detection tools (i.e. static and dynamic analysis tools )
Better analysis tools
More training on how to deal with incident response issues More training on how to manage incident response issues across
multiple networks Employ more IT security staff
Automation of processes to free up staff

Inhibitors to Real-time Awareness

#RSAC

Understanding behavior, operational integration, analytics

Need a better understanding of user behaviour
Need tighter integration between security intelligence and IT operations tools (NPM, APM, etc.)
Need a better understanding of network behaviour
Need better tools to baseline normal behaviour so we can detect anomalies
Need a better understanding of server virtualisation technology behaviour
Need better automated analytics from our security intelligence tools

Pursuit of Perfection
The Setup
 Integrated Security Architecture
 Ability detect and provide alerts to potential threats in as they occur
 Adapt and improve security  Complete coverage:
 Endpoint, Network, Identity, and Data
 Mature Incident Response
 Ability to Collect Meaningful Data  Ability to Analyze the Data Quickly  Ability to Act Very Fast ­ Minimize Impact  Ability to Protect the Future

Time is Against You
Attackers Have the Upper Hand
 Attacks take a lot of time to plan.  You don't detect pre attack activities  Attacks are executed quickly  53% of the Time it Takes More

 Use the Tools You Have and Trust
 You Have The Right People
 Only 17% feel they need better analysis/ forensics skills.
 You Have the Data, just not integration
 Only 26% say they have a hard time gathering the right data for accurate situational awareness
 A Whopping 47% say they spend most of their time determining impact. i.e. putting the pieces together

 Integrate
 37% feel they need tighter integration
 Understanding and Visibility

Clarity to Drive Better, Faster Decisions

#RSAC

Current state vs. integrated and agile

CURRENT STATE
Limited scope. Point in time context.

AGILE APPROACH
Continuous monitoring and contextual analytics

Product 1 Product 2
Product 3
Result
Limited, reactive visibility and threat protection

Result
Faster, more proactive awareness of threats and anomalous events

23

Confidence to Act

#RSAC

Boost confidence with risk scoring, automation, watch lists and alerting

 Gain confidence to act:
 Distillation and prioritization  Risk scoring and
customizable tuning  Increased automation  Focus on what matters most

TRIAGE AND
PRIORITIZE
CLARITY FROM
