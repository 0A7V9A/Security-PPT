The Cloud has opportunities that must be seized

Your tools and methods don't work here

There can be a downside

#RSAC
BC Hydro's AMI Deployment
 British Columbia larger than CA, OR and WA combined
 1.9 million Smart Meters, 1000's of Field Area Routers (FAR), IPv6 network
 Deployment: 2011 through 2014  Cost: $$$  Energy Theft Analytics a key part of
business case
4

#RSAC
Energy Theft Analytics
 Energy theft in BC was a large problem estimated at >500 GWh/yr
 Primarily due to marijuana grow ops
 Improved energy diversion detection business case:
 Was estimated to be 45% of the total SMI project benefits
 Electrical safety improvements
 Cloud based system was chosen  Contract was awarded to a US company
5

#RSAC
Across Jurisdictional Boundaries
 Canadian privacy laws control transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) over legal jurisdictional boundaries including to the US
 Freedom Of Information and Protection Of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) forbids transfer of data outside of Canada
 Cloud provider can establish Canadian data center in compliance with FOIPPA requirements
 Cloud provider can administer the operation from the US. Data and algorithms can run in the Canadian cloud and never in the US
6

#RSAC
Requirements
 Working at the intersection Cloud & Big Data
 Volume ­ terabytes  Variety ­ 3 to 20 types  Velocity ­ multiple reads per day
 Gathering data from the Smart Meter fleet millions and sending to the provider for analysis
 Producing actionable power theft lead reporting for the investigators
7

#RSAC
Solution
 Cloud provider provides theft analytics with Software as a Service (SaaS) Black Box
 Uses proprietary and patented processes including algorithms that the cloud provider will not release to client
 Black box providers usually don't allow security assessment or testing within their security perimeter
 Public/Private cloud and Identity Federation to the cloud provider is not necessary for architecture requirements because the relationship is based on data transfer and report production
8

#RSAC
Standards Based Security
 Security Team findings drive product and process changes  Common set of principles that client and the cloud provider can
accept is needed  Architecture, Security Assessment and Testing should be based on
standards and frameworks provided by:
 Cloud Security Alliance e.g. Security Guidance v3.0  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
Publications (SP) e.g. SP800-144, SP800-146
9

#RSAC
Let Risk be the Guide
 Use case created for each test case
 Security assessments used to determine risk rating  Use risk rating to prioritize security resources and efforts
 Risk assessment focus
 Access Control  Encryption  Interfaces and communication channels
10

#RSAC
Security Process
11

#RSAC
Security Vetting
 Security Architecture
 Cloud Security Alliance and NIST considerations for best practices implemented in the architecture
 Focus on connections to the cloud provider and treatment of PII inside the cloud
 Focus on data transfer and storage architecture both for initial upload and ongoing communications
 Security Assessment
 Creates and confirms alignment of policies between client and the cloud provider
12

#RSAC
Security Assessment
 The Security Assessment investigates Administrative and Technical Controls for:
 Data Communications  Data Transfer  Based on client's policies e.g.
 ISO 27000 Series, NIST IR 7628, Cloud Security Alliance
13

#RSAC
Security Testing
 Tests and verifies security implementation is in alignment with the architecture
 Tests for proper use of username, passwords, and key generation in alignment with client's corporate policy
 Tests transfer mechanisms such as SSH for compliance to best practices
 Security tools ­ e.g. Codenomicon, Nessus and AppScan can be used to check infrastructure and application on the client side
 If security testing of cloud service provider's infrastructure is done, must have agreements in place with liabilities determined and accepted
14

#RSAC
Master Service Agreement
 Data at rest and in transit to have strong encryption  Access control based on principle of least privilege with role based
requirements  For Situational Awareness monitoring, logging and reporting by the
cloud provider is required  Configuration Management & Change Control is required  Data destruction to best practices is required  Security Awareness training for cloud provider's staff is required
15

#RSAC
Master Service Agreement
 Physical segmentation from other clients' processing and data storage required
 Data transfer across jurisdictional boundaries must comply with applicable rules e.g. BC FOIPPA
 Innovative business and process solutions are required to monitor and maintain servers but restrict data flow
 Client's right to audit agreed aspects of the cloud provider's security is required
16

#RSAC
Benefits
 Security becomes a business enabler
 Security paranoia is replaced with security innovation  Legal, business and privacy stakeholder needs are met  Best business and technology solution is implemented securely
 Master Service Agreement incorporates security  Auditable processes are implemented for cloud security  Relationship between client and cloud provider is set up for long
term success
17

#RSAC
Apply this when Acquiring a Cloud Service
 Define security, privacy and compliance requirements
 Make them a part of the architecture and the contract
 Identify requirements imposed by jurisdictional boundaries
 Engage privacy, legal and business teams to inform compliance options
 Focus on connections to the cloud provider and treatment of protected information
 Use Security Assessment to confirm alignment of policies and standards between client and the cloud provider
18

#RSAC
Apply this when Acquiring a Cloud Service
 Address the Security Assessment findings and client's right to audit in Master Service Agreement
 Test to verify security implementation is in alignment with the approved architecture ­ e.g. Nessus, Code Review, Test Passwords, SSH Encryption Keys, etc.
 If security testing of cloud service provider's site or infrastructure is to be done, must have agreements in place with liabilities determined and accepted
 The contract with the cloud provider becomes the principal security lever, not the client's security infrastructure
