Why Does the Pilot Analogy Work?

Multidisciplinary

Dependencies on external factors

Risk-based decision making

Adaptability is essential

The (Experimental) Test Pilot Analogy

#RSAC

Works Even Better

 Unique and highly customized operating environments
 Self-governance over change and configuration management
 Greater need to be prepared for emergencies
 Decide our own monitoring capabilities
 We set our own operating parameters
 Self-regulation (within limits)

Decision Criteria

Risk Elements

Pilot
The pilot's fitness to fly must be evaluated, including competency in the aircraft, currency, and flight experience.

Aircraft
The aircraft performance, limitations, equipment, and airworthiness must be determined.

Environment
Factors such as weather and airport conditions must be examined.

#RSAC
External Pressures
The purpose of the flight is a factor that influences the pilot's decision to begin or continue the flight.

Situation
To maintain situational awareness, an accurate perception must be attained of how the pilot, aircraft, environment, and external pressures combine to affect the flight.

The Evolving Role

#RSAC

of Incident Response

(External Pressures)

#RSAC
Incident Response: Operational or Strategic Issue?

 Changes in priorities post-breach  Factors influencing incidents  Differences in C-level perceptions  Business impact of breaches  Regulatory considerations  Potential for ROI  Difficulty in modeling scenarios,
particularly for non-IT breaches

90%

54%

90% of companies are confident
about their security policies, processes,
and procedures

However, 54% have had to manage public
scrutiny following a security breach

7

#RSAC
Criticality of Alignment to Business Goals
 Understand risk tolerance and acceptable outcomes  Understand data lifecycle and provide business context  Stakeholder selection for effective decision making  Follow asset ownership and purchase trends  Integrate processes with partners
 Expectation management  Communication  Internal and external, customer and supplier
8

#RSAC
Changing Perceptions from "If" to "When"

 Statistics are against us
 Prevention is a focus of budget
 Overcoming the "denial effect"
 Increasing times to contain incidents
 Need for "Risk aware" decisions
 Understanding and addressing sources of compromises

Effectiveness of Layered Controls

 Emphasis on prevention (don't want to die!)  39% perform testing to understand the potential attack surface  Less than 50% effectively implement the following processes:

Identity administration or user provisioning

Patching and configuration

Penetration testing

Endpoint forensics

Vulnerability scanning

Dangerous (but common) assumption: Global enterprises and service providers do the basics very well

#RSAC
Breaking the Chain of Risk

 Single cause events are relatively rare
 Incidents require the alignment of contributing factors
 Mandates for layered defenses
 Inability to determine root cause
 Failures can be counted upon
 Remove single points of failure

Missing or Failed Defenses

Organizational Influences

Unsafe Supervision

Latent Failures

Preconditions for Unsafe Acts

#RSAC
Leverage Existing Resources to Plan

Integrate with Layered Defenses
 Consider progressive containment modes
 Tune monitoring thresholds dynamically
 Integrate response plan with `compromise decisions'
19

Use Decision Support Tools Effectively
 Understand how to detect and investigate anomalies
 Use business information to understand the context
 Process integration with security service providers
