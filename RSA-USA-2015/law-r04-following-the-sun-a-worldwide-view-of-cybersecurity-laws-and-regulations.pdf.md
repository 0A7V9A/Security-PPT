Overall Key Challenges & Highlights
 You can't develop a ground up set of controls for each country, so how to define the 80 ­ 20 requirements that will drive your base standards?
 There are finite company legal and compliance resources. How do you make the best use of those resources?
 Internal resources  Outside counsel  Information service
 Regulations are dynamic. How do you keep your advice current? Follow changes? How do you identify countries most apt to change?
