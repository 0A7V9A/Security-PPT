Physical World Conclusions
· Aviation is a visible, vulnerable and attractive target.
· The enemy is resilient and adaptive. · Today's attack vectors may not be tomorrow's
attack vectors. · Attacks can be sophisticated and coordinated or
they can be lone wolf efforts. · Attackers many not fit the `traditional' picture.

Lessons For Other Industries
 Cyber attacks have downstream effects.  Focus is on:
 Harming People  Dramatic visual property damage.
 Secondary effects are likely to be emotional and economic.

#RSAC
Cyber Security Implications
 Networks are good means to achieve desired ends.
 Critical cyber vulnerabilities are:
 Access Control  Control of Potential Kinetic Weapons (IOT)
 Need to secure unintended use and corruption of technology
 Driverless Cars  Conveyer Systems

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Next week you should:
 Identify critical ecosystems that serve your organization
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Understand the cyber vulnerabilities of these ecosystems  Define appropriate measures to reduce/mitigate these
vulnerabilities
 Within six months you should:
 Develop and implement policies and contractual modifications for the identified ecosystems to hold ancillary vendors to higher, stated security standards..

#RSAC
Key Takeaways
 Tomorrow's threats will not be like today's.  Don't underestimate your enemies.  Think like an attacker, not a defender.  Hold your suppliers and partners accountable to the same
or a greater level of security than you have.  Consider the psychological impact as well as actual
damage.
