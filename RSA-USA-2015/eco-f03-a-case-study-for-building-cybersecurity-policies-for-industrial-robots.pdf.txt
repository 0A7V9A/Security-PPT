#RSAC

About OT Security

 A new reality for industrial enterprises  Data capture from OT (Operational Technology) environments  Operational and SCADA visibility  Predictive analytics  Continual process optimization

2

#RSAC
Why It Matters
 A competitive advantage:
 Intelligent capture,  Aggregation,  Inspection, and  Analysis
 It's necessary for survival
3

#RSAC
Why It's Hard
 Security  Security  Security

#RSAC
What's Hard About OT Security
 It's less about CIA  It's more about Availability, Uptime and Safety  You can't just shut down or update machines to remediate security
problems
5

#RSAC
OT Security Is Fundamentally Different
 A holistic approach is needed  Point solutions are not the answer  Visibility (thru authentication and authorization) plus content
inspection  Holistic policy frameworks  Manageability at scale  Pervasive enforcement
6

#RSAC
A Broader View for Enterprise IT
 Computers, apps and networks are managed by IT  Arrgh! Who will help me figure this out?
 As assets within Information Security, computers, apps and networks are managed by IT
 As assets within an Operations Center, their productivity efficiencies and use, computers, apps and networks are managed by IT
 How are they to be reconciled/converged?

#RSAC
Toward a Solution
 IT and OT people need to be deeply conscious of security
8

#RSAC
Experience and Learnings
 We'll present an extended example  Discrete manufacturing  The general problems are broadly
applicable
9

#RSAC
The Business Driver
 Predictive analytics  A classic Industrial Internet application:
 Cuts production downtime  Provides secure remote access  Cuts maintenance costs
10

#RSAC
Here's the Architecture
11

#RSAC
The Technical Objective
 Transmit fine-grained SCADA telemetry to a cloud-based application
 Permit intermittent access by remote access service personnel
12

#RSAC
The Security Problems
 Requires a new integration between IT and OT networks
13

#RSAC
Industrial Networking Is Different
 Transmit identity and contextual-based access controls  Enforcing who, what, where and their role  Enforce content-based policy constraints
14

#RSAC
The Security Risks
 Bad things can happen, particularly if PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) or control loops or machines are written to.
15

Here's the Solution Architecture
Fine- grained, contextually aware access control functions. Tags

16

#RSAC

#RSAC
Why It Works
 Unsafe transactions are blocked and machine access is restricted to specific user roles
17

#RSAC
Holistic Policy
 Many policy frameworks are possible, but you just need one.
18

#RSAC
How It Helps IT People
 Holistic management  Solves the scale problem  New, OT-aware security products fill the knowledge gap
19

#RSAC
How It Helps OT People
 Addresses the business driver.  Presents minimal risk to availability and uptime.  The ideal solution bridges IT and OT.
20

#RSAC
How You Can Use This
 The basic technique in OT security is to maintain the aspects of closed system while permitting communications.
 This means that identity-based security and encryption are inadequate, because identity-based controls are inadequate.
 Network-based controls are challenging in the OT space.  Content-based controls are required to prevent unsafe operations.
 All three are needed for a holistic solution.
21

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Next week you should:  Schedule an IT/OT planning meeting to get ahead of your organization's industrial IoT security questions.
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:  Identify the roles of IT and OT with regards to your organization's cybersecurity strategy.
 Within six months you should:  Select a cybersecurity solution which allows proactive operational, security and safety policy to be set according to your organization's needs  Drive an implementation project to protect your industrial infrastructure.
