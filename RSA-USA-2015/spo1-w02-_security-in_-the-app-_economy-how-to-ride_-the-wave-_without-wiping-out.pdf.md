#RSAC

Are you rolling out new apps & services to your customers?

Are you using security to improve customer engagement?

Are you leveraging security to enable and drive business?

Have you had a breach in the last year -as far as you know?

Today, Every Company is a Software Company. #RSAC Are You?
In 2014, CEOs must focus on leading their organizations to think like and become more like "tech" companies, because within a few years, digital business capabilities will dominate every industry. Urgent action is needed because first-mover advantage is common in digital business, and fast followers must be very fast.

From sneaker company to data enabled athletic brand.

Lessons in Mobility
 Begin with the user experience as the focus. Is login required?  Review and define your architecture holistically; be prepared to move fast!  Choose the app type that fits your use case and objective and implement a
solution that combines usability and security (native app SSO + web)  Leverage your existing SSO implementation to improve the experience  Engage the business now around what SaaS projects are coming up and
position the enterprise friendly vendors...say "yes" to BYOA  Start thinking beyond front door access for SaaS

#RSAC
Lessons in protecting your business
 Perimeter security is necessary, but not sufficient. You need to think end-toend and defend from the inside-out
 Think about your identities. Do your accounts have the right privileges? Who certified access? Do you have orphaned accounts?
 Nearly all of the most damaging attacks use a privileged identity ­ focus your attention here!
 Don't think of insider threats as purely malicious employees: they can be targeted with social engineering or can be careless
 Additional security doesn't have to make the user experience more difficult. Risk-awareness is essential - security gets applies only where needed
