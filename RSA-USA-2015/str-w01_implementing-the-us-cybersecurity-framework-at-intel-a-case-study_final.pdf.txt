Framework Pilot

#RSAC
Laying the Groundwork
 Several methods to build comprehensive risk picture tried in the past, but none were satisfactory
 Intel actively involved with NIST and CSF from beginning (February 2013) and ready to pilot at release
 Team engaged and educated senior management at very beginning  Also engaged other stakeholders early; their buy-in helped with
resourcing  Interestingly, the Framework itself facilitated the discussions
12

#RSAC
Pilot Scope (or, Eating the Elephant)
 Intel is a large multi-national enterprise with many business units and 300k+ computing platforms-- and,
 The Framework has ~140 potential assessment points Just designing a pilot to cover all that could take months
So--
Decision made up front to pilot on a subset of well-defined areas
 Not expecting entire risk management plan from just a pilot  Simplified pilot assessment allows us to focus on CSF usage, not
implementation details
13

Pilot Scoping ­ Subset of the Company

 IT models support across company as DOMES-- Design, Office, Manf., Enterprise, Services
 Pilot w/ Office + Enterprise  IT-owned  Highest familiarity with Core Team

Pilot Scoping ­ Only the Top Level of the CSF
 Assessing subcategories too large a task for a pilot
 Decided to only assess to Category level (21+1)
 Our training covered how to assess to higher level
15

Framework Utilization Process
· Tailor Tiers definitions · F2F Session with Core Group to set Targets (Category level) Set Targets · Validate Initial Targets with Decision Makers (CISO & Staff)

· Identify and train SME assessors
· SMEs use custom tools to self score (~1 hour) Assess · Follow-up meeting to validate SME aggregation
Current State

Analyze Results

· Combine individual SME scores with Core Team and compare to Targets · Use simple heat map to identify gaps · Drill down on subcategories for identified gaps to identify key issues

· Meet with CISO & Staff to discuss findings, ratify targets & recommendations

· Ensure prioritization feed into budget and planning cycles

Communicate Results

· Brief Senior Leadership on findings and resulting recommendations

Summary

#RSAC
Our Key Learnings
 The CSF fosters essential internal discussions about alignment, risk tolerance, control maturity, and other elements of cyber risk management  Setting our own Tier Targets was especially useful
 The CSF provides a common language for cross-organizational communications, allowing apple-to-apples comparisons
 Engage all stakeholders early; the Framework itself facilitates discussion  Its alignment to industry practices made it easy to scale and tailor it to our
environment with surprisingly minimal impact
22

#RSAC
Challenges
 Since this is a new tool, both management and pilot participants needed extra discussion up front to become comfortable with it
 For ease of use, we chose to tailor the Tiers definitions to match our own business and risk management language
 Subcategories provided almost overwhelming level of detail  Straightforward roll-up and visualization still a big puzzle

Goal: Pilot using CSF to assess and characterize our Insider Risk

#RSAC
Apply: Utilizing the CSF in Your Organization
You will miss the benefits if you treat the Framework as a compliance exercise, or use an outside agency do it for you
 Coaching is fine but you need to make the journey yourself
First: Inform senior management on the Framework and benefits:
 Driven by and follows industry best practices  Provides common a cybersecurity reference up and down the organization  Drives important conversations on your risks and your tolerance  Can lead to a much better understanding of your complete risk picture
25

#RSAC
Apply: Utilizing the CSF in Your Organization, cont'd
Next, engage and inform all your stakeholders
 Managers & SMEs in InfoSec, IT, GRC, Supply Chain, Finance...  Cast a wide net; eventually many will have inputs  Connect with partners & fellow travelers in your industry
With the stakeholders, design your pilot
 Start where you are comfortable  Use a logical subset of your cybersecurity domain
Execute the pilot
 Maintain constant contact with senior management and stakeholders  Start with the Tiers & Targets discussions, not mapping the categories  Share your results!
