A word on voice phishing
u Spam evolves when under pressure u North America: in last 2-3 years, increasing defence against SMS phishing
has lead to re-emergence of mainstream voice phishing attacks
u Normally (but not always) targeting main banks
u Cost associated (slower, longer, more technical)
u In pressure of aggressive take downs on mobile originated side, makes sense u Additional benefits: can easily spoof bank/credit union's caller ID
u As text protection gets better, this may increase

Conclusion
u Overall volumes from these spammers are dropping
u Due to faster/quicker detection techniques u However as other types of text attacks have dropped even more ­ seems to be
more `noticeable'
u Complexity increasing:
u Average word size decreasing, sending patterns changing
u Determined group will always remain present while favourable economics in place:
u Cost to defeat defences << number of victims * amount stolen from victim
u However the group, must be seen in context of overall bank phishing industry

#RSAC
Apply Slide
u If you're just an average phone user u Ignore the messages ­ a bank will never contact you like this u Report them to banks and carriers
u If you represent a carrier u These messages can and should be blocked to protect your customers u Other brands/companies are also affected - put protection in place
u If you represent a bank u Monitor/get intelligence so you know if an attack happens u Raise alerts and spread the word to your customers when it does
