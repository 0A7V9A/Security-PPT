Let's Stay Together, Baby

#RSAC

 The quality of a relationship is a function of the extent to which it is built on a solid underlying friendship and meets the needs of the two people involved.
 If you put your relationship in a win/lose situation, it will be a lose/lose situation.
 Make a promise to work on your marriage every single day -- not just during the bad times, but also during the good ones.
