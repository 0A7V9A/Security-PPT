Examples of

misinformation...

#RSAC
Web application scan results
"Hundreds of critical and high risk vulnerabilities"

Common ways

#RSAC

misinformation occurs - and

how to avoid them

#RSAC
How many of you work in organizations that use a "risk register"? How is it being used?
10

#RSAC
Measuring the wrong thing
u Which of the following are "risks"
u Failure to change smoke detector batteries u Smoke detector fails u Building catches on fire
Likelihood: "Moderate" Impact: "Severe"
11

#RSAC
Measuring the wrong thing
u Which of the following are "risks"
u Failure to change smoke detector batteries u Smoke detector fails u Building catches on fire
Control deficiencies are not "risks" You can't directly assign an impact estimate to a control deficiency
12

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u If you're measuring things as "risk" that aren't risk, then your measurements are almost certain to be inaccurate and misleading.
u Make sure you're measuring loss events, because they're the only thing you can apply a likelihood AND impact estimate to.
13

#RSAC
Misaligned measurements
u Common mistake:
u Estimating most common occurrence for likelihood, then worst-case for impact u Almost always overstates the level of risk
14

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Always estimate impact first
u Worst-case? Most common outcome?
u Rate likelihood second u Because it forces you to clarify the event you're evaluating and
helps avoid misalignment between impact and likelihood ratings
15

#RSAC
Broken measurement scales
u Three most common problems
u Ambiguity u Lack of alignment with business reality u Compression
16

#RSAC
Which of these is worse?
u Unfavorable comments from media, minor impact to staff, no criminal implications, impact to customer service, minor legal action.
u Critical article in the media, some affect on staff, attempted (unsuccessful or minor breach) of system, significant number of customers encounter minor inconveniences, individual lawsuit expected.
17

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Make certain the descriptions for each level of your scale are clearly distinguished.
u Leverage numeric values whenever possible, for example:
u Likelihood percentages (e.g., > 50% likelihood in the next year) u Lost revenue, number of affected customers, duration of downtime, etc.
u Consider using fewer levels in your scale.
u Particularly if you're using qualitative descriptions
18

#RSAC
Alignment with business reality
u Where would you draw the line for "High" financial impact (the highest level in the scale) for a "Too big to fail" financial institution?
u $500,000 u $2,000,000 u $10,000,000 u $50,000,000
Is that truly "high" impact for an organization that large?
19

#RSAC
Compression in impact ratings
u Where would you draw the line for "High" financial impact (the highest level in the scale) for a "Too big to fail" financial institution?
u $500,000 u $2,000,000 u $10,000,000 u $50,000,000
$100,000,000 impact would receive the same impact rating. Unable to distinguish at the high end of the scale.
20

#RSAC
Likelihood compression
u Where would you draw the line for "Low" likelihood?
u Once every two years or more u Once every ten years or more u Once every fifty years or more
A 100-year flood would receive the same likelihood rating. Unable to distinguish at the low end of the scale.
21

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Work with business stakeholders to ensure scales are aligned with the business
u Make "Compression" an explicit part of the conversation
22

#RSAC
Poor measurements/estimates
23

#RSAC
News flash!
Humans stink at estimating But they can improve dramatically with training
24

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Get calibrated! Which is:
u A process for gauging and improving a person's ability to make accurate estimates
u Supports better critical thinking
u Resources
u How to Measure Anything (by Douglas Hubbard) u www.lesswrong.com u www.predictionbook.com
25

#RSAC
Inaccurate models
26

#RSAC
Models matter

Meaningful  Measurements Accurate  Models
27

#RSAC
Common mistakes in infosec models
u Leaving out likelihood of an attack u Accounting for controls in the wrong part of the equation u Questionable math
28

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Adopt an established and well-vetted public model (e.g., FAIR)
u Resources
u The Open Group
u http://www.opengroup.org/standards/security u https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13G u https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13K
29

#RSAC
Poor analysis scoping
30

#RSAC
The scope definition problem
u What's wrong with these scenarios?
u Compromise of customer information u Database breach u Employee commits fraud using customer information The last two are each subsets of the first one!
31

#RSAC
The scope drift problem
u You start out measuring one thing, but end up measuring something else. For example:
u Intended scope: u The risk associated with inappropriate access privileges
u What you actually analyzed: u The risk associated with inappropriate insider actions
32

#RSAC
Avoiding these problems
u Make scoping an explicit part of the analysis process
u Recognize when there's the potential for double counting/overlap
u When an analysis has been completed, review it to ensure the scope didn't "drift"
u What you measured = what you intended to measure?
33

#RSAC
Blind acceptance of tool-generated risk ratings
u Scanning and other security technology tools rarely get risk right
u Leave out key risk elements (e.g., likelihood of an event) u Superficially considered factor weights u Lots of ordinal math
34

#RSAC
Avoiding this problem
u Understand the weaknesses in how your tools rate risk u Apply that understanding and some critical thinking to understand
how to adjust/interpret their output
35

#RSAC
The benefits of change

#RSAC
The benefits of change
u Obviously:
u Improved signal-to-noise ratio u Better able to prioritize/focus effectively
u Fewer opportunities for gaps to occur u Reduce wasted resources
u Less obvious:
u Better credibility and influence with business executives
37

#RSAC
Applying what we've covered

#RSAC
Apply Slide
u Next week you should:
u Stop the bleeding -- apply more critical thinking to risk ratings u Begin pushing back on risk ratings -- ask for explanations that stand up u Begin recognizing which common problems occur where you work
u In the first three months following this presentation you should:
u Get calibrated! Read Douglas Hubbard's book u Review and clean up your risk register u Refine/fix your measurement scales
39

#RSAC
Apply Slide - continued
u Within six months you should:
u Fix your models - consider adopting FAIR u Improve your ability to scope analyses
