Key Themes of the 2015 Study
 Security Concerns Continue to Escalate  Application Vulnerability Concerns Unmatched by Remediation

 Sprawl in Security Technologies is a Material Concern  Growing importance of managed or outsourced security
services  Cloud adoption is no longer a question of if, but how much.
