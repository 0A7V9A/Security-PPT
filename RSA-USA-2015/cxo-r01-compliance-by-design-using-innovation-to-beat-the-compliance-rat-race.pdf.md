Why privacy + security matters
"At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a valuable asset and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset."
Alex Grove, 2000, Former CEO of Intel Corporation

#RSAC
Data ecosystem
 Data Complexity
 More data = more noise
 Data Emergence
 The calculus of privacy & data sovereignty
 Data self-organisation
 Datasets interact with one-another, modifying the data ecosystem, producing more knowledge ­ for example...

#RSAC
Legal, industry & consumer response framework
 Complex: privacy and data-related law reform at a global level.
 Multi-layered regulatory frame work:
 Informational privacy + data protection (e.g., Privacy Act (Aus), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act or "PIPEDA" (Canada), EU Data Directive, etc)
 Data breach notification (e.g., California S.B. 1386 or proposed Aust laws)  Anti- spam (e.g., Spam Act 2003 (Aust), CASL (Canada), CAN SPAM (US)
etc)  Industry regulation & standards (PCI DSS, KMIP, PKCS, etc)

#RSAC
Data is a hard beast to tame
 Data is BIG and it flows seamlessly.  Data collection, use, disclosure is regulated & creates risk.  Cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) make it hard to control.  We want the benefits but not the risk and loss of control.  How do we resolve this?

#RSAC
Maybe we're asking the wrong questions?
 The answer  "just encrypt it".  The issue is not use X algorithm or use ABC vendor.  The issue not (necessarily) just all about data (or at least
encrypted data).  Instead, we need to turn the debate to key management, visibility
and interoperability.

#RSAC
Data sovereignty
 Once data leaves a jurisdiction's borders, other laws apply (and not always the good type) + loss of physical control.
 Data sovereignty is not solely a privacy issue
 Business sensitive information  Confidential information  Ownership

#RSAC
Data sovereignty & cross border disclosures in Australia
 Cross border disclosure of personal information (Privacy Act, APP 8):
Before an APP entity discloses personal information about an individual to an overseas recipient, the entity must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles
 A focus on ongoing accountability (Privacy Act, Section 16C):
Acts of overseas recipients of personal information (in summary) Where: a) An Australian entity discloses personal information about an individual to an overseas
recipient; and b) The overseas recipient breaches the Australian Privacy Principles; then that act is taken to have been done by the Australian disclosing entity.

Case study: Apple's solution to data

#RSAC

sovereignty & privacy

 Consider the risk environment:
 Broad government data access laws via Patriot Act brought starkly to light by the Snowden leaks
 Consumer concerns around personal privacy (e.g., Government access (Snowden) and also malicious access (e.g., Celebrity iCloud leaks))
 Business value (probably the real reason):
 Money, money, money  Apple seeking to create an environment where financial transactions can be conducted
via biometric finger scanner  Laws requiring authentication for financial transactions
 The solution - engineering control
 Not (effectively) holding the data (despite actually holding it via Apple's cloud infrastructure)
 Encryption keys wrapped in user device & linked to biometric finger print scanner

#RSAC
Marketing and big data ­ the legal challenge
 The drive to communicate with customers is key to business.
 Organisations operating in multiple jurisdictions, with geographically dispersed retail outlets, the compliance problem is massive.
 Compliance requirements vary between:  Communication medium (e.g., Email, SMTP messages, SMPP messages, telephone calls)  Jurisdiction (CASL for Canada, CAN SPAM and Telephone Consumer Protection Act of USA, Spam Act and Do Not Call Register Act for Aus)
 A compliance strategy is discussed later.

#RSAC
How does one decide?
 Popularity test - follow the crowd  Fashion test ­ pick your favourite vendor and follow them  Simplicity test ­ weigh the standards  Complexity test ­ run tools over the standards document  Taste test - read the standards

The natural evolution of standards

Fear + consumer demand

Competitors organise a competing industry standard

Standard sinks or swims

Drives law reform

Clear winners emerge

Standardisation drives competition

Industry responds with new "solutions"

New solutions complex, expensive
+proprietary

Competition drives consolidation + consumer benefit

Interoperability in "Compliance by Design"
 Interoperability:
 Creates competition  Helps prevent vendor-lock in  Mitigates business continuity risk
 Interoperability standards:
 Make acquisition and use of ICT products streamlined  Transparency ­ for improved governance and audit  Consistent semantics enable analytics

#RSAC
Interoperability reduces complexity

 Interoperability in ICT procurement:
 Mandatory requirement  Measurable targets
 Consider:
 Interoperability warranties at procurement  Interoperability in transition-out  Warranties covering standards compliance  False standards ­ beware!

Stakeholder requirements

Data breach & notification

 Key questions (by reference to California S.B. 1386):
 Does data include "personal information?  Does "personal information" relate to a California resident?  Was the "personal information" unencrypted?

Apply what you have learned today
 Next week you should:
 Identify opportunities for applying compliance by design  Ask your vendor if they support enterprise key management  Ask your vendor if they support interoperability in cloud environments
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Define a project to evaluate compliance by design
 Within six months you should:
 Drive an implementation to evaluate compliance by design

Thank You!
