And finally, we get to threats
 A botnet (Conficker) infected millions of new PCs for 3 years after it was `suppressed'. - According to Computerworld's Gregg
Keizer,(April 26, 2012)
 The New York Times and The Washington Post have been victims of cyber-intrusions. - According to Washington Post's Craig Timberg and
Ellen Nakashima (February 20, 2013)
 Millions of Target customers were impacted by the Target data breach. - According to
Washington Post's Jia Lynn Yang and Amrita Jayakumar (January 10, 2014)

#RSAC
Applying threats to Oil and Gas Industry
 US National Counterintelligence Executive Report ­ October 2011  "The pace of foreign economic collection and industrial espionage activities against major US corporations and US Government agencies is accelerating."  Energy and natural resources companies are among those likely to be "priority targets"
 Documented attacks / threats  Targeted attacks (Advanced Persistent Threats)  Hacktivist (like Anonymous) activities
 "Game changers"  Shamoon  Stuxnet
 Threat actors (external and internal)

Where we are going...
 Run quantitative risk analysis on each control
 Identify those with most impact (most reduction in risk for less cost)
 Prioritize higher those projects to implement those controls
