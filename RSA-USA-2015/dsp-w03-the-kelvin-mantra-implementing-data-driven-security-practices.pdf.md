Management Program

#RSAC
So you want to measure risk...
 Understand who the threat actors are, and  What threat actions they are likely to perform.  Have a good handle on your control strength, and  Know what controls are protecting critical assets.  Have some idea of the impact of an incident or breach,  as well as incidents you've already had.

Threat Actors/Actions ­ Events
 Your own incidents (phishing, virus hits, near misses) - simple counting! Don't hide!
 Your own breaches (disclosed or otherwise) - simple counting!  Security industry sources (I'm kinda partial to the DBIR) - simple
counting  Vertical industry peers (back to the ISACs again) - simple counting!

 Challenges:
 Lacked comparative data against industry peers  Need tools to communicate performance to management  Limited visibility into the supply chain partners
 Results
 Weekly reports to executive management  Prioritization of internal initiatives
 Requiring additional penetration testing and cyber insurance coverage of vendors
