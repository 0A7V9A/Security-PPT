A Secure Secret Sharing Scheme
Suppose we have a secret s An n-out-of-n secret sharing scheme:
Pick n-1 random values s1, s2, ..... , sn-1 and set sn = s1 s2 ......... sn Now, if we store each si on a different server, then even if an adversary learns any n-1 of the si values, he (provably) learns nothing about s This can be generalized to k-out-of-n secret sharing scheme such that even if an adv learns k of the si values, he learns nothing about s; Advantage is that s can be reconstructed using any k+1 out of the si values (better reliability)
