Implications of Sophisticated Attack Tools #RSAC and the lack of Sophistication to use them
 Imbalance exists with the Return On Investment (ROI) proposition for cyber-criminals vs. organisations
 Organisations spend large amounts on security infrastructure and threat intelligence (% of their overall budget) on trying to equalise the equation
 Regardless of these investments by numerous companies, there have still been breakdowns in security controls:
 JP Morgan Chase  Sony Pictures Entertainment  Home Depot  Anthem

Dealing with the

Threat Landscape @ ANZ

#RSAC

#RSAC
Back to ANZ Bank
 Operate across 33 markets and have 28 regulators to appease
 Tightest Regulator we deal with: Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
 Impose tight limits on banks reporting security incidents  Definition of security incidents becomes interesting  Timelines to report these incidents extends to hours with root cause having to be identified within days
 Banking Operations within:  China  Hong Kong  Taiwan
12

#RSAC
What does this mean to ANZ ?
 Operate in a challenging environment  Geographically positioned in some
interesting places across the world  Consequently, our environment is large and
prone to be subjected to various levels of badness from various sorts of actors
13

#RSAC
What does this mean to ANZ ? (cont.)
 Operate within the confines of various regulations and regulators
 Some have preconceived ideas, outdated security models and theories
 Signature-based detection does not always work
 We observe threats before signatures are available to detect them
 Threats are polymorphic and obscured so straightforward detection doesn't work
14

#RSAC
Problems faced by ANZ and others

 We have a number of security tools and products
 Each of these tools provide a high level of intelligence output  Issues we initially faced
 Data is present within the environment  Data flows everywhere and is often duplicated  Transmitted without any context  Not being used effectively

 We need to respond quickly to threat intelligence
 Both internally and externally
 It needs to be actionable intelligence that we can use in our environment

Dealing with the

Threat Landscape Globally

#RSAC

#RSAC
Problems faced more globally
 Return On Investment (ROI) for cyber-criminals is high  Return On Investment (ROI) for organisations is low  Organisations have to invest a considerable
amount to defend themselves (and in some cases that still isn't enough)  To balance the equation
 Need to work more closely with one another
 Share data and information with context within trust groups to further defend against these threats
18

#RSAC
Problems faced more globally (cont.)
 We need to work as a community  Reverse the ROI equation
 Make it harder for cyber-criminals to attack organisations
 Tip the balance in our favour
 Adopt Knowledge Hierarchy
 Companies have data  Valuable when pooled together
with others' data  Data becomes information
19

Addressing Threat

Landscape Issues @ ANZ

#RSAC

#RSAC
ANZ's approach to the problem
 Establishment of a Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository
 We use Soltra's Edge platform for this repository (but there are others available)
 Expression of Cyber-Threat Intelligence in STIX notation
 Enforces a common standard for the representation of cyber-threats  Use of known definitions and relationships allows consumers of the
information to understand the meaning and intent of that being expressed
21

#RSAC
ANZ's approach to the problem (cont.)
 Establishment of a Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository
 Assists with providing information and knowledge  Most importantly it provides `context' to our Security Operations Centre
 Integration of Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository
 Global Threat Intelligence & Advanced Response Group  Security Operations Centre
 Streamline flow of information from tools within the environment

Threat Landscape

`Power of the Community'

#RSAC

#RSAC
Harnessing the power of the community
 Being in Australia, we do not see all attacks evolve during our business hours (they normally occur after hours)
 The power of "Community" allows us to gain visibility into:
 Threat indicators  Observables & Indicators
 Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository allows rules for our other security controls to be built automatically
 Provides context and access to time sensitive data fast
27

#RSAC
Benefits of adopting this approach
 Sharing of attack information
 ANZ saw attack information on threats like HeartBleed / Shellshock in 2014  Information collected was a subset of the overall knowledge base  Sharing this attack information assisted those that had not been attacked by those particular hosts  Those participating in the exchange would get additional information about other hostile hosts that could be used as a basis for filters within their environment
28

#RSAC
Benefits of adopting this approach (cont.)
 Sharing of attack information (cont.)
 Other examples include Dyre malware information  Malware targeting financial institution  Sharing of Dyre proxies  Sharing technical information makes it possible to limit the effectiveness of this malware and realign ROI indicators back into our favour
 Sharing provides a deeper pool of data
 Data can be mined to develop signatures based on event-based information that you have received
29

#RSAC
Limitations of this approach
 Solution is not a panacea, it does not stop bad things from happening
 Issues exist around processing information received:
 Block vs. Alert  ANZ monitors and alerts on intelligence it receives
 Does not resolve problems relating to:
 Confidence of data and the association of information  Context of the data  Threat Model
30

#RSAC
Limitations of this approach (cont.)
 How is the data being used
 Producer vs. Consumer of the information
 Integration issues
 Most vendors do not support data interchange formats such as STIX
 Custom development required for translations of data  CSV to STIX  JSON to STIX  XML to STIX
31

Applying Cyber-Threat

Intelligence within your

Organisation

#RSAC

#RSAC
What needs to change ... you can help
 Share information about what you are seeing in your environments
 By sharing observations/indicators:
 You will be helping others defend  In turn they will publish what they are seeing
 Encourage security tool vendors to consider STIX as a valid means of sharing data with the community
 Some have started but more a needed to join in so that the data can be used properly and shared accordingly
33

#RSAC
What needs to change ... you can help (cont.)
 Data / Information needs to be shared in a format that we can ingest into Threat Intelligence Platforms
 Working together we can actually lift the barrier that exists to protect ourselves from Cyber-Warfare
 As a security collective we can re-balance the ROI equation in our favour and in turn make the investment proposition too expensive for them to operate
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE AN IMPACT!!
34

#RSAC
Parting Thoughts ...
"If we all work together we can actually make a difference and result in making it to expensive for the various adversaries to perform Cyber-Warfare."
35

#RSAC
Parting Thoughts ... Let's Apply
 Next week you should:
 Explore a Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository
 In the next three months you should:
 Consider what security data your organisation collects  Understand how this data can be used to defend your sector  Come up with a standard/guidelines on what you can share
 Within six months you should:
 Look at standing up a production Cyber-Threat Intelligence Repository  Integrate some of your production data into it  Set up peering relationships with others in your sector
