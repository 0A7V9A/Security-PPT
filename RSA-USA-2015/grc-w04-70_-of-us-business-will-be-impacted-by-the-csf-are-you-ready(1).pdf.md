Compliance standards have historically

#RSAC

defined risk thresholds for organizations

 Why the Cybersecurity Framework was needed  What is the Cybersecurity Framework  Why you should care about the Cybersecurity Framework  Preparing for using the Cybersecurity Framework

More breaches every day despite increased

#RSAC

compliance requirements and billions in spending

 $46 billion in Cybersecurity spending in 2013
 Cybersecurity spending increased by 10% in 2013
 $3.5M average cost of data breach ­ Up 15%

Communicating cybersecurity risk enables

#RSAC

appropriate spending

7

Executive Order 13636 asked for the creation of a #RSAC Cybersecurity Framework applicable to all sectors
 Executive Order Requirements  Be flexible  Be non-prescriptive  Leverage existing approaches, standards, practices  Be globally applicable  Focus on risk management vs. rote compliance
 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  Referred to as "The Framework"  Issued by NIST on February 12, 2014.

The Framework was developed in partnership #RSAC among industry, academia and government

The Framework establishes three primary

#RSAC

components

Framework Core

Implementation Tiers

Framework Profiles

10

The Framework Core establishes a common

#RSAC

language for describing a cybersecurity program

· A set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and applicable references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors.

Framework Core

· Consists of 5 Functions - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. These provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk.

· Categories and Subcategories for each Function, matched with example Informative References such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.

11

#RSAC
The subcategories describe expected outcomes
Framework Core
12

Organizations select an Implementation Tier #RSAC based on their risk threshold
· Three attributes of Tiers:
- Risk Management Process - Integrated Risk Management
Program - External Participation
Tier 4 may not always be the goal
13

Current and Target state profiles help organizations #RSAC capture their cybersecurity program
14

The Framework establishes a common

#RSAC

language for cybersecurity

15

Communications can occur at all levels within #RSAC an organization using the Framework
16

The Framework identifies seven steps for

#RSAC

developing/improving a cybersecurity program

 Step 1: Prioritize and Scope  Step 2: Orient  Step 3: Create a Current Profile  Step 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment  Step 5: Create a Target Profile  Step 6: Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps  Step 7: Implement Action Plan (Build a Roadmap)

17

Organizations identify their business and

#RSAC

mission objectives to initiate the process

18

The orient step aligns the business goals, assets, #RSAC and regulatory requirements for the program
Risk Thresholds
People
19

Next organization assess their current and

#RSAC

target cybersecurity programs to identify gaps

20

The final step is to implement and monitor an #RSAC action plan to close identified gaps
21

Using the Framework improves

#RSAC

communications and eases compliance

22

Regulators are using the Framework to

#RSAC

increase efficiencies and decrease redundancy

 The Framework has been mapped to industry leading regulations
 HIPAA  PCI  CIP 5  etc
 Organization not voluntarily aligning to the Framework may see increased burden demonstrating compliance

23

There are several resources available to help #RSAC you use the Framework
 Government Programs
 Department of Homeland Security's C3 Voluntary Program
 NIST Industry Resources
 Internet Resource Centers
 Cybersecurity Framework (CForum)
24

Apply: 70%+ of organizations can benefit from #RSAC using the Framework
 Next week you should:
 Prioritize and scope your organizations cybersecurity program
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Initiate a pilot implementation of the cybersecurity Framework  Understand areas of improvement within your organization
 Within six months you should:
 Begin addressing the roadmap items  Expand on the pilot program throughout your organization
