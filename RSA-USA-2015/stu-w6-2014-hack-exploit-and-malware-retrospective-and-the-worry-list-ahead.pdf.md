So what changed?
 Interesting shift in deployment tactics  The Old Days:
 E-mail with malware directly attached (.exe/.zip)
 The Last Few Years:
 Opportunistic infection via legitimate, but infected websites  Links to exploit pack pages
 The Last Few Months?
 ... I'll come to that in a moment

#RSAC
Changes
 Mass use of document based malware
 Macros!  Just open this .exe ­ seriously, it is legit!
 Shift from the basic <div> or <iframe> trick to PHP insertion (e.g.)  Higher quality simple scams

IoT Devices
 Ripped a tonne apart  Many lack the basic mitigations we expected in Windows XP SP2!  It's like AlephOne: Smashing the stack all over again  Many have simple flaws ­ command injection!?
 Everyone says panic about IoT, but despite the flaws little has happened. Attacks don't seem to care...
43

#RSAC
Conclusions & Apply
 Seriously, operational processes beyond Windows!  It isn't all about big sexy headlines  Simple attacks work really well still in 2015 and attackers know it  Exploits are becoming more rare and `high value'  Carefully challenge hype, don't buy in to `scared cows'
 Users take a long time to pick up when we change advice  8 character passwords, scams containing spelling errors... etc.  Focus on SE/Awareness now before it augments further
