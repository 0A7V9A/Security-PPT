Ninja Mind Trick #2 - Consciously Cultivate

#RSAC

Credibility and Relationships

 Key Strategy Concepts
 Meet with your CEO when you don't need to...  Regular meetings without "asks"  Clarification for Audit Committee or Board of Directors  Build up a Surplus of Credibility, then ask for $$$'s
 Potential Success Patterns
 Providing clarity on risk issues CEOs rarely understand  Providing voice of sanity on compliance matters  Pushing back on overzealous 3rd parties

#RSAC
Ninja Mind Trick #3 ­ Shine at the Board of Directors Meeting
 Key Strategy Concepts
 The Board of Directors is the CEO's domain  Boards of Directors are now most interested in cyber security issues  Security is an issue CEO's are largely ill-equipped to address  Score cool points for your CEO with her board  Regularly address the Board on a recurring basis
 Potential Success Patterns
 Defusing a tough security question from thorny board members  Providing security context for potential new business ventures
15

#RSAC
Ninja Mind Trick #4 ­ Enable New Markets or Products
 Key Strategy Concepts
 I abhor terms like "alignment" or "enabling the business" however....  Providing enough confidence to conduct commerce or enter new markets
allows CEO to expand top line  Security context allows CEOs to make calculated risks in new markets or
products  Can communicate these calculated risks to internal and external
stakeholders, raising level of confidence  Consistently helps

Ninja Mind Trick #6 ­ Prevent the CEO from Getting Fired
