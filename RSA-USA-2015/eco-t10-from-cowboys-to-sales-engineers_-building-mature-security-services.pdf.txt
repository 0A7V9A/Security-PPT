Introduction
Many companies and industries are facing disruptions.
Information security services that worked in stable environments can't meet new demands. If security services aren't run like a business, `heroic' individuals will take over with negative consequences.
We will present three case studies to show how to evolve your services and succeed during disruptions.

#RSAC
Information Security in Stable Environments
In stable business and technology environments, process-oriented security services deliver value with:

Well-defined objectives and consistent processes

"Production Engineer"

Timely, high-quality deliverables
Enhancement through various frameworks (e.g. CMMI, ITIL, NIST)

3

#RSAC
Business and Technology Transformation
Companies are facing dramatic business & technology disruptions but traditional security services can't scale or adapt rapidly.

Business innovation more
pervasive
(e.g. Uber, iWatch)

Emerging technologies accelerating

Cyber attacks intensifying
(e.g. healthcare)

Unpredictable demand peaks more common

4

#RSAC
Cowboys Take Over by Default
As traditional approaches break down in dynamic or disruptive environments, "cowboys" will:

Handle demand spikes through heroics

Hire hotshot experts for each new security domain or technology

"Renegade Cowboy"

Impose inflexible solutions by waving the governance stick Neglect service improvement and disregard customer feedback
5

#RSAC
The Problems with Cowboys
This ad hoc approach may work in the short term but will eventually lead to:
High costs and future rework Inconsistent or reduced quality
Long ramp-up times during demand spikes
Pushback from stakeholders
6

#RSAC
Modern Security Services Development
Instead, evolve security services into businesses that scale and adapt.

Operationalize Everything
Scalable delivery with increased responsiveness and consistent quality

Delivery Operations

Generate Data-Driven Insights
Rapid investment reprioritization and strategic realignment

Data

Sales & Marketing

Market Everywhere
Customer-focused for higher satisfaction and engagement

Service Offering

Always Update Product
Relevant options to meet every internal need

7

#RSAC
Running Security Services Like a Business

"Sales Engineer"

Sales & Marketing Build awareness, buy-in, and brand for security services
Service Offerings Develop and maintain catalog of scalable services based on customer feedback
Delivery Operations Deliver efficiently, reliably, aligned with demand
Data and Information Technology Create, manage, and utilize data and systems to optimize all service functions
Human Resources Source and staff with right skills, experience levels, and type (FTE/contractors)
Finance Obtain internal or external financing to develop and deliver services
Administrative Ensure timely execution of all active engagements (consulting engagement manager)

Case Study 1: #RSAC
Product Management

#RSAC
Product Feature and Stakeholder Gap
Security services are not managed as products and fail to meet evolving customer needs. Prior to 2012, our security design service was becoming misaligned with stakeholders.
Reduced Effectiveness
Pushback from Stakeholders
Low Satisfaction & Bad Publicity
One size fits all pricing model
10

#RSAC
Product Management Approach
We treated the design service as a product and applied product management techniques to better meet stakeholder needs, e.g. moving away from single design and pricing model.

Conducted internal market
research to identify
feature gaps

Developed product roadmap
with a list of prioritized features

Offered product choices and tiered pricing
(e.g. number of technologies)

Promoted accountability for engagement
decisions
(signoffs)

Collected data for strategic decision making
(process & delivery metrics)

11

#RSAC
Benefits of Security Product Management
The new security design service offered multiple size and pricing levels, resulting in increased coverage and a dramatic decrease in risks.
Other benefits:
Early adoption of security solutions
Reduced rework
Improved operational visibility
12

Lessons Learned
Adapt service features to
1 stakeholder needs using frequent feedback
3 Hold stakeholders accountable for their decisions

#RSAC
Provide only realistic
2 design options with tiered cost and risk levels
4 Conduct customer experience surveys

Case Study 2:

Marketing Development

#RSAC

#RSAC
Passive Demand Management
Security services can't manage demand effectively without marketing. Prior to 2013, IT leaders at my organization lacked awareness of the design service or understanding of its value proposition, resulting in:

Sporadic or delayed engagements

Low or variable security utilization

Risk of being replaced

Excessive security risks

15

#RSAC
Marketing Development Approach
In 2012, we started to actively market to better manage demand and resource utilization.

Customized messages to promote positive outcomes
(e.g. risk, business value)

Built proactive marketing campaigns

Discovered stakeholder incentives, drives, and needs
(e.g. integration ease, costs)

Surveyed stakeholder satisfaction and engagement
(e.g. repeat "sales")

16

#RSAC
Sample `Pre-Sales' Marketing Collateral
We customized messages to each stakeholder, e.g. ease of technical integration for IT or recurring costs for business. The presentations:
Used non-IT metaphors Addressed misconceptions
Proactively answered questions Invested in visuals
17

#RSAC
Sample `Post-Sales' Marketing Collateral
We connected deliverables to specific business benefits.
Executive Summary & Thank You emails
Created 1-page visual summary supported by hard data
Thanked all our stakeholders to gain future support
18

#RSAC
Benefits of Service Marketing

Reduced pushback and clear value proposition

More predictable demand

Pre-allocated budget instead of
variable

Enhanced product features through
feedback

19

Lessons Learned
1 Develop clear value proposition for the service
3 Always Be Closing (ABC)

#RSAC
Build visually appealing,
2 concise, and relevant service marketing materials Enhance customer
4 engagement by building long-term relationships

Case Study 3:

Scalable Operations

#RSAC

#RSAC
Security Design Services Difficult to Scale
Major business changes driven by healthcare reform triggered a IT implementation spike from 2011-2013. Initially, my organization thought security architecture could not scale.
Typical responses and outcomes:

Hire many contract architects Overload existing staff Take shortcuts on standards and process

Inconsistent quality High cost or future rework Resource burnout, turnover, and lost institutional knowledge

22

#RSAC
Building Security Scalability Approach
We maximized service scalability by using a predefined set of product components rather than building custom deliverables.

Mature architecture process to analyze, design, and make specific technical security recommendations

Technology-agnostic security systems analysis to create technical security recommendations

Prebuilt repository of custom requirements, test cases, and communications

Resource pool of generalist security experts with a process mindset

23

#RSAC
Sample Process Artifacts
We used libraries of prebuilt artifacts to automate tasks that can be executed without architectural expertise.
Communication plan with predefined messages and communication objectives for each expert SME interaction
Security requirements, design patterns, and test scenarios for common use cases
24

#RSAC
Benefits of Operationalized Architecture

-80%
Reduced ramp up time for new resources
(12 weeks to 2)
30-40%
Improved delivery time

$500k
Lowered costs
60%
Increased time to market
(1.5 months > 2 Weeks)

25

Lessons Learned
Hire highly skilled
1 experienced professionals to make decisions
Use work artifact templates
3 (SOW, requirements, design, etc.) not just for final deliverables

#RSAC
Combine repeatable process
2 and security experts-- not technology experts
4 Develop communications plan
