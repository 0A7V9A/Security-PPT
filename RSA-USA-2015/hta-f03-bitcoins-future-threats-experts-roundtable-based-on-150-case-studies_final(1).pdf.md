Why are Bitcoin targets so attractive?

#RSAC
Questions
 Does Bitcoin facilitate money laundry, or its detection? Both? Neither?  How anonymous is Bitcoin?  How does an attack against an exchange usually start?  Does cryptocurrency promote ransomware  Will we see more of CryptoLocker clones in the future demanding Bitcoin for encrypted file
ransom?  Which threat vector will impact Bitcoin's future most?  What opportunities does Bitcoin bring to the security industry?  How will Bitcoin impact the security industry?  How to boost Bitcoin's wide adoption?  Which threat vector is likely under-rated?

#RSAC

vulnerabilities

 Vulns in open source Bitcoin projects  3rd party vulns  Application vulns (OWASP)

#RSAC
Mining resources theft
 Seizing pro miners, Dell: stealing $9,000 a day  German police: botnet mined 700,000 bitcoins  Miner botnets (ex: DVRs, cams, NAS...)  University servers  Hidden miners (ex: games)  Android app miners
(ex: wallpapers apps)

#RSAC
Mining resources theft: Embedded Devices
 Compromises: embedded ARM, PPC, MIPS or X86 machines  Attack vector: default passwords, a vuln in /cgi-bin/php  Primary targets: cheap Linux-based embedded devices, ex:
 Dahua camera - arm  AFoundry switch - mips  Tera EP Wifi Broadband Switch - mips
 Mines MNC coin via p2pool.org

Mining resources theft
 Botnets - Some also have injects for bitcoin theft, i.e this Zeus modification: https://bigrc.biz/threads/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BC-botnet-evolution%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82.9505/

#RSAC
Bitcoin malware trends
 Malware is and will be an important tool for coin thieves against end users
 Attack wallet files or website logins  Desktop and mobile  Interest from malware authors is proportional to the Bitcoin price
and adoption in their target demographic  Dropped in 2014 along with price [Symantec]  As adoption grows, average technical savvy of user will drop

Defending Against Bitcoin Malware
 For now, most Bitcoin malware will simply be standard financial trojans. Use traditional methods of detection
 Behavioral analysis: processes scanning for `wallet.dat', `wallet.aes.json' or Base58Check strings all potentially suspicious
 Put private keys offline and into cold storage; use offline signing
 Security proportional to amount of funds stored, even during upward price swings
 Multi-stage signing protocols such as P2SH multisig, Shamir's Secret Sharing, or threshold sigs distribute risk

#RSAC
Crime and terrorism
 Bitcoin as gaming credits (ex: gambling)  Bitcoin as payment protocol for criminal trade  Bitcoin used to fund or to donate to terrorists  Bitcoin as means to launder money

#RSAC
Insider threat
 Current operators or employees  Ex-employees  Fake "compromises"  US Department of Justice: US Secret
Service agent "diverted" more than $800,000 in Bitcoins to his personal accounts
