In the Words of Dr. Dan Geer...
"One can only conclude that replacing some part of the human cybersecurity worker's job description with automation is necessary. If the threat space is expanding by X to the Y, then the defense has to arm up accordingly. An accelerating share of the total cybersecurity responsibility will have to be automated, will have to be turned over to machines."
"People in the Loop: Are They a Failsafe or a Liability?" (8 February 2012) http://geer.tinho.net/geer.suitsandspooks.8ii12.txt

Or Maybe Verizon DBIR 2015?
"It may not be obvious at first glance, but the common denominator across the top four patterns - accounting for nearly 90% of all incidents - is people. Whether it's goofing up, getting infected, behaving badly, or losing stuff, most incidents fall in the PEBKAC and ID-10T über-patterns." (p32)

Problem Statement
"A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem." ­Albert Einstein

#RSAC

Busy Work and Noise

Impact

Scary! BCM

#RSAC
What to do?
Automate!
For Scalability & Resiliency For Better Quality / Less Errors For Agility & Responsiveness

#RSAC
Analytics, AI, & Automation

 Current State  Just starting to become mainstream...  See: DevOps  Infosec needs to catch up to ops & dev...
 Many dependencies
 What's the motivation?  All these breaches, yet life goes on...  Are we trading one "risk" for another?  $$$ is not insignificant!

Caveat / Warning:
"The question is under what circumstances that we still control can that turning over be a good thing? How can we put a human back into the loop such that that human *is* a failsafe."
(Dr. Geer, also Feb 2012)

#RSAC
Benefits of an Automated Future
 Transparent federated authentication & high-assurance ID  Goodbye card fraud  Hello "easier life" - greatly reduces friction (shopping, travel (TSA), legal matters, financial matters, hiring, etc, etc, etc)  Privacy sidebar: who has control: you or an entity (corp/gov)?
 Wearables lead to real-time medical tracking and alerts  "Grandma, we see you've fallen, can you get up?"
 Revisiting the long tail...  Or, social clustering and the reinforcement of confirmation bias...

#RSAC
Benefits of an Automated Future
 Transparent federated authN, high-assurance ID  Self-defending networks? e.g., NAC+DDoS Mitigation+IPS+???  Knock down high frequency noise  Application security testing automation  Address low-end skills gaps through AI+automation
Key Objective: Scaling while minimizing human error

#RSAC
Targets for Automation: A Few Examples

 Internal DNS updates  Firewall rule deployments  Access deployments & terminations  Account reconciliation  HR/Legal holds  Incident context for investigations  Application security

Pick "low risk" activities that are easily scripted.
Note: Yes, we already see some of these things
being automated today!

Things to Consider...
 Are you copying data from one system to paste into another?
 Are there highly repetitive tasks that could be automated with basic data input?
 Automation is not the absence of manual intervention, but the facilitation of smarter manual involvement only as needed!
With automation comes the impetus for positive resource utilization shifts. Now you can survive with a couple high-value resources instead of entire teams of them. Automation not only improves scalability, but it also improves quality by reducing human error!

#RSAC
What Tools Can You Use?
This is just a quick sampling... literally dozens more, FOSS or commercial!

#RSAC
The Evolutionary Imperative
 We must evolve, or we will die.  Evolution is in response to survivalist intuition.  Choose to survive!

#RSAC
Survival Tips
 Shift risk management mindset  architecting for resiliency  DevOps + "all the world's a cloud" + IRM  Embrace the benefits of utility compute power  Automate where possible, shift resources to important things!
 Empower users  The secure choice should be the easy choice  Don't be a barrier!  Incentivize good decisions
 Remember: It's not just about achieving an ideal!

#RSAC
My Grand Vision

#RSAC

#RSAC
Apply What You Have Learned Today
 Now:
 Identify targets for automation  Begin building foundational tool chains (e.g., ops orchestration)  Establish key repositories (e.g., IDM system of record)
 Soon:
 Implement & deploy!
 Long-term:
 Automate first, manually intervene second (humans as failsafe)
