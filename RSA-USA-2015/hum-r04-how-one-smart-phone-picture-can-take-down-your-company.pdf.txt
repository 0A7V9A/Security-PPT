What Are Some Common Low-Tech Threats?
 You've probably heard of low-tech threats like:  Social Engineering  Spear Phishing  Malicious Insiders  Physical Device/File Theft

#RSAC
Visual Hacking: The Lurking Low-Tech Threat
 Visual Hacking is a fifth, under-addressed low-tech threat  What is Visual Hacking?: A low-tech method used to capture
sensitive, confidential and private information for unauthorized use  What is Visual Privacy?: The act of protecting sensitive,
confidential and private information from visual hacking  Informal Poll: Raise your hand if this has ever happened to you
4

#RSAC
Why is Visual Hacking an Issue?
 Visual hacking is a weak point when protecting information through the pipeline (data in motion, data at rest, data in use)
 Visual hacking is a stealth threat vector, virtually untraceable
 As high-tech data security solutions become more and more sophisticated, hackers will shift from hacking systems to hacking people
 Visual hacking could be the gateway to a largescale attack

Visual Hacking Controls Help

#RSAC
 In all instances, those companies that employed visual hacking controls, including mandatory training & awareness, clean desk policies, standardized document shredding process, suspicious reporting process and use of privacy filters, had fewer pieces of information hacked than those that did not

15

#RSAC
Conclusions
· Visual hacking is an under-addressed corporate risk with potentially detrimental consequences
· A hacker often only needs one piece of valuable information to unlock a large-scale data breach. This study exposes both how simple it is for a hacker to attain sensitive data using only visual means, as well as employee carelessness and a lack of awareness to data security threats
· Low-tech threats, such as visual hacking, can be as detrimental to companies as high-tech threats

Case Studies

#RSAC
Global Management Firm
 Business Case  Many consultants travel or work from client's offices regularly  A partner was on a plane traveling to a client. On the computer screen in clear text were client-attorney privileged documents and one of the firm's clients just happened to be seated next to the partner. The client contacted the firm's legal department and filed a complaint  Chief Compliance Officer: "There is growing awareness among the consultants about the social engineering risk that occurs during travel. Many were not aware that potentially a cyber criminal whose sole purpose is to obtain credentials and personal information could be in the next seat."
 Solution  Privacy and data protection practices were updated to include situations involving travel with laptops and tablets. Privacy training now includes visual privacy as a discussion point
18

#RSAC
Takeaway: Develop a Risk-Based Approach
 Different job functions & categories work have access to varying degrees of confidential information
 Roll out controls based on risk level  Criteria includes
 Level within the organization  C-Suite, Board of Directors, Directors, Managers
 Sensitivity of data managed  PII, financial records, customer payment info
 Time spent working outside the office  Frequency of travel
19

Takeaway: Protect Against Low-Tech Threats #RSAC in Public Places
 Laptops and mobile devices are equipped with privacy filters  Confidential documents are not reviewed in public places  Sensitive information is not verbally discussed while on the phone
or in-person  Devices or confidential documents are not left unattended for any
period of time  Personally identifiable information is not shared verbally or
displayed on a screen as it may lead to a spear phishing attack
20

#RSAC
National Retail Bank
 Business Case  A mock audit was conducted to determine the company's readiness to complete a full-scale compliance audit by banking regulators  During the audit it was discovered that the tellers' work spaces could be easily observed by co-workers and banking customers
 Solution  Employee communication channels used to spread results of mock audit  Chief Compliance Officer working to make privacy products including privacy filters mandatory at every branch: "I sleep better knowing that the use of the privacy filters is spreading throughout the branches."
21

#RSAC
Takeaway: Conduct Your Own Mock Audit
 Desk Areas:
 Computer screens are angled away from high-traffic areas and equipped with privacy filters
 Physical documents including company information are removed from plain view & placed in a locked drawer or box
 Passwords not displayed on visible paper  USB drives removed from devices after use & put in a secure place  Keys, access cards and bags containing devices or company
documents are not left unattended for any period of time
22

#RSAC
Takeaway: Conduct Your Own Mock Audit
 Copy Area  Documents & copies are promptly removed from printers/copiers  Confidential and sensitive documents are shredded
 Common Areas  Email and other sensitive documents are closed before projecting onto a presentation screen  Sensitive documents are not being reviewed in public areas, adjust physical position so that documents are angled toward a solid wall (not windows)  Confidential information should not be verbally discussed in common areas  Privacy filters used on laptops/mobile devices  Information is erased off of white boards following a meeting or work session
23

#RSAC
National Retail Pharmacy Chain
 Business Case  A main concern is the industry regulations that must be complied with, namely HIPPA and other state laws regarding the protection and handling of protected health information (PHI)  Working in an open retail environment raises the level of concern for low-tech threats. Customers are often in close proximity to sensitive information  Chief Privacy Officer, "For us, customer trust is critical. We are in a highly competitive and regulated industry. It is important that we demonstrate to our customers that we understand the information they are sharing is extremely personal. Trust should be integral to our culture."
 Solution  Mandatory privacy education trainings for all clinical employees and management, focus is on communicating policies and procedures for data protection coupled with tools like privacy filters on kiosks
24

Takeaway: How to Create an Effective Data

#RSAC

Security Communication Plan

 Target Your Audiences

 Provide Ongoing Education

25

Takeaway: Creating your Data Privacy /

#RSAC

Security Toolkit

 Layer physical and software security technologies for a defense-in-depth approach
 Equip newly-issued devices with pre-installed security technologies  Could include privacy filters, encryption software, IAM, remote wipe capabilities, physical locks
 Require masked passwords on devices
 Provide secure storage for sensitive documents and enact a clean desk policy
 Equip copy rooms with shredders to dispose of confidential documents

26

Creating a Visual Privacy

#RSAC

Standard

Where Visual Privacy Standards Fit Within the #RSAC Larger Data Security Policy
 This standard may fall under any number of security and privacy policy sections depending on how your company structures the IT Security plan, including but not limited to:  Identity and Access Management Policy  Privacy Policy  Compliance Policy
28

#RSAC
Component 1: Worker Adherence
 Use this section to clearly outline the functions and levels of workers that should adhere to the standard.  Example: All company workers (employee, contingent/contract workers, and temporary staff) who fit the following criteria of being at high risk for visual hacking.  Business travelers (flying, commuting on public transit, etc.)  Those who frequently access company information that is confidential or regulated. This type of information could include but is not limited to Financial, HR, Customer Data, Trade Secret, etc. Special attention should be paid to situations where office floor plans are open and walk-by visual access is common  Those who regularly spend time working outside the office (accessing email and texts or working on company confidential documents)  Those in leadership roles within the company
29

#RSAC
Component 2: Standard Statement
 Use this section to outline how and where company workers should use tools like privacy filter (desktop and laptop computers) and privacy screen protector (smartphone and tablets) products, password masking etc.  Example: Use privacy filters and privacy screen protector products and password masking to help protect company information from unauthorized views:  On all in-office devices used by at-risk employees that have a high risk for walk-by visual hacking  On all devices used to access company information in public areas  On all devices used by employees when working outside the office, including home or remote office
30

Summary
 It's easy to get caught up in the "flavor of the week" of privacy and security measures ­ don't forget the basics & low-tech threats
 Equipping workers with tools like privacy filters & password masking, which can help mitigate the human factor, should be coupled with ongoing education and communication efforts to maximize impact
 Encouraging a culture within the office where data privacy and security are held in the highest regard will be important moving forward as hacks will only continue to grow in number and impact
36

#RSAC
Apply: Where to Go From Here
 Next week you should:  Review your company's policies and standards to determine if they address lowtech threats like visual hacking
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:  Complete a mock audit to identify vulnerabilities within the organization for low-tech threats  Categorize employees into risk groups for visual hacking attacks and begin to roll out controls to those deemed most "at risk"  Begin including low-tech threats in ongoing data privacy & security education and communication efforts
37

#RSAC
Apply: Where to Go From Here
 Within six months you should:
 Ensure that a Visual Privacy Standard has been adopted, if not addressed in current policies
