We are Being Defeated, What's Happening?
 We have the technology, the brains, the funding....
The attackers operate in a known environment! The attackers job is more predictable!! Their lives are easier!!! Our operations are slow... reactive... We are running into a skill gap/fatigue... We don't make their life hard enough...

#RSAC
What's the "driver's" role?

What's the "Pilot's" role?
The Human role:
Leaving to the human the intentions & final decisions!!

Recommending New IOCs

 When the analyst creates a new IOC the system can recommend:
 How strong is this new IOC by itself?
 Is it similar to already existing IOC?
 What is the best threshold setting (if applicable)?
 Recommends new IoC

New Recommended IoCs, based on combining existing IoCs

Taking the Data Science Path
 THINK DIFFERENTLY
 Data science is not a feature -> it's a methodology!  Data science capabilities should synergize, empower and enhance the
security experts -> not replace them!!
 USE DATA SCIENCE - Building your own (??)
 Skills and expertise  How specific are your requirements  Learning from the past ­ BI, web analytics, retail analytics  Leveraging the community and crowd sourcing
