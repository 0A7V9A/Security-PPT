Mobile Fraud Examples
 Fraudsters use stolen credentials on mobile devices to:
 Purchase goods with the victim's debit/credit cards  Gather more info about the victim to be used/sold for fraud purposes
 Name, address, phone, email, order history, address book, etc.
 Send money via BillPay service, etc.  Access sensitive information (i.e. bank account records)  Lock real user out of account (ransomware)
 Fraudsters create thousands of accounts they control to:
 Test and use stolen credit/debit card numbers  Spam/phish other users

Why is stopping mobile fraud harder?
 Identifying and stopping fraud on mobile is very different from web
 IP address pool is small on many carriers  Device fingerprinting is less effective and less mature  Cookie tracking is limited
 Solutions that work for web fraud are far less effective for mobile fraud

 Total losses present large potential revenue if fraud eliminated.  Given these losses, companies are not spending enough on security.  Companies must increase level of expenditure on remediation of losses.
 Investing as little as 10%-20% of the yearly losses in enhanced security would provide significant boost to organization's ability to limit or eliminate the losses resulting from fraud.

What Can I Do?

#RSAC
Rogue App's
 Detect and shutdown apps targeting customers in public app stores
 Don't forget the "non-public" ones too!
 Perform App Scanning on device  Suggest "AV" for the mobile

#RSAC
Perform Big Data Risk Analytics
 Who you are?  What is the device that you are
coming from?  Did we see this device?  Did we see this behavior?  Did we see this origin location?  Is the device compromised?  What do you typically do?
 And more...
