What's next
 Your job is to make sure leadership understands the risks and are equipped to make decision on where to accept it
 Build consensus on criteria, definition, impact ranking and visualization of risk
 Implement a plan based on return on impact of risk mitigation

#RSAC
How to get more info
 Start with NIST http://nist.gov/cyberframework/index.cfm (specifically the 800 series ­ covers both risk and implementation)
 MITRE and CMU have both done great work on metrics to use to develop your radar
 For risk radar here are key terms for different techniques: heat map, spider chart and quad chart, framework, scorecard and dashboard
