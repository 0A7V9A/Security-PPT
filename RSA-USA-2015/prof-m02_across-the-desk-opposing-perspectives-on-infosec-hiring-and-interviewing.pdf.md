#RSAC
The dynamics of the job search and the hiring process are often misunderstood. This leads to bad decisions.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser

#RSAC
Competition is strong for both infosec candidates and jobs. Many companies are hiring; many people are entering the field (8-17% per year growth in certs).
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
3

#RSAC
"There is a shortage of good jobs" -- Candidate
"There is a shortage of qualified candidates" -- Hiring Manager
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
4

#RSAC
The hiring manager and the candidate persuade each other of the right fit. Each party in the interview process is selfmotivated and has their own interests in mind.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
5

Presentation:
#RSAC
How to describe the candidate and the job?

#RSAC
The resume is the job candidate's primary marketing document. But it is often overvalued.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
7

#RSAC
The job description is the hiring manager's marketing documents. It is often undervalued.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
8

#RSAC
The job title is a signaling mechanism. It can be a point of contention.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
9

#RSAC
Look beyond the resume, title and job description. They will not be all-encompassing.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
10

#RSAC
Online reputation is critical for both employers and candidates. It needs to reflect the brand you wish to portray.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
11

Expertise:
#RSAC
What skills to possess and to demand?

#RSAC
Technical skills form the baseline for establishing the fit. They are just the beginning.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
13

#RSAC
Industry-specific knowledge of the business is increasingly important for information security.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
14

#RSAC
Communication skills for infosec professionals are critical. They can be a differentiator.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
15

#RSAC
Management opportunities can be seen by candidates as a career progression. Not all of us should be managers.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
16

Negotiations:
#RSAC
How to get what you need or want?

#RSAC
Each party in the negotiation should strive to understand each other's position, strengths and weaknesses.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
18

#RSAC
Balancing the seesaw: Parties may have more influence at different times throughout the negotiations.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
19

#RSAC
Understand which requirements and compensation items are actually negotiable. Money is important, but remember other aspects of the overall package.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
20

#RSAC
Both parties need to know their own BATNA: Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. Understand when and how to walk away from the negotiations.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser

What does this

#RSAC

mean for you?

#RSAC
Like in dating, finding the right match in a candidate and employer is hard. There are many variables to consider and track.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
23

#RSAC
Understanding the other party's perspective is key to a successful outcome.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
24

#RSAC
Remember, you're always interviewing. You're always recruiting.
Lee Kushner and Lenny Zeltser
25

#RSAC
Apply "Across the Desk" Concepts
 Review and revise your current job descriptions / resume / brand  Consider what technical and "soft" skills are truly required?  If engaged in interviewing now, outline the other party's negotiation
objectives and BATNA  Reflect upon a recent job negotiation--what would you have done
differently?  Review and customize the cheat sheet at
