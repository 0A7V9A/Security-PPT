Detection
 Detecting malicious activity on your network is hard
 Detecting malicious activity targeting your users OUTSIDE OF YOUR NETWORK is even harder
 Difficult to monitor ALL possible communication VECTORS and data transmission MEDIUMS
13

#RSAC
Attribution, Motive, and Extent
 More difficult still to determine ATTRIBUTION, MOTIVE, and EXTENT
 TARGETED or OPPORTUNISTIC attack?  CARELESS/CLICK-HAPPY employee or
MALICIOUS INSIDER?  ISOLATED INCIDENT or LONG RUNNING
campaign?

Links, Links, Links
 The number of social sites is GROWING
 Social communications (e.g. Twitter)  Social engagement (e.g. Facebook)  Social sharing (e.g. Instagram)  Blogging (e.g. Wordpress)
 With them, the number of embedded URLs
15

#RSAC
Moving At The Speed of Social
 With more URLs, comes more creativity from malicious actors
 The obfuscation of malicious sites is increasing
 e.g. using URL shorteners
 Employing "confusion tactics" is commonplace
 e.g. fonts, spelling, etc.

Avoiding Typhoid Mary
 Let's take a look at some DNS TRAFFIC that you could expect to see via popular social media channels
 At the VERY LEAST you should be able to MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS
17

#RSAC
Example 1 ­ URL Shorteners

Example 1 ­ URL Shorteners (continued...)
19

#RSAC
Example 1 ­ URL Shorteners (continued...)
 URL shorteners are deterministic, thus the same URL gets encoded to the same shortened URL every time
 Run a discovered attack URL through every URL shortener, and then search for that URL through Google.

#RSAC
Example 3 ­ Fraudulent Websites
 Let's look at a seemingly innocuous domain
gfuel-alternative-energy[.]co[.]za
26

#RSAC
Example 3 ­ Fraudulent Websites
 However, gfuel-alternative-energy[.]co[.]za, has previously appeared in the block list
27

#RSAC
Example 3 ­ Fraudulent Websites
 And, gfuel-alternative-energy[.]co[.]za, has previously been tagged as a phishing site

 But everything is fixed now, right?

Example 3 ­ Fraudulent Websites
 Looks to be taken down

Example 3 ­ Fraudulent Websites
 If that one is removed, surely the older one has been removed, right?

The Good News
What enables the wise sovereign and the good general
to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is
foreknowledge.
--Sun Tzu
33

#RSAC
The Good News
 For the clever security professional, social media is a gold mine of publicly-facing, proactive intelligence
 Social media data can be leveraged to enhance existing security tools
 The newest threat vector is simultaneously the newest security OSINT repository
 Threats are circulated in broad daylight
34

#RSAC
Think About it This Way
35

#RSAC
Your Security Framework Just Got Deeper
 Social media is a robust new layer in any defense-in-depth posture
 Malicious links found on social media means enhanced DNS filters
 As social media continues to grow, leverage it to empower your existing DNS framework

Conclusion
 Defense in depth is more than new boxes on your network  Need Outside-In for Defense in depth  Social enables your business & also creates new vulnerability  Social is either a risk or an ally ­ you decide
