As a New CISO ­ How to Assess Your Security Program for Success

Gary Hayslip
Chief Information Security Officer City of San Diego, California @ghayslip

#RSAC

#RSAC
As a New CISO ­ You'll have more questions than answers
"Visibility"

#RSAC
"Cyber is a Business Enabler"
5 Steps I have used for Success

#RSAC
Step 1 ­ "The Meet & Greet"
 "Security doesn't work in a Vacuum, however it works well in a Community"
 Grow your "Human Network"  Meet your Team  Meet Your Stakeholders  Identify Influencers  Meet Key Executive Leadership
 Know the responsibility & authority of your position  Sometimes its more than what you realize
5

#RSAC
Step 2 ­ "Inventory"
 "To protect your organization, know your enterprise environment"
 People (Team Members, Contractors, Peers)  Reports (Contracts, Metrics, Prior Audits, Inspections)  Architecture (Network, Location, Hardware, Application, Cloud)  Budgets (Security Program, Department, Organization)  Processes & Policies
 (Security Strategy, Policies, Workflows, Laws, Regulations, Compliance)
 Review your Predecessor's documents, emails, notes.
 Now review their notes on your team members

8

#RSAC
Step 3 ­ "Assessment"
 "Continuous Assessment, establish and verify your baseline"
 Health of your Security Suite  Review recent audits, policies, projects
 Current audit findings, recommendations?  Measure Your Security
 Are you meeting your security metrics?  Are you meeting performance metrics?  Are you meeting 3rd Party Assessment Frameworks?  Are you meeting Compliance Requirements?
9

10

#RSAC
Step 4 ­ "Planning"
 "Your Security Program and Team are key to your Organization"
 Draft your "Vision" of the Security Program  Challenges to the current program
 Build your Strategic Security Project Plan  Use your Project Plan to build your Security Budget  Start Immediately (Momentum is key)
 Will Correcting Issues = Clear Business Benefits?  Reduce Risk Exposure?  Will Fixing the Issues = Credibility for your Team?
11

#RSAC

12

#RSAC
Step 5 ­ "Communicate"
 "Visibility = Executive Sponsorship = Budget"
 Socialize your Security Vision  Vision = "Where we want to be"  Assessment = "Where we currently are"  Gap Analysis = (Vision ­ Assessment)  Gap Analysis = Strategic Security Project Plan = Security Budget
 Socialize the Security Gap  Correcting findings brings value to the business
13

#RSAC

14

#RSAC
Some points to remember
 You will be collecting and reviewing an enormous amount of data  This will take time, normally between 3-6 months
 Leverage your "Human Network"  Use your team, your peers, and stakeholders  Don't be afraid to ask for help
 Share your information  Visibility is crucial for your Team and Security Program
15

#RSAC
Conclusion
 At the end of this 3-6 month journey, you will have:
 A "Human Network" to help you drive Cyber in your organization  An updated Inventory of your Organizations Enterprise IT assets  You will know the maturity of your Security Program and your
assessment baseline  You will have created your Strategic Security Project Plan  This plan will help you create your Security Program budget  Better understanding of how "Cyber = Business Value"
 So did you miss anything?  When You get home, what are you going to verify?

My Background

AC

 Current: VP, CISO @ Informatica  New ISO27k security/compliance program, new security product line, culture of security
 My previous lives:

 Investing in InfoSec ­ Building VC Security Investment Thesis  Democratizing Trusted Cloud Security ­ AWS CloudHSM  Architecting, Building and Operating Security @ Scale
21

Why Are We Here?
 Who are you fighting for?
 Shareholders, Owners  Employees, Teammates  Customers, Constituents

#RS AC
 Why do you do this job?!?
 The Challenge, A Puzzle  Protecting Others  Sense of Duty, What's Right

22

#RS

As A Security Leader, You Are Fighting for

AC

 Corporate Budget  Skilled Resources  Employees' Attention  Raising The Security Bar On Your Watch  Improving The Security State Of The Art
... Relevance

23

#RS

Frames of Reference -- Being Relevant

AC

1. Risk vs. Threats 2. Data vs. Opinion 3. Relationships vs.
Transactions 4. Business Impact vs.
Business Disruption 5. Systems vs. Tasks 6. Security vs. Compliance

7. Value vs. Cost 8. Efficiency vs. Effort 9. Results vs. Effort 10.Being Heard vs. Talking 11.Feedback loops

24

#RS

Risk vs. Threats

AC

 Risk ~= Vulnerabilities * Threats * Impact
 You do not control threats
 What the attackers could do
 You do have (some) control over impact, vulnerabilities:
 Patching effectively  Incident response capability  Regular response plan testing
 Focus on what you can control, being prepared
 Helps your program be seen as Being Proactive vs. Reactive

25

#RS

Data vs. Opinion

AC

 Ask yourself: "Who has better data about this situation?"  Have fact-based conversations
1. Establish hypotheses 2. Run experiments to gather data ("A/B Tests") 3. Measure results 4. Prove / Disprove your theories 5. Make decisions to improve security 6. Rinse, repeat

26

#RS

Relationships vs. Transactions

AC

 Move beyond transaction-based personal interactions
 Industry and Peer benchmarks are powerful leverage
 Establishes a neutral or trusted third-party, external expertise  Removes emotion, subjectivity  Ponemon, Gartner, Forrester, WiseGate, peers, etc
 Build & Maintain Relationships ... With Your Security Peers
 Salaries, Budgets, Product Reviews, Training, Feedback, Sanity :)
 ... With Your Company's Peers
 Pre-wiring meetings, Your Program's Support, Their Program's Support

27

#RS

Business Impact vs. Business Disruption

AC

 Business Disruption:
 Applying OS patches typically requires reboots  Critical infrastructure patches lowers availability  Pay down technical debt means we can't ship the new features
 Business Impact:
 Compare security posture, features to your peers, industry benchmarks  Security can be a competitive differentiator, or a "must do", not a tax  Use events like "What if we had the same thing happen to us...?"  Speak to the business impact, not the technical details  Get this on record, have this conversation, build your case

28

#RS

Systems & Programs vs. Tasks

AC

 We know security is an ongoing process, not a task or one-time checklist  Task-focused security appears never-ending
 Hard to show return on investment, results for effort  Minutiae obscures the value of security from project-level work
 Focus on higher-level metrics, regular cadence, objectives, accountability  Build repeatable processes, automation, Programs  Focus on what you can control  Follow program management guidelines, best practices
 Charter, Goals, Sponsorship, Metrics, Review, Cadence, RACI

29

#RS

Systems & Programs vs. Tasks (II)

AC

 Example: Patching, Vulnerability Management is hard work. Never "done".
 Filing individual vulnerabilities & issues is not sustainable  Pre-wire conversations ahead of review meetings to re-affirm expectations, address
concerns  Establish regular cadence with stakeholders to build accountability, credibility,
measure progress  Prioritize the risk of what's discovered, enabled  Measure efficacy and efficiency, not effort  Move beyond "numbers of criticals"  Report "time to close" critical vulnerabilities  Not "100% patched", but "close critical vulns within 2 days of release"  Goal: Sustainable Security Programs

30

#RS

Security vs. Compliance

AC

 Focus on solid security foundations  Compliance will come along for the ride
 "Say It" ­ Policies  "Do It" ­ Procedures & Guidelines  "Prove It" ­ Generate evidence to review  Many standards, pick the best match for your company  Already started with Compliance? Expand into Good Security

31

#RS

Assess once, comply many

#RS

Communicating vs. Talking

AC

 Security is about influencing, selling, advising
 Communications is what The Receiver Does
 To be heard, use their vocabulary  To be effective, use their communications vehicle
 Avoid "Impedance Mismatches"  Operations: Change Requests & Tickets  Engineering: Bug Reports, Feature Requests  Automate filing audit tasks via your ticketing system  Create User Stories for desired security features

35

#RS

Feedback Loops

AC

 Putting it all together ...

 Create tight feedback loops with your stakeholders  Builds relationships, trust  Require metrics, measuring the Right Things  Establish data-based decision making  Reinforce / disprove your hypotheses  Increase your security velocity  This encourages Results, incremental improvements

36

#RS

Recap

AC

#RS

It's All About Results. Do The Following:

AC

 By Next Week
 Time map: Evaluate where [you | your team] is spending its energy  Take your [CIO | Operations Peer | Engineer Peer ] to lunch
 With Next Quarter
 Assess what metrics are truly impactful. Eliminate the rest.  For a month, measure your time-to-remediate vulns on one critical system or subnet  Identify 3 repeatable tasks you can automate
 By the End of This Year
 Take your [General Council | Chief Product Officer | etc] to lunch. Share top metrics.  Automate at least 2 repeatable audit or security tasks  Create 1+ feedback loop on a task with your Operations or Engineer peer

Apply Slide
 Develop your team's culture to match the business, not as a subculture of security
 Should set aside time for strategic planning  To be successful, you must be able to keep people calm, shield
your team from pressures, and handle the stress yourself  Developing and maintaining strong peer networks is key  You must get comfortable "living in the grey"  Educate yourself about the business

#RSAC
Asking the Obvious Questions

#RSAC
Obvious Questions
 Executive interactions must always answer:
 What do I need to know?  Why does it matter? / What do I care?  What do you need from me?
 This is both SIMPLE and HARD!

#RSAC
Obvious Questions ­ know your audience
 Are you the first "CISO" to present?  Who are you presenting to?
 For how long?  How often?
 How are the CIO/CFO/GC incentivized?

#RSAC
Obvious Questions ­ soul searching
Discussing  Unknowns  Vulnerabilities  Incidents
suicide or demonstration of strength?

Affecting Change:

#RSAC

Rapid7's Research Project

#RSAC
Affecting Change: Expanding the Survey
 A Quantitative and Qualitative Survey  Need > 250 CISOs and Non-Security Executives  Takes less than 15 minutes of someone's time  Results in an open source "Playbook" for CISOs
 What should be reported? (Routine vs Special Requests)  Mapping to Common Security Frameworks

#RSAC
Affecting Change: Take it Yourself / Contribute
 Please take 15 minutes to complete the survey TODAY
bit.ly/CISOSurvey2015
 Then, pass it along:
 2 security colleagues  3 non-security colleagues!

#RSAC
How to Apply What You've Learned
 Today you should:
 Take Rapid7's CISO Reporting Survey
 In the next two weeks:
 Evaluate what your teams are reporting  Think about how non-security executives will consume the results  Modify your metrics and report to focus more on business risk
 In the next 3 months:
 Contact the consumers of your updated reports  Ask for feedback vs. previous months / years
