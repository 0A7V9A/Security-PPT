States collect, share and use large volumes of the most comprehensive citizen information.

Makes states an attractive target for both organized cyber criminals and hactivists.

Cybersecurity needs to be a governor and a business executive level issue.

Moving forward...
Role and governance
 Governance, Risk and Compliance: CISOs could continue to manage the strategic, risk management, and regulatory/compliance functions
 Privacy: Enterprise-level privacy officers can help determine which data needs to be protected and why
 Security technology and operations: A security executive could manage technical and operational aspects of security

Strategize & achieve appropriate funding
 Communicate and collaborate with legislators and state business/program leadership to build a business case for security as a line item in the budget
 Effectively collaborate with agency-level program and business leaders to get cybersecurity included in program budgets
 Work with CIOs to:
 Allocate a reasonable percentage of new business and technology initiatives for cybersecurity
 Identify creative ways to include cybersecurity as a critical part of enterprise data center consolidation initiatives

Moving forward...
Unravel the complexity
 Use both increasing regulatory requirements and audit findings to gain the attention of business and agency/program leaders
 Clearly communicate the nature and severity of cyber risks and impacts to business stakeholders, agency/program leaders and legislative leaders
 State cybersecurity approach needs to evolve ­ can't rely on protection or securing efforts alone
