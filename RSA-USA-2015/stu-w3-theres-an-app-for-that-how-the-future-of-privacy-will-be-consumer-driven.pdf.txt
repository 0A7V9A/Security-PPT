What Does Love Have to Do with it?
 Every large positive global change that impacts people comes from Love... our poetry, our expressions, the letters we write to our loved ones...
 Should our most precious feelings, emotions and passions be exposed to others & observed in some lab without our consent?

Simplicity Is the Secret
 If Privacy is so important? Why are most of the top apps useless games and picture editing tools?
 Privacy is currently hard. Hard to navigate. Hard to use.  There is an app for social networking. An app for fetching a taxi.
An app for getting your dry cleaning picked up. These apps are less important, but very simple to use.  The secret to taking Privacy Main Stream is Simplicity.

Laureates, Great Thinkers & Revolutionaries...

 As my friend and Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Jonathan Granoff says: "Love grows in the most private quarters. Intrusion into those private quarters violates the natural preciousness of the individual."

Who created the Internet? The government or tech companies?

Privacy, Policy, Products: What Does the

FCC Think?

 In 1993-94, the Clinton Administration recognized that the Internet could become the most important information platform for the world
 The FCC allowed the Internet to "borrow" the physical infrastructure of the existing telephone network at no charge
 Reed Hundt, the chairman of the FCC at the time and a current AnchorFree Advisory Board member quotes: "Everything happened as we hoped, only faster and better than expected."

#RSAC
Privacy, Policy, Products
 The real impact on Privacy will come from technologies and products, not from policy folks
 Policy people think about Privacy Policies, product people think about how to solve a real world problem for the next billion people
 However, Policy can help shape Privacy, in a similar way to how the FCC helped make the Internet available to all

Summary
 Our most private & personal data is at risk; stealing our data is a multi-billion dollar business.
 Privacy is a basic human right, but is constantly at risk.  It is up to us to protect our data.  Public Wi-Fi, Wearables, and Internet of Things are most
at risk.  Easy Privacy Solutions exist and are becoming mainstream.
