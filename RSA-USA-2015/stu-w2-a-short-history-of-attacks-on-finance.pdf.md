u Most Financial Malware is Man In The Browser malware
u The aim is to defeat SSL / TLS u Malware hooks the browser u Modifies pages after it exits the
SSL tunnel

Cybercrime kits - 2006
u In 2006 ZeuS appears u The original cybercrime kit u Now anyone can run an attack u Author goes by the name of
Slavik u ZeuS becomes very popular

#RSAC
SpyEye enters the stage - 2009
u SpyEye comes out in 2009 gunning for ZeuS market share
u First versions were terrible! u But cheap: $1000 versus $8000 u Author is Gribodemon u Adopts ZeuS config style u A battle ensues...

Not the only game in town
u ZeuS and SpyEye were not the only game in town
u Carberp ­ attacks in Europe u Then went after Russian banks ­
key members arrested in 2012 u Sinowal or "The one that got
away" ­ closed group u Disappeared in 2013 - unusual

An unholy alliance - 2010

What happened

What actually happened

u In October 2010 ZeuS is at version 2.0.8.9
u Suddenly Slavik announces he is quitting and

u Slavik was part of a gang using ZeuS to go after high value accounts ­ JabberZeuS
u More profitable than selling ZeuS

handing over support and development to Gribodemon, author of SpyEye!

u Wants to get rid of kit business
u Starts work on next version which becomes P2PZeuS

#RSAC
A big leak - 2011
u Early 2011 the entire ZeuS 2.0.8.9 source code leaks
u Lots of new families appear u ICE-IX u Citadel u KINS
u Cost of malware goes down
10

#RSAC
The end of SpyEyes - 2013
u Gribodemon never releases a SpyZeuS
u Instead he too starts working on a managed version of SpyEye, SpyEye2
u But he is arrested in 2013 while on holiday in Costa Rica and extradited to the US
11

#RSAC
P2PZeuS ­ Halcyon days and demise
u From 2011 ­ 2014, P2PZeuS is immensely popular
u Active worldwide u Many groups use it as a platform for
attacks u In 2014 after years of investigation
lead by the FBI botnet is taken down u And Slavik's identity becomes
known
12

#RSAC
And so to the present day
u Former P2PZeuS customers building alternative platforms: Dyre and Dridex
u Remnants of Carberp group involved with Anunak ­ attacks against retail and Russian banks
u Other groups now focusing on retail ­ Point of Sale
u Copycat Ransomware
13

#RSAC
What should you take away?
u Financial malware has come a long way ­ attacks more sophisticated
u Actors in this space are diversifying ­ retail, ransomware u Threats evolve, they don't appear out of nowhere u Context helps you understand - taking a longer view makes things
clearer u Look beyond the malware
