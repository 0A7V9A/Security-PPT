Yes, we are the best but..
 We don't have endless budget.  We don't have all the time in the world.  We don't have all the people we need.  We don't know everything...
 We always need to do more, with less.

Francis Galton
 He was a knight!  He visited a livestock fair in 1906.  An Ox was on display.  800 people tried to guess "How much does the Ox
weigh?" No one could. Not even the experts.  But, the mean of the guesses was correct.  Sir Francis Galton discovered the wisdom of the
crowd.

 "Crowdsourcing America's cybersecurity is an idea so crazy it might just work."

Did I say that?
 There is no need to chase the expert.  The right information needs to be delivered to the right people
in the right place, at the right time, and in the right way.  Information aggregation functionality is needed.

What can you do?
 Short-term:
 Identify data security processes that depends on context and business knowledge, such as: Data ownership, Data classification and Access policies.
 Add business users to these processes.  Discover ways to help business and facilitate win/win.
 Medium-long term:
 Make the users your first line of defense.  Gather data security and security education into a single channel.  Reward users for taking an active role, make them your heroes.
