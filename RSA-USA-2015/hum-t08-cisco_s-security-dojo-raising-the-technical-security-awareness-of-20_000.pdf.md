Would you believe we reached 20K people with...
 A four person core team?
 A budget of less than 50K?
 A program created in 6.5 months?
 A non-mandatory program?

The Problem Space (2012)

#RSAC

· Cisco does not have a comprehensive, end-to-end security training program for Engineering
· Current security IQ is inconsistent with Cisco's desire to be industry leaders in secure product development
· Many engineers do not know how to use CSDL to prevent product security flaws
· Engineers are not aware of how threats continue to increase, both in complexity and depth, and apply to their products

#RSAC
Most employees view training as medicine or worse, as punishment.

Level 3 Behavior Change: So What?
Behavior
Plan and allocate sufficient time for the required CSDL mandated activities Instill a Hacker Mindset in your team's approach to development & testing. Ensure team's knowledge of attack mechanisms in topics relevant work. Execute the mandated CSDL elements in the CPDM Lifecycle in your projects? Ensure that team has "Built security in from the start". Team implements Attack Tools during the development, testing and/or deployment processes Ensure that Threat Modeling takes place Ensure that PSB Gap Analysis takes place? Ensure that team acts in a way that protects Cisco from Social Engineering attacks? Ensure registering Third Party components in IP Central Average

Secrets of Success

#RSAC
Secret of Success #1: 20 Minute Modules  Keep each module to 20 minute maximum, but 10
is even better.
 Application: Edit and reduce the required content, and ensure your production team understands the time constraints and keeps you honest!

#RSAC
Secret of Success #2: Subject Matter Expertise  Collaborative pool of subject matter experts ­
include them in content creation & recording
 Application: Start with a small pilot and invite well known security people from your organization to partner in creating a module

#RSAC
Secret of Success #3: Recognition  The 3 R's: Recognition, Recognition, Recognition
 Application: Analyze your organization and create a recognition program using all your available corporate assets

#RSAC
Secret of Success #4: Gone Viral  Viral nature of training
 Application: Build recognition processes to encourage your program to go viral; communicate with each manager when a team member earns a belt.

Secret of Success #5: Hire Instructional Design #RSAC Help  Test questions are HARD to write
 Application: Use expert, Instructional Designers for creation of assessments

#RSAC
Secret of Success #6: Competition  Built in competition amongst teams and Exec's
 Application: Exec's are competitive; build a dashboard that publicizes the statistics of each exec (number of belts, percentage).

#RSAC
Secret of Success #7: Break All the Rules
 Did not know the rules of classical learning & development, so we didn't follow them
 Application: Avoid "we always do training this way", or "this is how the experts say to do it". Be creative and have fun. If you are having fun delivering, people will enjoy consuming.

#RSAC
Secret of Success #8: Creative People  Creative video team (Cisco TV) that "gets" our
concept and helps us to capture it
 Application: Partner with creative people that understand your vision and will help you to reach it

#RSAC
Secret of Success #9: Executive Buy-In  Senior Executive buy-in
 Application: Pilot first, build momentum, and then ask for the world

#RSAC
Secret of Success #10: Gamification  The interface is setup like a game, allowing
learners to achieve and receive visual feedback.
 Application: Realize the importance to current generation of learners, be creative, make an interface that you would like to use
