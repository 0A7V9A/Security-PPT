When I Say Quantitative...
 There is no such thing as a risk; there are scenarios with associated amounts of risk.
 risk : dollars :: weight : pounds :: distance : miles  Expressed in ranges with varying levels of confidence  "The probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss,"
or "how many times over the next year is this bad thing likely to happen, and how much is it likely to cost us each time it does."  Likelihood x impact = risk is not quantitative risk analysis

#RSAC
What Quantitative ERM Does
 Provide, in as close to real-time as possible, high-quality, evidence-based, and actionable information on risks facing the Company
 Estimates of future losses  What can we influence and what can we not ­ what lever to pull  Regular monitoring of key risk indicators  Alerts of failed control testing results

#RSAC
Risk Identification
 What business processes do you execute?  What is the successful outcome of each process?  How does each process work, step by step?  What vendors or information assets, if any, support this process?  What sensitive information is handled in this process?
Failure to respond to FHA "binder requests" in a timely manner.

Risk Analysis
 FAIR Framework  How many times over the next year is this likely to happen?  How much might it cost us each time?  Gather estimates and run Monte Carlo simulations
 Palisades' @Risk, OpenPERT, FairIQ

#RSAC

Context-Specific Question
Over the next year, how many FHA or VA binder requests do you expect Quicken Loans will receive?
Over the next year, what percentage of binder requests do you estimate will not be fulfilled within ten days of receiving the request?
Given the current percentage of binder requests that are not fulfilled on time, what is the likelihood of FHA removing our ability to insure our loans using their automated systems?
If FHA were to remove our ability to insure our loans using their automated systems, how much loss would we expect over the next year from having to pay team members to manually execute this process?

Risk Evaluation/Treatment
 Is this too much risk to accept from this scenario?  What could we do to reduce exposure, and by how much?  Business compares current and future-state risk results  Document accept/remediate decision
 If any remediation is warranted, track action items to completion

#RSAC
Ongoing Monitoring
 Framing a scenario with FAIR makes monitoring easier  Key Risk Indicators
 # of binder requests fulfilled late in last quarter  Binder requests received / number of team members
 Key Controls
 Verify that all requests were immediately logged  Verify that aging reports are accurate

Why haven't more organizations bought Cyber Liability?:
 They have "unbreakable" security controls?  They think the coverage won't last or respond?  They don't believe its a good spend of budget?  They are not aware of the market?  Something else?  Perhaps, organizations don't truly understand

Cyber Insurance Marketplace

#RSAC

· Annual premium volume information about the U.S. Cyber Risk market is hard to come by,
­ Estimated annual gross written premium is in the $2 Billion range (up from $1.3 Billion in last year`s report).
­ Betterly Report June 2014
· 40+ Carriers have a stand alone Cyber Liability Product
­ Many, many more with packaged policy or excess
· Commonly called the next EPLI

· Back up procedures for 1st party cover
· History of prior incidents

Cyber Liability Underwriting

#RSAC

· Underwriting is far from a science

· Most underwriters are not security experts

· Typically written applications

· Model encourages less information not more

· Minimal security controls required are... LOW

· Typically no scans or audits performed

Cyber Liability Underwriting

#RSAC

· Executives understand risk:
­ Avoid, Mitigate, Accept and Transfer
· Organizations understand the need to protect their most important assets and transfer risk already:
­ Property (Buildings) ­ Casualty Coverage (Accidents) ­ Employment Practices Liability & Workers Comp
(People) ­ Professional Liability - Errors and Omissions
· Speak to executives in terms they understand

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Lets estimate costs for a security program for a small business (Approximately $2-5M revenue)
­ Security Staff ­ Security Software / Hardware
· Antivirus, Encryption, Firewall, IDS, DLP, Compliance, Scanners, etc.
­ Security Consulting · External Vuln Scans, Pen Tests, PCI compliance, Legal, Awareness, etc.

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· For sake of argument............
· Lets say it costs a business with $2-5M in revenues spends approximately $100,000/per year on security
· Not including initial investment costs
· This estimate is extremely low if they are to implement proper security
· Should they be spending more? Certain %?
· Does this ensure that they won't have a breach?

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Typical costs for Cyber Insurance are currently extremely reasonable
· Minimum premiums can be $1,500 for $1M in coverage
· Includes many Risk Management Services
· Pricing can change based on industry and controls
· Many smaller companies confused by security and are not yet doing anything

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Larger organizations can also get Cyber Insurance for a reasonable cost
· Large hospital with $2B in revenues premium estimates:
­ $100,000 for $1M in coverage ­ $200,000 for $5M in coverage
· Can build towers with Limits are available up to $250M
· Pricing can change based on industry & controls
· Larger organizations have not shown much interest thus far in actually using Risk Management Services

Despite the limitations, there is real value found in
these policies.

Could insurance force uniform standards and increase security for all?

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Effective security programs cost $$$

· Yet, can still be compromised

· Cyber Liability cheaper than most controls and provides serious financial coverage including security services

· While there are "gotchas", there are legit policies out there

· If you are a CISO and you have a breach. What do you want to say?

­ Whoops? Sorry. ­ We are covered. Lets file a claim.

Incident Response

#RSAC

· Clear need for all organizations to develop an incident response plan
· Develop the plan prior to having a need to use it!
· Incident / breach response partners have value:
­ Included with Cyber Insurance

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Recommended Actions: ­Continue to invest in the appropriate security controls ­Define a response plan in case of a data breach ­Understand your exposures ­Understand your data and number of records

Integrating Insurance

#RSAC

· Recommended Actions (cont):
­ Discuss transferring a portion of risk in the form of Cyber Liability insurance with management
­ Determine coverage that would be important to your organization
­ Determine amount of desired coverage ­ Obtain a Cyber Liability quote ­ If appropriate, integrate Cyber Liability into your risk
management plan

Analysis vs. Intelligence

#RSAC

 Analysis  Looking at past or on going incidents to understand how adversaries are performing their attacks by observing the aftermath of the attack  Looking at sensor data \ forensic to identify attacks with known patterns  Looking at sensor data \ forensic to identify attacks with previously unknown patterns
 Intelligence  Observing the behaviors, actions, or communication of attackers as attacks are being contemplated, planned, organized, or executed  Projecting or Predicting adversary intentions, capabilities, and motivations along with the confidence level of those projections
 In the Information Security field we have merged these into "Cyber Threat Intelligence" for the working vocabulary, but recognize this imprecise  Most of the commercial world is "analysis" with a limited amount of "Intelligence"
98

#RSAC
What do I want vs. What do I have...
 What do I want to know?  On April 30th at 11:00 UTC we will see 10Gbps/Sec of TCP Traffic mainsite.company.com which will last for 73 Minutes  The attacker is EvilBob aka John Doe who lives in Anytown, FL  He is upset we canceled his favorite TV show CSI Cyber  EvilBob controls 3 known BotNets he runs for a Pharma Spam ring based in Mexico. Attached is a list of all the known Command & Control nodes and the encryption key to the C2 traffic.  In the User Agent of the DoS tool, EvilDoS, there is a unique string of "EVIL-BOB-WANTS-HIS-CSI-CYBER"  Our DDoS mitigation provider can filter any traffic above 1Mbps from the attached sources or with the UA string  EvilBob rents his malware from VendorBob on the darknet forum Hire-a-Bob.nu and he paid $999/mo per BotNet selecting the 2 hour SLA for support
 What do I have?  Our current web site traffic is1 Gbps and our max capacity is 3 Gbps.  We see 1,000 sessions with unusual user agent strings that don't map to known browsers or search engines every month  We are running Apache 2.4.10 which is vulnerable to CVE-2014-3583, but we are upgrading on 3-May-15

How to Start
 Get data mainly about observables, indicators, and exploits
 When you have `stuff' to look for you will learn a lot about what you can see and what you can't see. This alone is helpful
 Figure out what kinds of data you can use and what you can't
 Plan projects over time to add capabilities to address observable types you can not search for in your environment.
 For me the first huge gap was windows workstation file names/hashes
 Build efficiencies where ever possible
 Standardize, Consolidate, and de-duplicate
 Make friends
 Join community groups like ISACs, RSA Birds of a feather, etc

#RSAC
Getting to the next level
 Keep Score  Track wins and losses using a model like Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain to know where controls work and fail  Track not just the incidents, but the attempts.  Organizing around Campaigns is a great consolidation point
 Give Back  Set a goal to share one item a week back to your community, even if it is just sighting information at first.  Ramp this up over time
 Develop analytic methods based not on keywords, but patterns

Evolution of Cyber Security Defense

Yesterday's Security

Present Day Problem

Future Solution

? ?

?

? ??

Network Awareness
Protect the perimeter and patch the holes to keep out threats share knowledge internally.
Increasing Cyber Risks
· Malicious actors have become much more sophisticated & money driven.
· Losses to US companies now in the tens of millions; WW hundreds of millions.
· Cyber Risks are now ranked #3 overall corporate risk on Lloyd's 2013 Risk Index.

Intelligence Sharing
Identify and track threats, incorporate knowledge and share what you know
manually to trusted others.

Situational Awareness
Automate sharing ­ develop clearer picture from all observers' input and pro-actively mitigate.

Manually Sharing Ineffective
· Time consuming and ineffective in raising the costs to the attackers.
· Not all cyber intelligence is processed; probably less than 2% overall = high risk.
· No way to enforce cyber intelligence sharing policy = non-compliance.

Crowd Sourcing to solve the
Problem
· Security standards are maturing · ISAC's have become the trusted model
for sharing industry threat intelligence. · Use of automation is revolutionizing
sharing and utilization of threat intelligence.
