Objective 1:
Evolve the Texas Cybersecurity Framework to establish adaptable state policy, standards and guidelines that define appropriate levels of security and risk management for agencies and institutions of higher education.

DIR DESCRIPTION

KEYWORDS

0 There is no evidence of the organization meeting the objective.

None, Nonexistent

1 The organization has an ad hoc, inconsistent, or reactive approach to meeting the objective.

Ad-hoc, Initial

2 The organization has a consistent overall approach to meeting the objective, but it is still Managed,

mostly reactive and undocumented. The organization does not routinely measure or Consistent,

enforce policy compliance.

Repeatable

3 The organization has a documented, detailed approach to meeting the objective, and Compliant, Defined regularly measures its compliance.

4 The organization uses an established risk management framework to measure and evaluate risk and integrate improvements beyond the requirements of applicable regulations.

Risk-Based, Managed

5 The organization has refined its standards and practices focusing on ways to improve its Efficient, Optimized,

capabilities in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

Economized

Phased approach

 Legacy TAC 202 controls move into the Security Control Standards as "Phase 1" controls

 Other NIST controls will be prioritized for implementation 1 year or 2 years out
 Phase 2 = Low/P1 controls NOT in current TAC  Phase 3 = Low/P2&P3 controls NOT in current TAC

March 2015
Controls in Legacy TAC

March 2016
Low / P1 Controls not in Legacy TAC

March 2017
Low / P2 & P3 Controls not in Legacy TAC

#RSAC
State of Texas Governance Timeline
 Updates to the Control Catalog can be based on

Instrumenting the Framework
Objective 2 - Instrument the Texas Cybersecurity Framework within the GRC platform
· Enable the Agency Security Plan process · Define Program Maturity Risk Assessment Methodology
Objective 3 - Support Agency Risk Management Processes · Provide enterprise risk management capabilities within the GRC platform

Business continuity/ disaster recovery (future)

Recover

Protect Risk assessment

Urgent incidents (Live)

Respond

Monthly incident reports (Live)

Detect

SOC alerting (Live) Threat (future)

Incident Response
Issues  No analytics capability for critical
incidents
 Inconsistent reporting from agencies

#RSAC
Solution
 Urgent incidents must be reported through the GRC Incidents module
 Using the GRC platform as your incident response system will automatically generate your required monthly report
 Monthly report uses Veris framework for standardized reporting

#RSAC
Urgent Incident Reporting System
· Incident General Information · Threat Actors/Actions · Indicators of Compromise · Security Attributes · Response · Impact Assessment

Security Plan Template
Issues  Both plan formulation and
analytics difficult using Excel spreadsheets
 Inaccurate responses received because of overriding Excel input
 Inconsistent reporting from agencies

#RSAC
Solution
 Plan reporting must be done using GRC platform
 Analytics and charts are easily generated  Future versions will include program
maturity determination through risk assessment process  All tied together by NIST 800-53

25

#RSAC
Security Plan Template: Excel Version

Security Plan Template in GRC Platform
27

Risk Assessment
Issues  Outdated MS Access system
 Mainly Excel spreadsheets
 No way to roll up overall risk for an organization

#RSAC
Solution
 Risk assessment capability through the GRC platform
 Targeted questionnaires to the people who know the status of controls
 Can roll up to the overall organization  Questions linked to different authoritative
sources

28

Risk Assessable Units

Break assessments down by component so questions are only answered once.
