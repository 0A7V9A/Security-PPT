Background and Introduction ­ Service Desk Manager
Who I Am and What Do I Do
 Who I am? · Kirk Hanson, Manager Service Desk ­ production support, customer facing applications
 What do I do?
 Oversee 250 support engineers, 200 L1, 50 L2, L3 part of the Digital Retail Application team.
 Constantly finding ways to improve efficiency, reduce the need to involve L3 engineers  Become more proactive, reduce detect issues before customers call  Provide metrics and trends to the business and IT department  Reduce MTTR, improve SLA's
 Challenges?
 Tickets not assigned to the right support team  Still too reactive: customers find out about application issues before we do  Too many hours spent in War rooms to detect root cause, high cost of support service

Background and Introduction ­ NOC Manager
Who I Am and What Do I Do
 Who I am? · Emily Duncan, NOC manager, infrastructure and applications
 What do I do?
 Manage 30 Engineers in 3 shifts, initial triage of P1 and P2 issues  Trying to handle as many alerts as possible with the team I have  Responsible for day to day escalations, trying to reduce them  My teams have `eyes on glass' which consists of 6 different monitors, each one showing a
different type of alerts (SCOM, Solarwinds, Nagios)
 Challenges?
 Constantly navigating in a sea of red alerts, very reactive, and difficult to prioritize work  We have 20+ different tools to monitor the infrastructure, issues are very difficult to triage,
no end to end view of the environment and applications  War rooms are like throwing spitballs at each other  Reduce churn in staff

 What do I do?
 Manage 156 developers, also act as L3 support when needed  Transitioning to Agile methodology  Migrating legacy components to the cloud and containerized technology  Constantly striving to increase customer satisfaction, reduce MTTR and increase MTBF  Provide key statistics to the business
 Challenges?
 Too many tools, but no complete visibility of the application end-to-end  Still too reactive: customers find out about application issues before we do  Too many hours spent by my developers to help in troubleshooting when outages occur, too
long to get to root cause  Current tools do not fully support the new technologies we are moving to

MTTI
Mean Time to Innocence
 Everyone is right  Everyone else is wrong  Blame game  Lack of continuity

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

What MTTI Looks Like to SD Personal
Why Does Mean Time to Innocence Matter to the Service Desk
 Low CSAT · Customers are unhappy with our service
 Low NPS
 Low Productivity · It takes too many sets of eyes to find and
resolve issues
 Low Morale · People are burnt out and feel they can't ever get
ahead of the storm
 Turnover Rate Increase
 Lower Customer Retention · There are too many competitor options for
customers so if we disappoint them there's a line around the corner waiting to take our place

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

What MTTI Looks Like to NOC manager
Why does Mean Time to Innocence Matter to the NOC
 Everything is a P1
· Severity doesn't matter, we still have to address it
no matter what
 Everything is Down
· If there is an alert showing on a screen, we have
to look at it even if in the end we find out it's not actionable or it's been resolved
 Services are Down
· We don't know what's impacted or more
importantly WHO'S impacted
 Sea of Red
· Red is always what we see first and there is so
much `RED' it makes it impossible to look at anything else

What MTTI Looks Like to an Application Owner
Why Does Mean Time to Innocence Matter to the Application Teams?
 Is it my application causing the issue?
 Less time to spend actually `Developing Apps' ­
too much time spent `Supporting/Fixing Apps'
 Is my Application playing nice in the production environment?
 App reputation is low means App Developer reputation is low
 Loss of revenue  Loss of customers

create alerts based on things I know go red when something is bad)

Alert me in advance if a
service is declining so I can fix things before
there's widespread impact

Free Splunk led enablement opportunities

Blueprint for Success
What do we need to do? What do we do first, second, last? How long will it take me?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Blueprint for Success
In order to know where you are going, you first have to know where you've been!
1. Identify where you are in the ITOA Maturity Curve · What is being monitored and by what? · Where are the gaps, what can't you do because of the way you are doing things now? · Identify what data sources you need to have that `Single Pane of Glass' · Talk to the people who use these alerts to do their job and find out what their looking at
(alerts, logs, etc.)
2. Prioritize · Pick a Business Critical service · Identify the data sources monitoring that service · Identify `Who' looks at that data to do their job (this will help you build out what components
that service is dependent on)
3. Correlate on what makes sense · ML can you far BUT you need to talk to the SME's who use this data on a regular basis,
understand what they use it for, how they use it, what matters and what doesn't.

Blueprint for Success
In order to know where you are going, you first have to know where you've been!
1. Identify important metrics · What do you measure or look at to know if something is performing well or badly (THIS IS A
KPI)
2. Identify sources of enrichment · CMDB, architecture diagrams, Event Information (Yes you can even help build a service by
the information in an event ­ hostnames, event messages, fields)
3. Validate your work · Look at the way events are being grouped (Episodes) and ask the SME's if it makes sense · Ask the SME's what is missing, what other information do they need to see to get 80% of the
way to know how to resolve the Incident
