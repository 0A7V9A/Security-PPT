Why We Need to Monitor?
 5-10 Years ago there were security concerns with "shared infrastructure"
 Now, securing and monitoring cloud is part of everyday business
 Companies are migrating mission critical applications and workloads
 Analyze security risk, resource usage, performance
 Make decisions across multiple accounts in different regions
 Billing and Cost Control

AWS Inputs
 Getting AWS logs into Splunk can be confusing  There are different methods for each sourcetype  Best Practice is to use SQS-Based S3  High scale, stateless, near real-time processing:
Splunk Add-On for AWS

AWS Service

S3 Bucket

SQS Queue

CloudTrail ­ AWS Setup
Let's work backwards: 1. Create Dead-letter queue THEN regular SQS queue
· Regular queue needs visibility timeout of 5+ mins · Under redrive policy, set max receives to 1 2. Create new CloudTrail (or enable existing one) · Write to S3 bucket 3. Update SQS queue to allow S3 bucket notifications 4. Update S3 events to send notifications to SQS ­ ObjectCreate(all)

Use Cases

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Retailer Enables Realtime VPC Monitoring
 Consumer retailer with 150+ stores  Lines of business through mobile apps and .COM website  Customer had issues monitoring when cloud credit card processor is down  Potential Security Threat? Network Issue?  $$$ Expensive ­ Root cause analysis took days to complete, security team,
network team, incident management was involved
Solutions:  Using VPC Flow to track (in real-time) the network links and application health  Isolate the root cause quickly using saved searches and dashboads

Cost Savings ­ Gaming Company
 Highly anticipated game launch, blockbuster title  All the back-end servers run in AWS across all regions  Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) ran out of "reserved instances"
Solutions:  Use predictive forecasting  Setup alerts in budget planner  Reserved Pricing vs. On Demand
