Supply and Demand
Expectation versus Reality

History
In the beginning
 Splunk Cloud was originally purchased as a SIEM.
 Modest infrastructure, small footprint
 Very little time spent on administration
 Several small scale efforts at optimization

Sudden Demand Static Supply
Spinning plates

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 To drive adoption of the platform and increase security visibility an effort was made to demonstrate its capabilities to various operations groups.

 Selling the value proposition of Splunk internally was really successful · This is a good thing · The platform has enormous potential to benefit the company · This is also a bad thing · The team was still the same size (1)

The Problem
In the beginning
 Surge in demand stressed capacity in three key areas
 Static team size (1)
 Difficult to locate talent for temporary capacity
 No clear strategic solution

 Platform Support
· The larger and more
successful your deployment the more of this there is to do.

Three Legged Stool
Where does all the time go?

 Data Onboarding
· Some data is well
structured. Some data is easily portable. Some is neither.

 Content Creation
· This is occasionally where
a user's story starts, but sometimes the page is left intentionally blank.

There are two fundamentally important components missing from the above, but these you will hardly notice when your deployment is living hand to mouth. You will notice them however when your deployment goes catastrophically wrong.

Platform Support
A stable service for all your users' various needs
 Splunk is only the first technology in your stack  As requirements (and technologies) get added to
the infrastructure the skills required to keep it operating get more advanced  A partial list of technologies we maintain to keep the data flowing and support development · rsyslog · HA Proxy · Docker · Python, Bash, and PowerShell Scripts · Gitlab · Atlassian Stuff · Puppet · PagerDuty

Data Onboarding
"standard syslog"
 Complexity is highly variable. · Sometimes you just push out a TA
directly from Splunk Base and it works
· Sometimes you have to cook up a TA
yourself. Almost anyone can be trained in a day to do the former, far fewer can be handed the specification for an obscure log type and turn it around into a custom TA

Content Creation
After years of gathering first hand anecdotal data While some users became skilled content creators, most new demand fell into two categories

 Demand of the 1st Type · Phase One: "We should get the data into
Splunk"
· Phase Two: ???? · Phase Three: Insight!

 Demand of the 2nd Type
· " I need a dashboard that monitors all
hardware and application errors everywhere in real time."

Both cases require two very different approaches and require a deep understanding of the potential that Splunk has as well as key architectural considerations that can impact:
· License Utilization · Search Performance · Availability

The Anna Karenina Principle
Few right ways and many wrong ways to manage demand

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Everyone basically has access to everything Backend supported as a best effort.
· The first approach we tried was also the
easiest to implement.
- On the plus side, users had ready access to the platform.
- All operations were single threaded through one person.
- Lifestyle that was supported by high interest technical debt.

Bolster the ranks with occasion professional services. Pay down the principle on some of the debt.
· The second approach was better
resourced but not scalable or sustainable
- Operations were no longer single threaded but with additional overhead
- Best practice is a moving target when resources going through a revolving door.

Moment of Truth
From the smoldering ashes of a search head and some heavy forwarders
· What it was that we need to be
successful and stay that way
· Near total neglect of user enablement
and product management
· Available talent pool externally was not
very deep, and it would take time to build skills internally
· We needed a strategic approach

Exploring the COE Concept
Early draft to serious proposal
 Began research into staffing models and best practices  Use of Splunk's COE model to design staffing plan  Still unsure how to fill vacant roles adequately

A New Service Offering
Partnering with Accenture to adapt the Splunk COE concept
 Establish Partnership · Viewed as a key step to ensure access to a large pool of talent
 Build a Shared Service · Economies of scale deepen the bench
 Develop Service Strategy · How would the service be developed and deployed

Delivery Service
On the factory floor
At its most basic, the structure was developed to provide a scalable service for supporting the key components of the platform while freeing up resources internally for program management and user enablement.

Scalable Delivery Service
On the factory floor
 The service scales by offering a baseline capacity with the option of including additional burst capacity
 Resources in reserve are periodically cycled through to shadow dedicated resources so that less time is lost in spinning up additional lines.

Program Management
Deputize your way to success
 Different areas of the organization have wildly different means of measuring value and setting priorities
 The relationship between the value of a byte and the cost to index is a complex problem.
 How can demand be prioritized and value be calculated? · Functional experts in different areas handle
demand from similar groups in the organization
· COE reconciles priorities between different
groups and their own estimations of effort and feasibility

Tooling & Training
Helping users to ask for and receive help
 Making it easy for users to raise demand  Delivery tracking  User education

Access & Availability
Gatekeeping
 The first generation of project management tooling we used was email and shouting over the phone.
 For the COE, more organization was required.

User Enablement
Helping users help themselves help us
 Many users want to create for themselves.
 This sort of self service delivery is in turn monitored by the COE.
 This model allows users to learn the platform and develop their skills while also making efficient use of the COE.

Key Takeaways
What we Learned

1. To be successful you need a deliberate
and well resourced operation
2. Talent can take time to build. In the
meantime partnering made scaling more immediate and sustainable.
3. Supporting the COE with processes and
tooling enables them to be effective.
