Observed View

Journeys are only captured from actor experience.

Not all unique journeys are understood.

Fact Driven View

Rich data granularity and unknowns are known.

Confidential and Proprietary. For Internal Use Only. Do Not Distribute

Deep understanding can be leveraged to begin to model the journey for simulation.

Home Loan Application Use Cases

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

As a Home Loan Product Owner, I want to understand what is happening in the process so that I can understand where the problems lie (e.g. Technology, Process, People), and benchmark what a good journey is. As a Home Loan Product Owner, now I know what the problems are, I want to implement changes to test improvements, as well as real time alerting, so that I can uplift customer/employee experience and revenue.

Stitching and Correlation

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

· Correlation of data across multiple systems is complex · Identifiers for transactions, orders, customers, etc. often differ between
systems within a single transaction · Secondary data sources are required to join the related events (separate to
event data sources)

Customer Journey Maturity

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Customer journeys as a concept have grown from a linear representation of a customer's process to a probabilistic understanding of pathways, overlaid with experiential and quantitative metrics.
As a result, we can optimize and improve experiences on the fly.
