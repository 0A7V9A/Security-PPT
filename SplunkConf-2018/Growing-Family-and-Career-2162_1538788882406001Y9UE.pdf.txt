Growing a Family AND Your Career
With a Little Help From Technology
Do working parents have an advantage over their coworkers by being trained to multitask and be more productive?

Ah, Careers ...
You've worked for years. Everything is going to plan ...

The Four Stages
Denial, Acceptance, Panic, Excitement ... oh, there's Panic again

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The Four Stages of How Am I Going to Rock This?!?
· Step 1: Work-focused Logistical Freak-out Phase
· Immediately fast forward to the month(s) immediately affected by the new addition and begin internally
bargaining solutions for success around any obstacles.
· Step 2: Home/Life Logistical Freak-out Phase
· These two phases usually overlap. Time off plans? Childcare? Parenting skills panic? This phase
really has it all.
· Step 3: Create Your Action Plan
· This phase is the first glimpse into the advanced multi-tasking skills you're already putting into action.
Not only are you continuing to do your work but you're planning as needed for what's to come.
· Step 4: Execute Action Plan / PIVOT!!
· Life has a funny way of throwing your plans out the window.

Now Let's Talk About The Benefits.

 Multi-tasking
· This is a no-brainer. In whatever time you took off of work you honed this skill
to perfection. That isn't to say this isn't going to be a challenge, but it will help you with your ...
 Prioritization skills: the ability to easily identify what's most important
· You're going to have more to do, regardless of what role you play in the
family. This translates into sharpening this skill for your work priorities as well. Even with multi-tasking, you can't do everything. You're going to become an expert at identifying what can wait, and what doesn't need to happen at all.
 The ability to ask for help
· This just gets easier ­ and you're going to need it.

Now Let's Talk About The Benefits ­ Continued.

 Better problem solving

· Necessity is the mother of invention. 5 lb. collapsible transformer strollers

weren't invented by non-parents.

Are you a new parent? BUY THIS!

You are only going to get better at

thinking on your feet.

 You might pay closer attention to people's needs
· Babies aren't great at telling you what they need. But sometimes neither are
co-workers and/or employees. Spending 24/7 paying attention to every waking demand of a child, eventually anticipating them even ahead of time, hones this skill for the boardroom as well.
 Saying NO

You're Doing Your Family A Favor In More Ways Than One

Where Technology Comes In
It's not cheating, it's smart.
Time Management
 Divide and Conquer on Steroids · You're now going to have multiple
people/caretakers in the mix. You're going to need a system.
· Seamless systems free up time for YOU
to get back to focusing on what is important when you decide it's important instead of spinning your wheels.

Do what does all this automation get you?

 Time through simplification of repetitive tasks

 Time through having all the data and solutions at your fingertips

first, but I am convinced it all adds up to a productivity boon.

· When you can pull up the right app and answer a
question in seconds, you can get back to doing whatever you need to be doing. Whether that is hanging out with your family or drafting a presentation.
