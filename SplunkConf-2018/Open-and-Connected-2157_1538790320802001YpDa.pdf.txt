The Digital Economy is forcing businesses to transform

Explosion in transaction growth
driven by mobility and the Internet of Things

IT- driven business agility
for delivering service, security, and efficiency

Analytics is moving to real time
to capture new opportunities at the point
of impact

The IBM Z Mainframe has a vital role in the Digital Economy
Mainframes process
30 billion business transactions per day
Mainframes enable
$7.7 trillion in card payments annually
Mainframes run
68 Percent of the world's production
workloads

Digital transformation presents new challenges
1. Velocity of change is increasing and buying power is shifting from IT to the LOB
· IT is held accountable for SLAs at a business application level · Risk of outages increases as the rate of change accelerates and operational complexity increases · New workload volumes such as mobile or API-enabled applications can be unpredictable
2. Growth of hybrid cloud applications is increasing complexity ­ new layers of IT Systems built out on top of previous layers
· The mapping between business applications and mainframe resources are unclear · Silos among people and environments inhibits SLA attainment and increases time to problem
resolution
3. IT Operation environment is increasingly strained
· Organizations face skills issues as they go through a generational shift · Operations teams are asked to reduce cost while maintaining operational integrity in the face of ever
increasing transactional volume

What is IT Operations Analytics?
IT operations analytics is an approach to:
· Collecting IT data from different sources, · Examining that data in a broader context, and · Proactively identifying problems in advance of
their occurrence.

Statement of Direction: Embedding Machine Learning into IBM Z Operations Analytics
... IBM intends to continue enhancing the Problem Insight dashboard available in Z Operations Analytics to help organizations ensure their IT operations meet their business goals ...
... New insights are expected to advance the existing IBM System z Advanced Workload Analysis Reporter (IBM zAware) anomaly detection by leveraging new IBM Machine Learning for z/OS models and problem signatures based on IBM data science and expertise to forecast when system behavior may lead to broader user impacts and system outages.
Users can expect to be alerted to system behavior changes based on historical data trend analysis across multiple subsystems.

IBM Z Operations Analytics Vision Roadmap

Learn "Normal" from history
Use Machine Learning to Leverage
historical normal system behavior to establish baseline

Early Detection of Departure from "Normal"
Use Machine Learning to Detect changes in system behavior together
with predictive analytics to
determine likely outcomes to alert operations for early
intervention
Goal: Eliminate / Reduce Impact
from service disruptions

Deliver Guidance
Use Machine Learning on tribal knowledge together with prescriptive analytics to provide guidance on actions
to take
Goal: provide insight and recommend remediation

Autonomous Operations
Preemptive action on problems
through proven automation
Goal: allow the system to manage its "normal" health
