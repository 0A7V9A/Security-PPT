Why is Diversity Important?

"McKinsey & Company has published reports that show evidence that gender diverse companies are 15% more likely to succeed financially than
gender imbalanced companies, ethnically diverse companies are 35% more likely to succeed."

"The data show how important diversity is to the success of teams and decision making. All of us on the Board got involved in ABI because we see this as vitally important for innovation, for competitiveness and for business success. Advancing women isn't a corporate social responsibility imperative, it's a competitive imperative." ­ Mark Bregman, CTO, Neustar and ABI Board Trustee

Improved Operational and Financial Performance
Increased Innovation
Better Problem Solving and Group
Performance
Enhanced Company Reputation

Women have tremendous purchasing power. Organizations who employ more women in key roles are better equipped to meet the needs of the broader market, because women know what women want.
For many companies, innovation is a strategic imperative. Research shows that women bring valuable perspectives and approaches to the ideation process, resulting in more innovative solutions to complex problems.
Knowledge work is performed in teams. Studies show that diverse groups solve problems more effectively than homogenous ones, raising overall performance and giving teams that include women a distinct competitive edge.
Demand for technical talent is fierce. Companies who develop women in roles at every level are able to attract more qualified applicants, sending positive signals to the labor market and improving their reputation
