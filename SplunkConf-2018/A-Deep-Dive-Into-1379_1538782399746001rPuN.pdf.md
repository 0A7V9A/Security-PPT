Problems

LDAP component slowness
 ~4s login time on average

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 ~17s login + page load

Active Directory (AD) server load

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Splunk instance does the most queries and 98% of the big queries

Slow auth config deployment
~1 hour deployment time

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Auth config bundle deployment failures
1/4 of our bundle deployment failed

Questions to answer
 Why is LDAP component (e.g. login) slow? · What LDAP queries does Splunk perform? · Why are they slow? · Why are they resource heavy?
 Why is bundle deployment slow and error-prone? · What does bundle deployment do? · Which part of the bundle deployment is slow?

Investigation

What LDAP queries are being done?
 ScopedLDAPConnection = DEBUG · 400k LDAP searches in 15 minute!

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

What is querying LDAP?
 Components that queries LDAP · 1 User login = 300+ LDAP searches · Any components that need user roles: · Search scheduler · Search dispatcher · Data model ·...

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Why are queries expensive?

 Two key factors: · The number of LDAP groups · Depth of LDAP group nesting

E.g. a troublesome group:
 atlassian-staff: · member_groups (55): · exec-team
- Scott - Mike -...
· sydney-staff
- observability-team -...
· mountain-view-staff · customer-support
- amsterdam-support -...
·...

Recap
 LDAP component slowness · Splunk needs to query a big tree of LDAP groups for each user.

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 AD server load · Compounding the problem above, a lot of components in Splunk also need to query user
info.
 Slow bundle deployment · Bundle installation includes reloading authentication information for everyone twice.

 userLogin · Can be a basic LDAP bind

Username + Password True / False

 getUserInfo · Determines ACL · Gets called frequently and concurrently · Unrealistic to do LDAP query

Script Functions

 getUsers · Roles are not used for ACL (7.0.4) · Determines if schedule search gets run

Lessons

Key Takeaways
LDAP auth

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
1. Nested LDAP structure and the number
of groups can negatively affect performance
2. Use ScopedLDAPConnection to profile
your LDAP queries
3. Beware of auth reloads when deploying
authorize.conf and authentication.conf via bundle

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Key Takeaways
Splunk Debuging

1. Loggers are great, enable them for
troubleshooting
2. Flamegraph can help with finding
problematic components
3. Access log gives you a glimpse of the
internal workings of Splunk

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Key Takeaways
Scripted Auth

1. Instrument your auth script
2. Ingest script logs back into Splunk for
debugging
3. The script need to be implemented
efficiently
