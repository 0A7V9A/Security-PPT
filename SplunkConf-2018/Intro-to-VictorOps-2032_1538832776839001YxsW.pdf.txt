Tooling & System Changes

via migration to cloud infrastructure & breaking up the monolith with a microservices approach
2. Invest in CI/CD and Automation to
increase release cadence
3. Instrument monitoring for the new
stack
4. Modernize Incident Management

Comparison: Traditional Slow Response Model

Round-robin response to problems: "because it's your turn!"
Disadvantages:  First responder probably can't solve the problem  So, they `guess' who the correct responder is and
escalate to that person  This assumption is often incorrect, increasing
MTTA/MTTR
Result:
A problem that happens at night takes all night to solve.

Critical Application Alert Stream
On-Call Rotation

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Comparison: VictorOps Fast Response Model

Vectored response to problems: "because you can fix it!"
Advantages:  Considerably reduce load on individual team members  Incidents are more actionable to the recipient  Remediation information is provided to solve the problem
more quickly  Small fraction of problems fall through to the general on-call
rotation, thus significantly improving quality of life!
Result:
Problems fixed fast, and everyone and the company are happier.
