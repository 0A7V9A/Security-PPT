Assumption #2
General understanding of Splunk infrastructure
Search Heads Query information across indexers and are usually CPU and memory intensive.
Indexers Write data to disk and are both CPU and I/O intensive.
Forwarders Collect and forward data; usually lightweight and not resource intensive.

HOT

WARM

COLD

Optional TSIDX Reduction
HOT ­ Newest buckets of data that are still open for write WARM ­ Recent data but closed for writing (read only) COLD ­ Oldest data, commonly on cheaper, slower storage FROZEN ­ No longer searchable, commonly archived or deleted data

FROZEN

Assumption #4
You've heard of Splunk S2 Architecture....

HOT

"Remote_Path"

Optional TSIDX Reduction

HOT ­ Newest buckets of data that are still open for write REMOTE_PATH ­ Data aged from HOT to an S3-compatible object storage platform

Sizing Fundamentals
How many servers do I need?

Reference Minimum  12 cores  12GB RAM  800 IOPS
Search Head  16 cores  12GB RAM  300 IOPS

Machine Requirements

Indexers
Mid-Range  24 cores  64GB RAM  1200 IOPS

High-Performance  48 cores  128GB RAM  SSD

Others
Heavy Forwarder  16 cores  12GB RAM  300 IOPS

Utility  8 cores  8GB RAM  300 IOPS

Dark truth: Choose wisely...or scalability will suffer later.

HOT

WARM

COLD

OR

Optional TSIDX Reduction

HOT ­ can be DAS in server or SAN (Flash is best)

FROZEN

WARM ­ same as Hot

COLD ­ adds option for NAS

FROZEN ­ No longer searchable, so object stores are option here (last resort)

Myth about bucket sizing...
 # of buckets x bucket size  Not days...

indexes.conf # volume definitions
[volume:hotwarm_cold] path = /mnt/fast_disk maxVolumeDataSizeMB = 3984589
# index definition (calculation is based on a single index)
[main] homePath = volume:hotwarm_cold/defaultdb/db coldPath = volume:hotwarm_cold/defaultdb/colddb thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/defaultdb/thaweddb homePath.maxDataSizeMB = 512000 coldPath.maxDataSizeMB = 2560000 maxWarmDBCount = 4294967295 frozenTimePeriodInSecs = 2592000 maxDataSize = auto_high_volume coldToFrozenDir = /mnt/big_disk/defaultdb/frozendb

Indexer Deployment Options

Distributed Deployment

Distributed Deployment Indexer data is stored once and distributed across available indexers
Clustered Deployment A group of indexers are configured to replicate each other's data

Indexer Clustering

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 High Availability for Indexes
 Indexer Clustering Settings · Replication Factor = copies of raw
data
· Search Factor = copies of indexes

SPLUNK INDEXER AVAILABILITY

Multiple copies of index and raw data
· Index  # copies of indexes  Search factor (SF) · Raw Data -> # of of copies of raw data  Replication factor (RF)

Copy 1 500GB

Copy 2 Copy 2 500GB 500GB

Copy 1 500GB

1TB * 60 days x ½ x 2 = 60TB (RF/SF=2) ** doubled **
1TB * 60 days x ½ x 3 = 90TB (RF/SF=3) ** tripled **
STORAGE CAPACITY
MULTIPLIES!

1TB Ingested Data SF=2 / RF=2

Multisite Indexer Clustering

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Protects indexes across disparate locations
 Enables Search Affinity
 Site specific RF/SF settings

 Sizing = each site + site protected

Splunk Sizing Questionnaire

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 What is the licensed daily ingest rate for Splunk (expressed in some amount of GB/Day or TB/day)?  What is the retention period for Hot/Warm and Cold (days kept in each tier)?  Any data being sent to frozen? If so, what is the retention period and requirement for doing so?  Is indexer clustering being leveraged? If so, what are the settings for Replication and Search Factor?  How many indexer and search servers are deployed? Do you have a visualization you can share of
the deployment?  Is Splunk being run as a single site or multiple sites? If multiple, is multi-site clustering being
leveraged?  Is the Enterprise Security App or ITSI for Splunk deployed?

Splunk applications from Dell EMC
Extend the power of Splunk to Dell EMC Platforms

What are Splunk Apps? Splunk applications and add-ons allow user to import data into Splunk from specific sources
Splunk & its partners have created a rich community called SplunkBase that has 1000s+ applications

Dell EMC has apps for the following: - VMAX - XtremIO - Isilon - VNX

Why are Splunk Apps important? Splunk apps and add-ons allow customers to incorporate new use cases and extend their Splunk environment. This leads to increased Splunk License needs as well as additional Hardware
