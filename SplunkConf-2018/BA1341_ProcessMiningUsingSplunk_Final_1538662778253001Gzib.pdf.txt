" Data science is the profession of the future. However, it is not
sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to processes. At the same time, process analysis professionals need to learn how to incorporate data
from the IT systems into their work."
Prof. Wil van der Aalst | http://processminingbook.com/foreword.html
