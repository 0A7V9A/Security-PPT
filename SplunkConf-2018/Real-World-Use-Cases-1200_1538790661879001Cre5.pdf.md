Fraud with Solr, Splunk, and Splunk Analytics for Hadoop

Use Case: Fraud ­ Why Apache Solr?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Solr is an open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene API. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, and real-time indexing.

1. Problem: Scanning a month or more of data while searching for keywords across Hadoop files can be a lengthy process.
2. Goal: Limit the number of files to search and minimize the number of MapReduce jobs to run.
3. Solution: Apache Solr keyword/file index and Splunk Analytics for Hadoop.

Hadoop - Solr

Splunk - Solr

· Solr monitors changes to Hadoop directory/files
· Indexes keywords based on Hadoop files

· Splunk form dashboard · User enters keyword(s) · Python script calls Solr · Solr tells Splunk all
Hadoop files with keywords ·

· Splunk Analytics for Hadoop runs MR jobs with targeted files
· Eliminates massive Hadoop scan

Cybersecurity Posture with Spark and Splunk Federated Search

Cybersecurity Posture ­ Why Spark?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Spark provides APIs that provide very fast, in-memory processing and was developed in response to limitations with the Hadoop MapReduce cluster computing paradigm.

1. Problem: Spark processing does not provide easy analytics or any visualization.
2. Goal: Allow Security Analysts access to multiple Splunk implementations while maintaining Knowledge Object and Access Control.
3. Solution: Spark and Splunk Federated Search.

Business Analytics with Cassandra, Splunk Cloud, Splunk Analytics for Hadoop,
and Rabbit MQ

Business Analytics ­ Why Cassandra?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Cassandra is an open-source distributed NoSQL database system designed to handle large amounts of data across a cluster of commodity servers.

1. Problem: Lack of visibility into customer behavior from mobile applications.
2. Goal: Visualize and analyze all data that is stored in Cassandra.
3. Solution: Store all mobile activity into Cassandra via Rabbit MQ and use Splunk Analytics for Hadoop with Cassandra External Result Provider (ERP) to query that data.

Document Classification with Apache Nifi, Spark Core, Spark Machine Learning, Apache Tika, and Splunk Analytics for Hadoop

Document Classification ­ Why Spark?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Spark provides APIs that provide very fast, in-memory processing and was developed in response to limitations with the Hadoop MapReduce cluster computing paradigm. The main components of Spark are: Core, Spark-SQL, Machine Learning, Stream, and Graph APIs.

1. Problem: Spark processing does not provides easy analytics or any visualization.
2. Goal: Allows analysts and regulators the ability to know exactly where each file exists in the system.
3. Solution: Apache Nifi, Spark Core, Spark Machine Learning, Apache Tika, and Splunk Analytics for Hadoop.

Network IT with Kafka and Splunk Connect for Kafka

Network IT ­ Why Kafka?

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Kafka is a very fast and distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients while indexing.

1. Problem: No unified collection framework.
2. Goal: Real-time visualization and analytics using Splunk, batch visualization and analytics using Hadoop and RDBMS.
3. Solution: Kafka, Hadoop, Splunk Connect for Kafka, Oracle.
