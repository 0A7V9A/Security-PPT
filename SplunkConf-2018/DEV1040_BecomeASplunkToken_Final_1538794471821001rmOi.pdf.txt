Token Mastery Roadmap for Absolute Beginners
 Step 1: Use OOTB (out-of-the-box) Splunk Web event search and report drilldowns  Step 2: Use Simple XML, use the dashboard drilldown editor and predefined tokens  Step 3: Use Simple XML, leverage custom (including auto generated) tokens in forms  Step 4: Use Simple XML, manipulate interactions with JavaScript extensions  Step 5: Insert INLINE HTML into Simple XML and do amazing things with JavaScript
extensions  Step 6: Leave Simple XML and, possibly, leave Splunk Web entirely!!!
и Simple XML converted to HTML code and Splunk Web Framework (JavaScript) extensions и Access Splunk data from your own external web site, using the SplunkJS Stack и Splunk Add-on to Splunk Web и Splunk App for Splunk Web и Splunk App (runs a completely custom GUI, does not run in Splunk Web) и Splunk REST API и Splunk SDKs (JavaScript, Java, Python, C#)

Poll Question

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.

What drilldown options do you have available for a report?

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.
What drilldown options do you have available for a report? Answer: Only 1.
When you click on a report the Splunk Search and Reporting application will open, a new search will be executed, and the new search result will be the original search filtered by whatever selection you made on the report.

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.

REPORT DRILLDOWN DEMO

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Differences Between Reports, Dashboards, and Forms
Report A report is a table or a visualization displaying data returned from a search. You can save a table or a visualization as a report. A report is built using the Splunk Web user interface. It is not editable or customizable, other than the configuration options available in the Splunk Web UI.
Dashboard You can also save a table or visualization as a dashboard panel (an object on a dashboard). A dashboard is editable and customizable using Simple XML, HTML, and SDKs.
Form A special kind of dashboard is a form. The dashboard is transformed into a form when data entry and selection mechanisms are added (i.e., text boxes, dropdown lists, multiselect lists, checkboxes, radio buttons,submit button, etc.).

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Step 2: Dashboards Drilldown Editor,
Predefined Tokens, & Simple XML
Dashboard Interactivity Based on Predefined Tokens

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Once you have saved a table or visualization as a dashboard panel, you can edit it using the Dashboard Drilldown Editor (see the next slide).

Poll Question
When are tokens automatically generated for you?

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.
When are tokens automatically generated for you?
Answer: Form Inputs
When you add a form input to a dashboard, the dashboard is transformed into a form, and
a token is generated automatically

Auto Generated Tokens
Placing a Form Input onto a Dashboard Automatically Generates a Token

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 When you add an input to a form, a token is generated automatically и You can customize the token name
 You have to put the plumbing in, the auto generated token will not do anything without some configuration or editing of the Simple XML by you и The token must be populated with some value that you can then use to perform an action
 Although the token in auto generated for you, it is really just a convenience and is exactly like a custom token и An auto generated token does not automatically do anything

Form Editor Е2018SPLUNKINC.
Form inputs (forms only)
<fieldset> <input>
 <text>  <checkbox>  <dropdown>  <multiselect>  <radio>
<search> (to populate input choices)

Step 4: Simple XML & JavaScript Extensions
Interactivity Based on JavaScript Extensions

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.

JavaScript Extensions
Directory location: Where to place the JavaScript file.

Е 2018 SPLUNK INC.

ALWAYS. ALWAYS. ALWAYS, start the RequireJS block with "splunk/mvc" and end the RequireJS block with "splunk/mvc/simplexml/ready!"

form-multiselect.xml
<input id="multi1" type="multiselect" token="release_year" searchWhenChanged="false"> <valuePrefix>release_year="</valuePrefix> <valueSuffix>"</valueSuffix> <delimiter> OR </delimiter>

var multi1 = mvc.Components.get("multi1") multi1.on("change",function(){
current_val = multi1.val() console.log("Current Vals: " + current_val) var first_choice_value = multi1.options.choices[0].value; if (current_val.length > 1 && current_val.indexOf(first_choice_value) == 0) {
multi1.val(_.without(current_val, first_choice_value));
}
if (current_val.length > 1 && current_val.indexOf(first_choice_value) > 0) { multi1.val([first_choice_value]);

Step 5: Simple XML, INLINE HTML &
JavaScript Extensions
Interactivity based on manipulation of INLINE HTML with JavaScript Extensions

INLINE HTML
Typically, you will insert INLINE HTML inside a Simple XML <row>.
<row> <html> <div id="htmltable">
<table> <tr> <td><img src = " /static/app/is_app_one/graph.png" /></td> <td> <p>Lorem ipsum ...</p> <p>Nulla ut congue ...</p> <p>Etiam pharetra ...</p> </td> </tr>

 Boundary 1: No need for dashboards. и Event searches and reports suffice
 Boundary 2: No need for forms. и Default behaviors of dashboards suffice
 Boundary 3: No need for custom user interfaces. и Default behaviors of forms suffice
 Boundary 4: No need to insert some HTML capabilities not available in Splunk Web. и JavaScript extensions with Simple XML provides adequate user interface customization
 Boundary 5: No need for traditional web development with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript и JavaScript extensions with INLINE HTML does what Simple XML cannot do
