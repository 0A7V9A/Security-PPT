Card Washing is the act of validating a list of credit cards in bulk for later use

What is Card Washing?
And who are we up against?
- Cybercriminals who specialize in payment card fraud either buy or obtain large data sets of credit card data and then attempt to verify the validity of that stolen data using differing techniques with the aim of selling on validated cards at a premium or to use them for fraud in order to monetize.
- These Cybercriminals use a variety of different methods to either compromise or acquire already compromised payment card credentials, including sharing or purchasing dumps online, hacking vulnerable merchant websites and compromising payment card processing devices. The compromised payment card credentials can also be used to generate further card information. The main methods used to launder and monetize illicit funds include online purchases of various goods and services as well as ATM withdrawals.
- It is amazing the extent to which Cybercriminal organisations display characteristics of a sophisticated business operations taking advantage of technology including the scalability and power of cloud computing and the use of automation to create tools to identify vulnerable payment interfaces and perform card washing activities as well as evade detective and preventative anti fraud controls. Such actors use tools commonly known as "card generators" to generate new card numbers based on the compromised ones, creating additional opportunities for monetization.

Problem Scope
How much of a problem is Card Washing?

Card washing is a significant problem
Findings from AusPayNet Australia Payment Card Fraud Report 2018

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 According to the Australian Payment Card Fraud 2018 report released by AusPayNet, Australia's self-regulatory body and industry association for payments:
· Card fraud [in Australia] of all types was up 5% to $561 million and accounted for 0.075% of
the overall value of card transactions. As the overall value of transactions was also up 5% to $748.1 billion, the rate of card fraud remained largely the same as in 2016.
· As in-person fraud becomes harder, and as more payments are made online, fraud is
migrating to card-not-present channels. Almost 85% of card fraud now occurs online, reflecting a global trend of growing online card fraud and cybercrime generally.
· In 2017, online fraud totalled $476.3 million, representing 87.5percent of all fraud on scheme
cards. This compares to 75 percent in 2012

What is the impact?
Who is paying the bill?
· Fraudulent payments directly cost merchants in the form of chargebacks and payment
gateways in the form of refunded transaction fees as well the indirect costs of the time and effort to manage these processes. Given enough volume, the card schemes (Visa/Mastercard) can get directly involved.
· Cardwashing can occur against any unauthenticated payment interfaces, which commonly
exist to allow frictionless payments like donations to charities and other non-profits who need the process to be as easy as possible. Merchant transaction accounts can also be compromised through poor security practices i.e easily guessable passwords and cardwashing activities then occur.
· Overall, fraudulent activity has the potential to damage trust in card schemes and for specific
companies and is not a victimless crime. The costs to manage fraud are borne through higher transaction/processing fees.

Not scalable

Development work
required

Too slow

Manual actions required

Lack of alerting

SecurePay's Solution
What we built to solve those problems
 Identified an opportunity to extend our Web Application Firewall to enforce differing rule sets for differing interfaces
 Categorised and prioritised the payment interfaces and platforms  Important that B2B interfaces saw as little impact as possible  Most of the Card Washing activity occurred on non-authenticated C2B channels  Blocking would be IP address based and only be enforced for a set duration  IP Address blocks would be automatically enforced and automatically lifted  Able to manually lift a block in the event of an incident  Able to whitelist customer IP addresses by mutual agreement  Leverages Splunk for Event logging, analysis, alerting and reporting

The Awesome Features
The best bits!
 No Development work required. Implemented and administered by Cyber Security  Can be load balanced / scaled if required  Does not replace proprietary fraud mitigation offerings  Botnet ready. Attackers can't simply change IP address  Splunk logging & proactive alerting of all IP's suspected of card washing  Designed to support non-blocking / reporting mode  100% automated, no manual intervention required. Blocks are lifted automatically.  Tuneable rules to react to new threats  Self-cleaning local database

Solution Summary
In summary, the new process is:

Just the Beginning
What's Next?
 The Card Washing prevention tool has been a great success to date  Future iterations will likely involve:
· Splunk's Anomaly Detection­ to identify baseline expected transaction volumes per merchant · These statistics can assist in raising alerts for accounts processing outlying volumes of transactions
· Splunk's Predictive Analysis ­ to identify card washing incidents before they get a chance to ramp up in
volume and impact to our customers.
