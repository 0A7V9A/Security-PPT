Splunk Metrics Performance

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Metrics and Events

New, high-speed metrics engine that integrates seamlessly with events

Metrics
 Set of numbers describing a particular process or activity measured over an interval of time -- i.e., time series data
 Virtually unlimited number of use cases

Any metric
(number)

Predictable, homogeneous structure
time

Events
 Traditional Splunk -- typically text, binary, un/structured data that describe a set of discrete events that happen over time
 Virtually unlimited number of use cases
Traditional Splunk

 Common metrics sources:
· System metrics (CPU, memory, disk), sensor data (temperature) · Infrastructure metrics (AWS CloudWatch), web tracking (Google Analytics) · Application agents (application performance monitoring, error tracking)

Sample Metric
1481050800
Timestamp

os.cpu.user

42.12345

hq:us-west-1

Metric name

Value

Dimensions

 Common event sources:

· System and server logs (syslog, journald), APIs (Twitter, Wunderground)

· Firewall data (Palo Alto Networks, etc)

· Application, platform and other logs (log4j, log4net, Apache, MySQL, AWS)

Sample Log

Of course can also contain numbers

Metrics in Splunk Enterprise
Lightning-fast performance when searching on metrics

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Up to 2,000x speed improvement against the same search (query) on logs with Splunk Enterprise 6.6
 All Splunk Platform benefits apply:
· Visualizations and alerting · Role-based access controls · Data onboarding · Clustering, scaling, alerting · Leverage open source for existing source types
(statsd, collectd)

Metrics ­ great for high volume data and large number of searches in one dashboard

Turn Event Data Into Metrics

Turning Events into Metrics
Using the mcollect command

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Which airline has the longest delays into Orlando? 1. Start with a public airline dataset and put into traditional Splunk event index 2. Look at the shape of the data 3. Create a new metrics index 4. Push event data into the metrics index using mcollect command 5. Query the metrics index to find our answer

index=airline_data | stats avg(ArrDelay) as AvgDelay by Dest, Origin, UniqueCarrier | eval _value=AvgDelay | eval metric_name="AvgDelay" | table Dest, Origin, UniqueCarrier, metric_name, _value | mcollect index=airline_metrics_index

| mstats avg(AvgDelay) as AvgDelay WHERE index=airline_metrics_index Dest=MCO Origin=IAD by UniqueCarrier | sort -AvgDelay

Logs to Metrics
