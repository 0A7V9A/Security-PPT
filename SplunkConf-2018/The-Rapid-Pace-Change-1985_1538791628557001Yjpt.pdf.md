Inclusive Excellence

Changing the culture:
· Accommodations (legal change) · Access (legal + behavior/attitude change) · Thriving Organization (legal+ behavior/attitude + culture change)

When everyone thrives, synergies happen; the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts

Accessibility Initiatives at your Organization
 Who is currently responsible for this function in your org?
 Who should be?  What does/should this look like?
 It's not just a "Tech" problem ­ it is a cultural problem.

Design Thinking: 20 is the new 80
 Software development approach 80/20  Making choices to meet budget, goals

 Change approach and start with the foundation (20)
 Synergies in product development, deployment, and overall experience far outweighs the flashy "wants" and "nice to haves" and will make these extras cheaper, easier, and faster to build.

Reactive v. Proactive (welcoming and supportive) Approaches
 Current System: Individuals must request accommodations in advance
· Do not always disclose disability · Who's in this group?
 Opportunities Missed: Supporting Access for All
· Ex: Certain initiatives can benefit all ­ ChatOps, etc.
 Retroactive ideas tend to not be actually inclusive, or miss the mark.

Universal Design: Everyone Benefits

ChatOps as an example of Universal Design
 Unifying Communications between teams ­ regardless of modality
· Full visibility into what is being done and when (and
accessible!)
 Not just emojis (but they don't hurt!)

Zoom as an example of Unintentional Design
 Zoom ­ awesome video platform
· "Feature" ­ zoom highlights the video conference
participant with noise, assuming they are speaking.
 Opportunities Missed: Supporting Access for All
· (make a "turn highlight off" feature please Zoom!)

Legal and fiscal ramifications

 Consumer perception: · Remedial accommodation is costly and resource
intensive.
 Workforce productivity and retention
 Federal and State government investigations and actions
 Private lawsuits
 Damage to "brand" and reputation

Lawsuits and Precedents
· DOJ v. UC-Berkeley (content removal) · NAD v. Netflix · NAD v. MIT

enforcement

 Require VPATs from Vendors when reviewing software or systems for purchase
 Request evidence of studies, research on product development related to accessibility
 Add language to contracts (accessible digital files, transcripts, original/native/unlocked content)

 Has your organization been "served"? Are you at risk?
 Do you know your website/software accessibility status?

Lost In Translation

 Disaster Communications (Interpreters on Screen) ­ Why?
 Captioning Automation (not quite there)
· EX: Training Videos

Accessibility and Web SEO go hand-in-hand
 Search Engine Optimization (SEO)  Web crawlers consume the web in similar fashion as screen
readers.
· Accessible content improve search rankings/results · Captions improve video searchability

Web/Digital Accessibility

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 How centralized is your web presence?
· What should your minimum WCAG 2.0 standard be?
· How pervasive is the use of PDF files? (links to Adobe Reader software required)
 Avoid temptation to convert existing files/publications (enrollment brochures, annual reports) to PDFs
 Pay attention to site navigation (tab order/keyboard navigation)

Accessibility Standards and Guidelines

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) published by the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3c.org)
 Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 508)

 What is the baseline or benchmark for web accessibility?

WCAG 2.0 Principles
 Perceivable  Operable  Understandable  Robust
 12 guidelines

Web/Digital Accessibility Conformance

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 A (Lowest) : visitors will find it impossible to use some pages or functionality. These issues should be fixed as soon as possible and comprehensively.
 AA: visitors will find it difficult to use some pages or functionality. These issues do not need to be fixed right away but should still be addressed as soon as possible.
 AAA (Highest) visitors will find it somewhat difficult to use some pages. These issues do not carry the same urgency as the first two priorities, however we still recommend they are repaired so visitors can engage with your content more successfully
