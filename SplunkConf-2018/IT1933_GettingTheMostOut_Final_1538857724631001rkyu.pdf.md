Infrastructure Monitoring Challenges

Infrastructure monitoring isn't new, but constantly changing demands require a new approach

Monitoring and Troubleshooting
In Silos

Nonstop increase in complexity makes finding and fixing problems harder

Spending too much time administering monitoring software

" Why am I monitoring with one tool and troubleshooting with another? "

" Applications keep getting more complex and I'm required to monitor more than ever and find problems faster! "

" We don't have enough people and budget to buy and maintain complex monitoring tools. "

Monitoring the metrics that are most important to you
Combine metrics and logs into investigations to get a
more complete view of problems and their likely
causes "Splunk Insights for Infrastructure cleverly combines metrics and logging for a
more complete view of infrastructure performance. We can see unusual behavior such as a CPU spike and correlate it with logs to troubleshoot
problems much more quickly." ­ Daryl Robbins, Senior Cloud Architect at Entrust Datacard
