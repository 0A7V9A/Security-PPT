Basic Guidelines of Large Deployments
How Good Architecture helps in easier deployments
1. Understand the use cases and the end goals

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

2. Consider the management aspects of deployments early

3. Embrace relevant product features as soon as you can

4. Spread the search workloads to all indexers evenly

Sample Real World Deployments

Deployment A

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 900 TB ingestion per day  1050 indexers
· 12 core to 24 core CPU, 40 to 60 GB of RAM  Local Disk
· No SSD; Hot / warm / cold on same disk  Total searches executed per day is 25,000

Key Takeaways
· 1 TB / day ingestion per indexer
· Index-heavy, Low-search environment

Deployment B

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 1.5 PETA Byte ingestion per day  3540 indexers
· Xeon E5-2650, 128 GB of RAM  Local Disk
· No SSD; Hot / warm / cold on same disk ; RAID 10  Total searches executed per day is 429,000

Key Takeaways
· Balance of data ingest to search load

Deployment C

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 1.65 PETA Byte ingestion per day  2950 indexers
· Xeon E5-2650, 128 GB of RAM  Local Disk
· No SSD; Hot / warm / cold on same disk ; RAID 10  Total searches executed per day is 325,000

Key Takeaways · Heavy Search environment · Lower ingest per Indexer

Common Deployment Characteristics
What do these large deployments have in common
 High ingest volumes per indexer (400Gb-1Tb/day) · Multiple indexer pipelines · Indexer resources are balanced between ingest and search · Single data volume (no separate Hot and Cold volumes) · No indexer clustering overhead
 Limited number of well known sourcetypes · Correct event parsing rules (date/time, event boundaries)
 Managed search workloads · Monitoring the efficiency of user searches · Scheduled and reporting search reviews (scheduled search efficiency and bloat)

Scaling and Management

Balancing Indexer Resources

IOPS

 Splunk is I/O intensive
 I/O bottlenecks on Indexers are the most common performance issues across Splunk deployments
 Slow storage performance can cause Indexing ingest latency
 Performance of Search processes on the Searchpeers (Indexers) is directly related to accessing data from stored buckets
 Indexing and Search processes can be in contention for I/O resources

Indexing

Balancing Indexer Resources
This is where the subtitle goes

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

IOPS

CPU

RAM

 SSD/Flash storage can provide high I/O performance
 Additional RAM on Linux Servers is utilized by the kernel as disk cache, reducing the number of read requests to the storage subsystem for recently accessed data ­ significantly improving I/O throughput

Workload Management
New in Splunk 7.2
 Provide ability to prioritize resource allocation to critical workloads
 Guaranteed resource allocation for ingestion to avoid data lags
 Pre-allocate CPU and Memory resources

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Deployment Automation
This is where the subtitle goes
 Deployment at scale -> orchestration  Managing hundreds or thousands of Splunk servers
· Managing underlying OS, system patches, system accounts, ulimit settings · Deployment and Upgrades of Splunk · Base and template configuration files · Addition of new servers as your deployment grows to meet demand · Management of forwarders (package and configurations)

Tips and Tricks ­ Forwarder Tier

Importance of Balanced Data Spread
 Overloading of any specific indexers is bad  Well balanced data spread is fundamental to scaling an environment  Sticky forwarders and time based load balancing often lead to issues  EVENT_BREAKER to the rescue !

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

UF Event Breaking

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Added in Splunk 6.5 · Only available on the Universal Forwarder (UF)
 What does it do? · Provides lightweight event breaking on the UF · AutoLB processor now sees event boundaries · Prevents locking onto an Indexer
 How does it work? · Props.conf on UF · Event breaking happens for specified Sourcetypes · Sourcetypes without an event breaker are not processed · Regular AutoLB rules apply

props.conf [sourcetype] EVENT_BREAKER_ENABLE = True EVENT_BREAKER = <regEx>

UF autoLB switching

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 New UF setting in 7.1

outputs.conf

 UF can now switch Indexers based on volume sent to [tcpout:]

autoLBVolume=1048576

Indexers

autoLBFrequency=10

 If the forwarder has sent more than autoLBVolume bytes of data to an indexer, it changes indexers regardless of whether or not autoLBFrequency have passed since the last change to a receiving indexer.
 If the forwarder has not sent more than autoLBVolume bytes of data before autoLBFrequency seconds have elapsed, then it changes indexers after that time has passed.

Tips and Tricks ­ Indexer Tier

Indexer Clustering

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Clustering Benefits · Clustering offers Data Redundancy · Foundation for Search High Availability · Cluster Bundle deployment to maintain configurations across Indexers · Centralized Management of Indexers for cluster restarts
 Clustering Costs · Requires more disk to provide data duplication · Increases network traffic for streaming replication of events and bucket fixup tasks · Additional administration tasks

Indexer Clustering
 Large Cluster Deployment Recommendations (per cluster) · 100 TB/day · 400 indexers · Multi site deployments*
 Bucket count matters · 9 million unique buckets · 27 million total buckets

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Indexer Clustering
 What if I need Indexer Clustering for 100Tb+ · Deploy multiple Indexer Clusters · Distributed Search from SHC can Search over
Multiple Clusters
· Reduces the total number of buckets the Cluster
Master needs to manage
· Inter-cluster server communications are reduced

Large Scale Clustering Tuning Tips

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Server.conf Cxn_timeout Rcv_timeout Send_timeout
Indexes.conf rotatePeriodInSecs

Specifies how long before an intra-cluster connection will terminate (Default 60s) For large scale cluster, increase this setting to 300s
Specifies how often to check through buckets (Default 60s) For large scale cluster increase this setting to 300s

Other Benefits of Clustering

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Turn on clustering even if you don't need to replicate data · Set RF / SF = 1

 It will make indexer management lot easier

 Ability to add / remove indexers without the need to restart search heads

 BONUS : Use Indexer Discovery · This will make managing forwarders and failover to new indexers lot easier

A bad indexer in the mix (1 of 2 )

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Scenario
· One bad indexer in a group which consistently returns search
results slow and causes bad user experience

 Solution
· Turn on slow peer disconnect feature ! · This will make search results to be available to users as soon as other peers
return values
· Trade off between data fidelity vs search performance

A bad indexer in the mix ( 2 of 2 )

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Scenario
· One bad indexer in a group is experiencing problem due to faulty
disks or network cards

 Solution
· Turn on quarantine an indexer feature! · This will make sure that further searches won't be dispatched to this indexer · Very useful during upgrading an indexer to a new OS / replacing disks

Final Takeaways
If you forget everything, just remember these 3 points

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Indexing and Searching are two sides of the same coin · Overutilizing one would certainly affect other
 Spread your search workloads over different time periods · Use various scheduler enhancements
 Replicate only the relevant indexes · Be selective instead of replicating all indexes
