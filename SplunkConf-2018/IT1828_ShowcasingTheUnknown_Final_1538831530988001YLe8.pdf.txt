Our Challenges
Operational data

What Application(s) is the Monitoring Standard?
Which application can we not live without?

"I just got comfortable with one, now I have to start all over again?"

 Siloed Visibility  No consistent logs  No consistent KPIs  Logs are noise, "as-is"  Disjointed tools  No Depth

Is Our Enterprise Monitoring Actually Working?
I only care about my stuff
 Too many monitoring applications variants produce several gaps or overlaps of monitoring
 Monitors that are too shallow that don't monitor the functionality of a application and possibly it's dependencies is a big miss
 Elongated MTTIs impact the bottom line which of course also delays the start of MTTR
 Our auction business is very dependent on internet customers more than ever before · Once a proof of concept on a subset of lanes per auction is now a mandate for all lanes to
facilitate online sales
