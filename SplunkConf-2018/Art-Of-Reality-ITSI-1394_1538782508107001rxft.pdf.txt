"We Can Never See Past Choices We Don't Understand"
Where We Left Off in This Trilogy...

Get a bunch of data consistently moving through time in ITSI's Service Health Scores and KPIs

Use a bit of time shifting SPL to move the Service Health Score so you can predict the future

Build a model and operationalize with ITSI

Don't Fear the Math!
Customer Asks and Unintended Side Effects

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Top Customer Asks
 Popular Fields · Introducing Business Rules · Example: Holidays!
 External Data Sources as Features · Anything in the Search Bar is fair
game!
· Remember to build other Services in
ITSI to keep it all clean!

Unintended Side Effects: Beware!
 Removing outliers from the Service Health Score is NOT always a great idea
· You want variance from the past so
you can better understand the future
· You do this through finding anomalies
and label them as anomalies, remove, or replace the values with new `normal' values

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
Don't Like to Predict the Numbers? Then Predict the State!

 Leverage ITSI's 'Intelligence'

 Change Your Target from Numeric to State Value and Use a Classifier

 Now Your Prediction is the State

Best Practices
The Endless Time Travel Paradox

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Rule #1
 When you are building your future prediction model by shifting data through time, you must take care to only use the shifted value as the target

Rule #2
 All exceptions to Rule #1 are basically wrong.
 If you add a KPI to ITSI or field to any Splunk search that is from the future as a FEATURE to a future prediction model , you will get amazing results. And your model will fail from paradox.

Don't Fear the Math
"I am totally against the use of |reverse!"
Assuming you want to shift 7 days , and every row is a day
| streamstats window=7 current=f first(*) as *FromNow | rename ValueFromNow AS ValueFromTheFuture | rename *FromNow AS * | eval _time=strptime(_time,"%Y-%m-%d")+(24*60*60*7)

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

That last line is a doozy. We are shifting 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds * 7 days. In ITSI this will more commonly be
· | eval _time=strptime(_time,"%Y-%m-%d")+(60*5)

Why Didn't You Just Use the |predict command?
English Kind of Sucks....
| predict command is a forecast!
| predict command is a forecast!

The Splunk stock is influenced by interest rates, global economic conditions, road map, CFO's blood pressure, density of CEO's beard, AND seasonality...

The Splunk stock is cyclical, and every July stock price in the future will look like the July stock in the past +/- trending.
