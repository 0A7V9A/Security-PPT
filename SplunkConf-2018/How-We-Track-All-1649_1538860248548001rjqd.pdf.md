Advantages

Disadvantages

 All configs are versioned, great traceability

 All configs in discrete apps ... Lots of the apps to manage

 Multi-team compatible

Summary:Requires custom setup for deploying

 Better code quality viTahpiseemr irgehvitebwe too much foarpapss(mJeanllktiensa/mAnsible)

 Promote knowledge sharing with a single env irDonemveelonpt!ment skills

 Create a secure but agile environment.

 Many environments to maintain

 Off-load the searches/dashboard creation to the users, allowing admins to focus on quality checks and improvement.

 And a good DevOps spirit

Problem: Many ways to effect change
Don't give up the flexibility of splunk's native change mechanisms
 Click in the web UI  Deploy something via:
· deployment server (reload deploy-server) · cluster master (apply cluster-bundle) · search head deployer (apply shclustSero-lbuutniodlne:)  Edit conf files directly with a text edLiteotrit be!

Re-inventing btool
but better!

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 DIGRESSION: When you've re-invented btool you can do some pretty cool searching and filtering!
 E.g. I want the cron schedule and search string of every enabled correlation searches that use the Web data model · for each saved search: · is it a correlation search? · is it not disabled? · does the `search' key contain "Web."? · if yes to all, display the stanza name, cron_schedule and search string

Advantages
 Fairly easy to implement  Avoid deploying other people's
work-in-progress if they are not ready  Can do peer review at the diff stage or after-the-fact with the email  Good place to add more checks and balances

Disadvantages
 Requires discipline: never reload deploy-server directly
 Not ideal if you also use the Forwarder management Web UI to make changes
 May lie next time if the last step fails  Doesn't actually know what's up
with the deployment clients: trusts the stash is correct

reload deploy-server wrapper v2
Summary = Most important improvement!
 parse before and after server classes  compute which server classes are
affected  deduce which apps are affected  parse deployment-apps diff: compute
which apps are changed  put this together and compute summary
Serverclass.conf example:
[serverClass:Monitored_Splunk] whitelist.0=SPLUNK_searchhead* blacklist.0=SPLUNK_searchhead_b whitelist.1=SPLUNK_indexer*
[serverClass:Monitored_Splunk:app:TA-nmon]

 You can do the same on your Cluster Master for your indexer cluster.  Even simpler since no serverclass complexity.  Just stash /opt/splunk/etc/master-apps/

Advantages
 Accurately predict actual effective change!
 Accurate even if other changes have happened (e.g. direct apply shcluster-bundle)
 Warm fuzzy feeling for control freaks

Disadvantages
 Slow (rsync + canonical = 1 minute)  Fair amount of work to implement

 The advice you hear: "clone before you modify" · I don't see the point as it doesn't solve the problem
 My advice: be paranoid with upgrades!  Only for search heads
custom changes

Out-ofthe-box Splunk
A
A = Splunk 7.0.1 + ES 5.0 + ...

conflicts? upgrade changes

production Splunk
A*

Out-ofthe-box Splunk

Conclusions
"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep
your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

Last words

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Take out
 Some things are easy to do and bring a lot of value  With some significant coding you can enrich things further a long way
Words of caution
 Splunk is complicated: taking everything into account is difficult  Splunk can change: future versions might be completely different  Splunk is many: know the particularities of your setup  Don't trust the robots: scripts can save your bacon but don't blindly trust them

Change tracking: putting in git
 "rsync --delete" to Mgmt/etc  Delete all files in the Mgmt/etc_canonicalised folder (except the .git folder)  Use canonicalise script to create Mgmt/etc_canonicalised from Mgmt/etc  Then git both folders but don't forget deleted files:

Glass tables
Our tracking/backup solution

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 The backup is orchestrated by a custom search command scheduled daily
 The script behind gets the glasstables definition via the Splunk API
· 2 collectors in the KVStore to retrieve as 2 big json files: · SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite_glasstables
- /servicesNS/nobody/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite/storage/collections/data/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite_glas stables?limit=0&count=0&output_mode=json
· SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite_files (include images)
- /servicesNS/nobody/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite/storage/collections/data/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite_files ?limit=0&count=0&output_mode=json
 Each big json file is split, prettified and saved into discrete json files corresponding to individual glass tables or their dependencies.
 Each discrete json file is saved on a shared location available to the GIT server
 We then GIT the shared location and pushed into Gitlab

Out-of-the-box splunk + ES
Faking it: no need to run anything, just unpack
 Unpack splunk core tgz /var/tmp/  Unpack enterprise security tgz in /var/tmp/splunk/etc/apps/  Unpack *.tgz and *.spl from
/var/tmp/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite/install/ in /var/tmp/splunk/etc/apps/  Remove *.tgz and *.spl from /var/tmp/splunk/etc/apps/SplunkEnterpriseSecuritySuite/install/  Unpack any other TA or app spl in /var/tmp/splunk/etc/apps/  Rename any .csv.default to .csv  Make /var/tmp/splunk/etc/system/default/authentication.conf readable  Remove any bundled TA that you don't have in production  Check that you have the same apps and versions as production
