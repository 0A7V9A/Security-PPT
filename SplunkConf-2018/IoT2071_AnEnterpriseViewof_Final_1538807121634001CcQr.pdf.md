"...empowered their Owner team (the IT Team) to have direct involvement, influence, and ownership, from design through construction. With the accelerated project schedule this allowed the entire project team to make responsible, but rapid decisions, to ensure that any cost or schedule related issues were resolved with a clear understanding of the potential impact to the long term use of the facility..."

IoT and Building Intelligence
Questions for a Mature Enterprise
 Are Enterprise IT organizations aware of the direction of this technology?
 Do they have the internal skillsets required to drive and support this technology?
 Are there products already in place that can be leveraged?
 What are current offerings missing?

Critical Spaces
Office space is critical
 The user experience goes beyond the data center and the desktop
 It is at the center of the technology that keeps a building running
 Collapsing the view for all critical space is essential
