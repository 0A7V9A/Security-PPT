What is Kafka

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

Apache Kafka was originally developed by LinkedIn, and was subsequently open sourced in early 2011.

 Kafka is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable, faulttolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies.
https://kafka.apache.org/

 Kafka Connect is a framework included in Apache Kafka that integrates Kafka with other systems. Its purpose is to make it easy to add new systems to your scalable and secure stream data pipelines.

The Team

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
" Splunk Connect for Kafka introduces a scalable approach to
tap into the growing volume of data flowing into Kafka. With the largest Kafka clusters processing over one trillion messages per day and Splunk deployments reaching
petabytes ingested per day, this scalability is critical.

Sending test syslog data to test source and sink
 Send sample log using logger command:  logger --udp --server 10.10.10.4 --port 5521 "Test message from
logger" (sometimes it is useful to add more info in the message to specify more detail)  logger --tcp --server 10.10.10.5 --port 6514 "Test message from logger"  "server" can be load balancer VIP or the active source connector, depending on what you are trying to test
