What is a Use Case

What is a Use Case?

Wikipedia: A list of steps, typically defining actions between a role and a system, to achieve a goal.
Splunk: Any search created to solve a specific problem.
Use cases should address a business purpose Use cases should help the user address those purposes

When is a Use Case NOT a Use Case?

- Alert when 5+

Traditional SIEM: - TOR exit node
activity inbound - TOR exit node
suspicious activity allowed - Internal host communication with Lojack C2 Domains

-

failed login attempts are seen in 15 minutes on DB server Alert when unauthorized Drop All Roles action is seen Alert when unauthorized Drop All Users

action is seen

Splunk Version: - Threat Activity
Detected ­ Alerts when any activity matching threat intelligence is detected - Brute Force Access Behavior ­ Detects excessive number of failed logins along with a successful attempt

Matur e

· Added to address increased monitoring capabilities · May address industry or compliance specific needs

Maturi ng

· Added and refined as monitoring programs mature

Essenti als

· Apply to most organizations · Basic monitoring program

VPN Monitoring Example Use Case

 What is the problem we are trying to solve? · Violations by remote users
 What are some interesting items we might care about? · X# of failed logins on VIP account · Failed/Successful logins from geographically infeasible locations · X# of disabled accounts in Y time period

Example Use Case ­ User Behavior Monitoring
 What is the problem we are trying to solve? · Detection of malicious or compromised user activity
 What are some interesting items we might care about? · Manual login to a NHA · Account groups or roles changed · Actions performed by a user of group Y are anomalous to typical group Y users

Security Monitoring Recommendations:
For 4726(S): A user account was deleted. Important For this event, also see Appendix A: Security monitoring recommendations for many audit events. ·If you have a high-value domain or local account for which you need to monitor every change (or deletion), monitor all 4726 events with the "Target Account\Security ID" that corresponds to the account. ·If you have a domain or local account that should never be deleted (for example, service accounts), monitor all 4726 events with the "Target Account\Security ID" that corresponds to the account. ·We recommend monitoring all 4726 events for local accounts, because these accounts typically are not deleted often. This is especially relevant for critical servers, administrative workstations, and other high value assets.

Example Use Case ­ VPN Monitoring

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.

 Violations by VPN remote users
· Use Case Type: Security Monitoring, Compliance · Data Sources: VPN, Authentication
 Use Cases with Actions
· Notable created when X# of failed logins on VIP account detected. Action directs auto-ticketing
through ServiceNow connectivity for User Support to contact VIP regarding activity. Start an investigation, review logs during the timeframe in question, if appears suspicious escalate.
· Notable created after two successful logins from geographically infeasible locations.
- Smaller organization: Action directs auto-ticketing to disable the user account pending Analyst triage of event circumstances.
- Larger organization: Analyst triage and decides wither to open a ticket for contact or disable the user account.
· Notable created when X# of disabled accounts in Y time period. Analyst triage to determine if it is
a larger attack.

Example Use Case ­ User Behavior Monitoring
 Detection of malicious or compromised user activity · Use Case Type: Security Monitoring, Insider Threat · Data Sources: ALL
 Use Cases with Actions · Notable created from manual login to a NHA.
- Smaller organization: Analyst triage to determine if this was legitimate use. - Larger organization: Action auto-creates a ticket to the admin team of the asset.
· Account groups or roles changed · Actions performed by a user of group Y are anomalous to typical group Y users

Key Takeaways

© 2018 SPLUNK INC.
1. Use Cases should solve your business
issues
2. Take inventory of your data, document
what you have, understand what the data means
3. A complete Use Case identifies the
operational actions required once an alert is created
