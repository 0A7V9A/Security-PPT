Actionable Threat Intelligence: The Intelligence Life Cycle
(plus some thoughts on Wannacry / Petya)

Actionable Threat Intelligence

·

Intelligence that not only can, but also should, be acted upon.

The Intelligence Life Cycle Concepts:

­ Ignorance
­ Data ­ ­ Information
­ Knowledge

- We know nothing - We know something - We know something about what we know - What we know is useful

­ Intelligence

- What we know is actionable

­ Wisdom

- What we know is actionable in the future

CONTEXT CORROBORATION

ANALYSIS

Targeted attack challenges

VOLUME
Increased attack volume from
automated adversaries

ALERTS
Too many alerts from too many sources without context

COMPLEXITY
Highly manual response with complex workflows

Increased Attack Volume

Too Many Alerts, No Context: Data is useless without context

Three Key Concepts:

1.

Context

2.

Corroboration

3.

Complexity (increases Vulnerability, increases Exploits)

Analysis

Context

Intelligence Life Cycle expanded.....
Ignorance Data
Information Knowledge Intelligence
Wisdom Grading and Weighting
Mathematics: Probability, Statistics, Data Mining, Data Modelling, Predictive Analytics.
Tacit Knowledge
CORROBORATION
CAUTION!! ATTRIBUTION IS HARD

Metrics for success

TIME TO IDENTIFICATION
Decrease time to identify new, targeted
attack

TIME TO ERADICATION
Speed mitigation without adding specialized staff

Threat Intelligence Layers: Context and Corroboration
Threat Actors Threat Campaigns Threat Techniques Individual Breaches (Specific Binaries, Exploit Kits)
Responsiveness is Key

Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Predictive Analytics (future) Data Mining (past)

Malware Analysis: A very quick, exhaustive guide
Static (Automatic) Dynamic (Automatic) Bare Metal (Automatic and Manual)
"There are no silver Bullets"

Why?

Prevent (Known) Detect (Unknown) Prevent (Known)

You can buy many things, you cannot buy more time.
