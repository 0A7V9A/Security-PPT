What is a Threat Library?
Knowledge Base for distilled and curated intelligence insights produced by CTI Research Teams & OSINT Sources.

- It's not a solution by itself. - It's not a collection of all existing attacks. - It's not an indicator feed. - It's not perfect. - It's not fixed in time.

- Normalized, cataloged and vetted information - APT activity journal - Key observables for specific threats - Context for adversary emulation - APT operation analysis and evolution through time - All-in-One Accessible Information

- Overabundance of data - Diverse formatting and distribution - Lack of context - Lack of indicators/evidence - Lack of linked activity - Partial information - Uncatalogued information - Disappearing sources - Overlapping/misattribution

Basic Information · Affected Regions/Countries/Industries · Campaign Summary Main Information · Initial Access · Tools · Repercussions Technical Analysis · Campaign Evidence Analysis, Attribution and Geolocation · Analysis · Attribution · Geolocation Evidence

Basic Information
· Aliases · Description
Behavioral Analysis
· Campaign · Techniques (ATT&CK) · Tactics (ATT&CK) · Description · Details
Indicators of Compromise Related Threat Actors

Basic Information · Affected
Regions/Countries/Industries · Known Aliases · Threat Actor Type · Motivations · Sophistication level Relevant Information Toolset · Tool & Description

TTPs · Tool · Technique (ATT&CK) · Tactic (ATT&CK) · Technique Description Campaigns · Campaign date · Campaign name · Campaign description · Campaign intended effect · Confidence level

- False flag campaigns - Analyst bias - Misattribution - Misinterpretation of the observables

- False flag campaigns - Analyst bias - Misattribution - Misinterpretation of the observables - Analyst lack of specific knowledge

Spanish as official language

Spanish as official language
Countries which use that expression

- False flag campaigns - Analyst bias - Misattribution - Misinterpretation of the observables - Analyst lack of specific knowledge - Overlapping Attributions

Rate your sources:
· Type · Region visibility · Reputation · Availability of IOCs
But...

... overrule your own formula if necessary.

1. Read the source.
 Identify a paragraph describing a behavior.
2. Identify first which tactic it belongs to.
 Simplify the description in a sentence.
3. Identify the technique.
Create your own!

- Choose a good technology to build on. - Be prepared to evolve.
- Do not misunderstand the objectives. - It's not about collecting everything.
- Define good quality workflows.

- Choose your taxonomy and stick with it.
- STIX and ATT&CK
- Think about how the information is going to be consumed.
- Define a good structure beforehand.
-Be consistent!!
