Overview  Organizations need to implement information security controls
­ NIST SP 800-53, PCI-DSS, CIS Controls
 Control selection should be driven by threats and vulnerabilities
­ ATT&CK can help!
 We have challenges:
­ Which controls do we select (and why)? ­ How do our controls map to ATT&CK techniques?
 Many organizations create ATT&CK  Control mappings
­ How can we as the ATT&CK team help centralize these?

ATT&CK-Controls Mapping

 By mapping ATT&CK to common control frameworks we can:

­ Identify controls that mitigate threats we care about ­ Identify capability gaps ­ Better understand our cybersecurity effectiveness

ATT&CK Tactics

Initial Access

NSA Top 10 Mitigation Strategies

Identify Protect

Detect Respond

1. Update and Upgrade Software Immediately

2. Defend Privileges and Accounts

3. Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies

4. Exercise a System Recovery Plan

5. Actively Manage Systems and Configurations

6. Continuously Hunt for Network Intrusions

7. Leverage Modern Hardware Security Features

8. Segregate Networks Using Application-Aware Defenses

9. Integrate Threat Reputation Services

10. Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication

Mapping Challenges  Mapping criteria  Changing control standards  Scale  Differing configurations and implementations  Some organizations have created internal mappings but...
­ Sharing externally can be difficult ­ Results in duplication of effort ­ Hinders collaboration and innovation

Our Future Goals  Provide a curated source of trusted mappings
­ Support community contributions
 Develop a flexible mapping data structure
­ Responsive to change ­ Able to scale
 Present mappings in a user-friendly application
­ Similar to the ATT&CK Navigator
