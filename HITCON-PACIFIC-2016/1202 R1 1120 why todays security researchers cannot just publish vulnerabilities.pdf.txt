why today's security researchers cannot just publish vulnerabilities
1

About me ­ Noam Rathaus
· I have been working in the security field since the age of 13 (yes I'm old...)
· Wrote 4 books on Penetration Testing and Fuzzing · Found over 40 vulnerabilities in various types of
software · Wrote about a third of the code of Nessus
· when it was still Open Source · wrote over 500 tests out of the 1000 tests it had
back then

About Beyond Security
· I founded Beyond Security with my colleague Aviram Jenik · The company today:
· SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure - vulnerability acquisition program since 2007
· AVDS - vulnerability management system · beSTORM - a commercial fuzzing tool

Researcher needs to do research
· Researchers do not want to mess with the vendors / disclosure ­ too much hassle better things to do
· Research disclosure may backfire:

Money
· Researcher wants to get paid for his effort · Days of hard work, will not lead to adequate compensation. A researcher wants to maximize the amount of money he gets paid for, and he needs to an expert to do this for him
· (Potential) Non-existing compensation · Unless you go through an agreed contract or paid research you may end up with not getting any payment

So you found vulnerability! What should you do next?
· We believe you are a good person ­ so you probably want to disclosed it responsibly
· What are your options?

Bug bounty

Brokers

Do I need to say?

Introduction
· There are 3 main routes to contact the vendor: · Email the contact information showed in the vendor website · Bug bounty program ­ if the vendor has one · Friends / colleagues / community
· Let's review the difficulties in the process of reporting vulnerabilities to the vendors

Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Environmental factors (1)
· Language is a barrier · Beside the obvious your language to some foreign language · Also Technical (researcher) to Sales (company) ­ in many places the sales team gets the "lead" on a new vulnerability
· Researcher may have a day job · It's possible that the job would forbid him from doing this publicly, anonymity is important
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Environmental factors (2)
· Time is limited · You work hard on finding the vulnerabilities and you want to move on to the next item · Spending time talking and chasing the vendor, convincing him that he needs to fix the vulnerabilities, and waiting for him to fix them can take months

Endless cycle (from discovery to patch)
3 Month from initial report to patch being
released

Bureaucracy (1)
· Hostile vendors · Want to sue you, not get the information from you
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Bureaucracy (2)
· Legislation · Privacy and computer laws may prevent the researcher from disclosing issues that affect "humans" (Real Name, Private profiles, etc) · Vulnerability disclosure and discovery may be illegal in the country where the researcher lives in

Bug bounties (1)

Bug bounties (2)
· May get unhandled or ignored ­ best case scenario you will get an explanation, usually nothing
· In many cases it's a "web site" not a person you are communicating with ­ there is no way to "escalate" it or move it forward in some way
· In most cases you will paid low sums of money or get a Free T-shirt!
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Conclusions
· A lot of work for a free T-shirt! · You won't get your research published · Time consuming

Bug Bounty Platforms ­ evolution?

Bug bounties

Introduction
· Bug bounty platforms try different approach to answer the problems shown above: · One place for the vendors to contact with the security researchers · "Bug bounty" program for small ­ medium companies (anyone can take a part) · Fast access for the security researcher to report the vulnerabilities · The security researcher can gain reputation

Reality (1)
· The bug bounty platforms did some good things · The rules in each bug bounty program are published · You contact the security team directly · All the vendors in one place · You gain reputation (kindof...)
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Reality ­ The downside (1)
· There is no negotiation · you report your vulnerability and hope for the best · Most of the vendors don't pay ­ a free T-shirt / few hundreds dollars · The platform does not enforce the amount of money a vendor needs to pay for the researcher
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Reality ­ The downside (2)
Reputation - Most of the reported vulnerabilities do not get published · through vendor advisory · The researcher still needs to be in contact with the vendor
· Time consuming · Miss understanding
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Conclusions
· Bug bounty programs are a step in the evolution but not the solution
· As long there is no third party reviewing the vulnerabilities and determined how much they worth ­ the bug bounty programs will remain "a nice thing to have"

The Dark Side

Shady Business
· The business of paid vulnerability disclosure has become a hot subject over the years, this has brought much improvement but also a lot of shady stuff
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

So what do we do?
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

(1)
· Guarantied payment ­ escrow process · Quick response (within 24 hours) · A human person that can
· Answer your questions and give you advise · Help you negotiate with on all aspects, price, details,
scope, vulnerability type, etc before you send in your research material ­ giving you the control
Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

(2)
· Different ways to get paid - Bitcoin, PayPal, Wire transfer and of course Victoria's Secret gift cards
· A system where you get more than "just" money · Free training and courses · Free conference access · Software and hardware to help you with your research or your next target

Beyond Security Noam Rathaus, CTO

Summary
· As you can see there are many problems and pitfalls in the path of disclosure and paid vulnerability researcher
· Use this presentation as a reference guide to what to expect, what to "fight" over, and most importantly on how to make the most out of it
