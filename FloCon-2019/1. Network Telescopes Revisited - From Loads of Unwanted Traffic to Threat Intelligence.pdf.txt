Network Telescope Also known as darknet or blackhole. Unused IP address space. No legitimate network traffic should be observed.
 First (?) & largest telescope (approx /8):

Network Telescope
In practice, we can see a lot of different activities: Misconfiguration of network devices/applications.  Scanning. Backscatter from DoS attacks. Exploitation attempts (UDP). Weird stuff.

DoS attacks (backscatter)

What we want to achieve?
 Detect large-scale malicious events (botnets, exploits).  Detect attacks on interesting targets.  Track activities of specific actors responsible.  Understand the dynamics (trends).

Problems
 How to group packets?  How to classify them into events?  How to find interesting events?  How to identify actors?  How to analyze trends?

Traffic going to network telescope

Our approach

1. Monitored IPv4 space: > 100 000 addresses

2. Analyze captured traffic every 5 minutes.

Stats: ~ 10 000 pps ~ 25 000 000 000 packets per month 80% = TCP

Traffic going to network telescope

Parser L7 up to L4 payload

Parser L7

Two parsing scripts:  Parser L4 ­ up to 4th OSI layer. written in C++, uses libtins library.

 Parser 7 ­ parsing of 7th OSI layer. written in python, uses dpkt library

Github 1.3 Tbps DoS

Reported 1.7 Tbps DoS

Day 1 ­ 20.02 (first scan)
 Only 4 IP addresses  Source: DigitalOcean, UK  Duration: 25 minutes  Constant source port per source IP  One payload used (memcached statistics)

Day 5 ­ 24.02 (new actor)
 Only 1 IP addresses  Source:AS 27176, DataWagon LLC, US  Small hosting with anti-DDoS  Randomized source ports  New payload  Scan lasted longer: 3 hours

And so on... Pre-GitHub scanners
Distribution of source IPs
 About 60 IP addresses.  Several scanning patterns.

And so on... Post-GitHub scanners
Distribution of source IPs
 About 315 IP addresses.  Multiple scanning patterns.

Looking deeper into packets

PGA
 PGA = custom code to generate packets
 Improve DDoS Botnet Tracking with Honeypots,Ya Liu, 360 Netlab, Botconf 4th edition, Dec 2016
 Usually simple operations, examples
 constant values  byte swap  incrementation
 Leaves patterns that can be used for IDS  Our tool detects patterns and creates new signatures

PGA examples

1. Mirai: TCP_SEQ = IP_DST

2. XoR.DDoS PGA:
IP_ID = SPORT TCP_SEQ[1:2] = IP_ID

PGA example

Signatures everywhere
SYN FLOOD on IP belonging to Google ­ full of PGA signatures.

Signatures everywhere
SYN FLOOD on IP belonging to Google ­ full of PGA signatures.

1. SPORT = TCP_SEQ[1:2]

2.TCP_SEQ[3:4] = 0xFFFF

3. SPORT = IP_SRC[3:4]

Operations

Operational value of network telescopes
 Raw output from analyzers is not actionable (too many events)  Scans   abuse notifications (automated for high confidence events)
 PGA fingerprint1ing   Shadowserver remediation feeds
 DoS attacks   situational awareness & alerts
 Automated feeds provide limited "i2ntelligence" 3

 Network owners: send an email to n6@cert.pl to sign up  Usually working with national CSIRTs

Aiming for actual intelligence
 In-depth analysis of events extracted from the traffic  insight into TTP  more difficult to automate
 Anomaly / trend detection:
 forecast ex1ploitation campaigns.
 new campaigns
 Attribute activities to botne2ts / actors 3

Future plans

 Combine network telescopes with other data sources
Honeypots, sandboxes, botnet tracking

 Research collab1oration:
Looking for help in linking PGA signatures to tools / malware
