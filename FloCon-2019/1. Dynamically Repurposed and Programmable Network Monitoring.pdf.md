The Problems
· 100G is the new 10G (and 400G is right around the corner) · Network standards are evolving faster than ever (overlays,
underlays, new protocols) · Traditional switch/router vendors are designing gear for efficient
transport, not intelligent analysis · Custom silicon solutions take years to develop and fixed-function
devices are obsolete almost as fast as they come on the market

MantisNet RFP-NG
· Rules match:
· L2/2.5 Match (SMAC, DMAC, EtherType, 802.1Q, MPLS) · L3 IPv4, IPv6 · L4 TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP, IGMP · L4+ GTP, DPI*
· Actions:
· Permit, Deny, Push/Pop/Replace 802.1Q, NetFlow
· Flow-aware load balancing, round-robin distribution, replication · Counters galore!

So What Can Your IDS/Firewall Handle?

CASE STUDY: Load Balancing From Hell
· 2x100G inputs · 32x10G outputs · Frame From Hell:
· Flow-aware load balance on the inner 5-tuple · P4 Development time: 1 day

CASE STUDY: MAC-in-MAC

802.1aq

802.1aq

P4 Development time: 3 days

CASE STUDY: Intelligent Patch Panel/SDN
· Mix and match: 32x100G, 32x40G, or 128x10G · Point-to-Point traffic direction · "Monitor" (replicate to read-only port(s)) · P4 Development time: 1 day

CASE STUDY: NetFlow
· 128k flowlet hash-based cache · Selection criteria based on Packet Broker rule match · Recorded Data:
· Ingress port · IPv4 SIP/DIP/protocol · TCP/UDP/SCTP SPORT/DPORT · TCP flags · Start time/Update time · Packet count/Octet count
· 3 Different ways to egress flowlets
· DMA rings, P4 generate_digest() primitive, Packet cloning/repurposing
· P4 Development time: 1 month

CASE STUDY: HTTP Attack
· 32k IPv4 CIDR SIP suppression table · ~ Dozen throttle-attack detection signatures · 8k URI signatures · Clone key packets out of band to customer's follow on processor
· Follow on processor populates IPv4 CIDR SIP rules to suppress/honeypot hosts based on key frame analysis
· P4 Development time: 2 days

CASE STUDY: In-Band Telemetry
· Injected a customer header after Ethernet (custom etherType) containing:
· Offset to start of inner-most IPv4/IPv6 header · Offset to start of payload · Original next etherType
· P4 Development Time: 2 days

CASE STUDY: Out-of-Band Telemetry
· Used existing Packet Broker functionality to build an L4 portbased categorizer
· 8k ports matched · 15 second update time · Raw and delta stats on a packet and octet basis · Output in JSON to a kafka queue
· P4 Development Time: 0 days!
