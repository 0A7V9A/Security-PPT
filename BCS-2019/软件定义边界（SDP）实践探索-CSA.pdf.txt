PastMost servers and end-user devices
are inside the "wall". Enterprise security
are mainly focused on Intranet protection.

SDP Security Architecture defined by CSA
FutureNo clear boundary between Intranet and Internet. No matter where the servers are users are located, users would always be able to securely access authorized data

SDP User Case Study
Case Study: Secure Transition to Cloud 
BackgroundBranch offices and partners need to access some
enterprise applications. As the locations are distributed and devices are not managed, MPLS or VPN are not good options. The enterprise decided to migrate the applications to public cloud.
ChallengesAs application servers are accessible on public Internet, they
are frequently under attacks or crawler scanning.
