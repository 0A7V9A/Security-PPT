BandWagon Effect
As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.

Polls says yes, and you see NO re-ellections. Why
The spiral of silence theory is a political science and mass communication theory proposed by the German political scientist Elisabeth NoelleNeumann, which stipulates that individuals have a fear of isolation, which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea.

Detection approaches

Detecting bot communities  by account parameters

·Account lifetime

·Avatars ·Comments

Also - generative user names oddness in profile data

·Following

·Followers

·Isolated communities

·Account lifecycle

·Timing evaluation (race conditions) real staff starts slowly

·Groups of users cluster into individual group and only talk to each other

Detecting bot communities  by information distribution behavior
·Posting speed ·Active hours (how many of you work 24/7) ·Simultaneous activity on promoting topics ·(timing evaluation (race conditions) real staff starts slowly) ·Triggering points (how bots following botmaster) ·Spotting botmaster ·Communities

Detecting bot users
·Groups of users sharing the same content in random order ·Groups of users share similar properties in profile (or images) ·Timing evaluation (race conditions) real staff starts slowly ·Groups of users cluster into individual group and only talk to each other

Community Detection: Easy

Why 24 hours before is important?
"The last minute swing" effect Noelle-Neumann first began studying this spiral of silence in the 1960s to help understand an extreme shift of public sentiment in a 1965 German election (NoelleNewman, 1993). She noted a "last minute swing" in a neck-and-neck election that seemed to shift almost overnight as public opinion polls began to reveal a slight majority opinion. Noelle-Neumann likens the last minute swing phenomenon in political elections as "running with the pack" or a "go-along" mentality. What drives that mentality, Noelle-Neumann explains, is fear of isolation. "The fear of isolation seems to be the force that sets the spiral of silence in motion"
