· Early stage / seed / accelerator projects ­ while disrupting many segments of VC have made only modest inroads into cybersecurity funding
· 1011 will incubate 1 project / year starting in 2016 ­ blockchain as business trust tool candidate
· Person driven fit with segment investment thesis
· Series A Valuations in general are rich, but selectively workable
· High versus historic standards, but returns still work for successful companies · Seed/convertible note caps hitting market, up from convertible price if business working
· Valuation expectations in few segments are getting high / borderline "pencils down"
· Late stage growth for Silicon Valley companies · Israeli based Series B, C rounds getting very pricey · Star based CEO / CTO founders at all time high valuation levels · Billion dollar funds brands impacting valuations as well ­ AH effect / effectively insider
rounds
· Geographical strategy and reach outside Valley of 1011 ­ very beneficial
· Europe, Rest of US ­ good companies exists with less VC and valuation competition
· Corporate venture teams very active in security (VMWare, HP, EMC, Siemens)
