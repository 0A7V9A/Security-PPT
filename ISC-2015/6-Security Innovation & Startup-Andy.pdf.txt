THE ATTACKER'S ADVANTAGE
 They only need to be successful once  Determined, skilled and often funded adversaries  Custom malware, 0days, multiple attack vectors,
social engineering  Persistent

IMPORTANCE OF SHARING
"In the case of threat-intelligence sharing, the adversary has only to mess up once ­ being detected ­ and all the defenders will know about it. It's in our best interest, as an industry, to keep the odds ever in our favor."
-- Wendy Nather, 451 Group, 2014 Threat Intelligence Report
 Helps you to achieve a preventative response to changes in the threat landscape by learning how attackers are targeting others
 Armed with real-time, detailed security event information, you can update your defenses to avoid becoming a victim
 The right solution will allow you to automatically share anonymized threat information

OTX 1.0
IP REPUTATION DATA

 Updates provided every 30 minutes  200,000-350,000 validated malicious IP's at any point

Malware Domain Distributing malware or hosting exploit code
Malware IP Instrumental in malware, including malicious redirection
Command and Control Sending command and control instructions to malware or a botnet
Scanning Host Observed repeatedly scanning or probing remote systems
APT Observed to be actively involved in an APT campaign

OTX 2.0: "PULSES"
CROWD SOURCED THREAT RESEARCH
 THE FACE OF OTX ­ SOCIAL INTERFACE TO COLLABORATIVELY DEVELOP & SHARE THREAT INTELLIGENCE IN REALTIME
 CREATE, ENHANCE OR CONSUME "PULSES" ­ SHORT MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF THREAT INDICATORS
 EXPORT INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE INTO SECURITY TOOLS (OPENIOC, STIX) AND AUTOMATICALLY CONSUME IN ALIENVAULT PRODUCTS
 INTEGRATE & EXPLORE THROUGH AN OPEN API
 STRENGTHEN DEFENSES AND HELP OTHERS DO THE SAME

INVESTIGATING THREATS
 Pulse: ONE data construct for ALL types of
threats (Data breach, Botnet, APT Campaign, etc.)
 Defined by Indicators of Compromise or IoCs:
(md5, IPv4s, URLs, hostnames, etc.)
 Explore attack vectors and threat geolocation

SUMMARY
EFFECTIVE THREAT SHARING
 Crowd-source threat data without attribution  Provide valuable intelligence that can be acted on quickly  Facilitate the collection, validation and dissemination of
diverse, crowd sourced threat data  Open, collaborative and affordable  Enable organizations to share threat intelligence with each
other in a trusted environment  Should span industries, market categories and geographies
