 Preserve evidence

 Acquisition

 Examination and Analysis

 Reporting

Evidence preservation is the process of securely maintaining
custody of property without altering or changing the contents of data that reside on devices and
removable media.

Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise
obtaining information from a mobile device and its associated media.

The examination process uncovers digital evidence, including that which may be hidden or obscured. The analysis process differs from examination in that it looks at the results of the examination for its direct significance and probative value to the case.

Reporting is the preparing a detailed summary of all
the steps taken and conclusions reached in the investigation
of a case.
