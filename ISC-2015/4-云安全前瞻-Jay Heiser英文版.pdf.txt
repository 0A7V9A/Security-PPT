Cloud Security Scenario
Jay Heiser @JayHeiser1

STRATEGIC PLANNING ASSUMPTION
Through 2020, 95% of cloud security failures will be the customer's fault.

Why it won't happen:
· If a provider failure does occur, it could have huge levels of impact.
· The cloud market continues to be financially weak.

Why it will happen:
· The history of public cloud computing has been remarkably free of provider failures.
· Cloud service providers are under huge market and Internet pressure:
­ They must make security a priority. They have no choice.

KEY ISSUES
1.How worried should you be about which public cloud risks? 2.What do you need to do to manage those risks?

What About Security? Cloud Adoption Survey (2014)
What are the top three reasons for NOT considering a public cloud-based model?
n = 210, Base: Does not primarily employ Public Cloud for IaaS, Paas and/or SaaS

Security and/or privacy concerns Concerns about government snooping
Data integration challenges Compliance requirements prevent public cloud usage Lack of internal skills to manage public cloud services
Data center locations don't meet data sovereignty... Insufficient SLAs from cloud service providers Time to deployment Difficulty of development Lack development tools and resources Lack of cloud service provider options
Dislike for release schedules and impact on app... Public cloud services are not environmentally friendly

Cybercriminals Are Not Stealing Cloud Storage. They Are Stealing Your User's Accounts
Phishing is the biggest source of cloud security failure.

Enterprises Are Focusing on the Wrong Party to Improve Security
Cloud services are not getting breached.
Most security incidents are the customer's fault. The big story in cloud security is that big hacks and failures have not occurred.

Organizations Rushing to the Cloud Underestimate the Effort to Control How It Will Be Used
· Account and virtual machine management. · Access control:
­ Inappropriate internal shares. ­ Public shares. · Visibility and control of activity: ­ Sanctioned and unsanctioned usage. ­ Incident response. ­ E-discovery. · Integration with other services.
· Recovery after provider bankruptcy or accident.
How will you support someone else's applications when they break?

Use a Life Cycle Approach for Cloud Governance

Policies

End of life

Requirements analysis

Usually needs more attention

Continuous management

Risk acceptance

Implementation

Most enterprises are only addressing part of the life cycle

Base Your Cloud Usage Decisions Around the Public Cloud Risk Domains
Ability to support unanticipated future needs
Agility

Regulatory and other legal requirements Compliance

Service Availability disruptions and
data loss

Changes in cloud provider Supplier business model or viability

Security Confidentiality and data control

Evolving Cloud Encryption Approaches

· Relatively easy: ­ Extend data encryption to endpoints
· Becoming easier: ­ Customer-managed key (CMK)
· Difficult or impossible: ­ Format preserving ­ Searchable ­ Homomorphic

Externally applied encryption can break cloud application functionality
