3D-Signature
· 3D signature: handwriting in 3D space
· Write short, easy to remember passwords in the space,
· 2 or 3 characters

ª Behavioral biometrics:

² Can be updated

ª

² Difficult to duplicate

² A weak typed password can s.ll be strong if it is wriBen in 3D space

Challenges:
² Change over .me? ² Reject malicious users? ² Accept genuine users?

How to capture 3D signature?
· Microsoft Kinect
· A motion input RGB-D sensor · Launched by Microsoft for Xbox 360 and Windows PCs
· Advantages
· Low cost · Captures 3D information
· Depth sensor
· Works in the dark
· Disadvantages
· Low resolution · Measurement errors

4.2.2 Feature Processing
In practice, the values of different features may have different ranges, but their relevancy towards the correct verification are not necessarily determined by their ranges. For example, a path angle has a range of [ , ] while the position px(t) has been scaled to the range of [0, 1]. This does not mean that a path angle is 3 times more relevant than a position. Thus, we perform two-step feature processing: normalization and weight selection.
First, we normalize each feature such that it conforms to
Verifica/on a normal Gaussian distribution N (0, 1) over all the frames.
Second, we weigh each feature differently to achieve a better performance. To obtain the weight for each feature (dimension), we selected a small set of training samples for each signature (e.g., n = 4 samples for each signature), and verified these training samples using the DTW classifier (to be discussed in Section 5) based on one feature (dimension). For each feature (dimension), we obtain a verification rate for each signature, i.e., the percentage of genuine samples in the top n = 4 ranked samples, and we simply consider the average verification rate over all signatures as the weight
