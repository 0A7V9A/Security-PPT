SECURING CLOUD APPLICATIONS
Three Ways MFA Can Help

CLOUD APPS NEED MORE THAN PASSWORD PROTECTION
Many cloud applications authenticate users with passwords alone. That's an alarming notion, considering the sensitive data stored in these systems--which ranges from personally identifiable information (PII) to payment data and corporate trade secrets. While some cloud providers offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) capabilities, using several MFA tools from multiple providers adds complexity for both users and IT staff. With RSA SecurID® Access, you get one modern authentication system capable of protecting all your apps, from the ground to the cloud.
RSA SecurID Access can provide users with a seamless authentication experience when logging into cloud applications--including Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.com, Workday and ServiceNow with mobile MFA--without compromising security or disrupting their ability to do their jobs.

RSA SecurID® Access provides three ways to secure cloud applications with MFA:
Give users a choice of authentication methods.
Challenge only according to level of risk.
Make it easy for users and admins.

THREE WAYS TO SECURE CLOUD APPLICATIONS WITH MFA

1 GIVE USERS A CHOICE OF AUTHENTICATION METHODS
Allow users to choose the methods most convenient for them, such as mobileoptimized MFA that includes push-toapprove and biometrics--and offer it all through one solution provider.

2 CHALLENGE ONLY ACCORDING TO LEVEL OF RISK
To further reduce access friction, ask for step-up authentication only when analytics report that a user or situation presents a risk.

3 MAKE IT EASY FOR USERS AND ADMINS
Many cloud application providers also offer MFA capabilities, but that means more applications and tools for the end user to remember, and more MFA solutions for you to manage. Keep it simple with one authentication solution that covers all your apps.

AUTHENTICATION FOR CLOUD APPLICATIONS

MFA FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE 365
Microsoft Office 365 makes it easier for employees to access email, productivity apps and SharePoint data from wherever they're working. MFA from RSA SecurID Access can help you keep unauthorized users out, while ensuring legitimate users easy access to mission-critical productivity tools.

MFA FOR SALESFORCE.COM
Salesforce holds some of your organization's most prized data--customer information, sales and marketing plans, and much more. So it's worth protecting with more than just a username and password. RSA SecurID Access can help keep this data safe--without making it harder for your sales reps to close that big deal.

MFA FOR WORKDAY
Social security numbers. Tax information. Salary data. Performance reviews. That's just some of the highly sensitive data stored in Workday--information you wouldn't want ending up on the dark web, or the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Make sure the people accessing this data are who they say they are, with RSA SecurID Access.

MFA FOR SERVICENOW
If you're using ServiceNow to run critical functions such as IT, HR or customer service, you could easily have thousands of users inside and outside of your organization accessing the platform. You want to be sure that only legitimate users access ServiceNow--and that if an unauthorized user does try to gain access, you can quickly identify and prevent it. RSA SecurID Access can help you flag and deny suspicious access attempts.
