RSA® FRAUDACTIONTM CYBER INTELLIGENCE

SOLUTION BRIEF

ABOUT THE RSA FRAUDACTION INTELLIGENCE OPERATION
The RSA FraudAction intelligence operation is comprised of a dedicated team of analysts who monitor underground forums, IRC chat rooms, the open web (OSINT) and other communication channels where cybercriminals congregate to sell and buy services and tools and exchange knowledge.
Leveraging highly skilled, multilingual expertise and years of underground presence, RSA FraudAction analysts have been "grandfathered" into forums as trusted players. Our analysts cover activity in forums of different languages, including Chinese, Russian, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and others.
The forums vary in size, traffic volume and prestige. In many cases, the forums monitored by analysts are closed forums that require admission fees and "vouching" by a senior member(s). Some of the exclusive forums monitored by RSA are closed to new users and are considered by cybercriminals to be more secure exchange platforms.

ADVANCED TARGETED

RSA FRAUDACTION CYBER INTELLIGENCE TIER 1: GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
This tier is designed for organizations interested in feed-based, automated intelligence consumption. Feeds are available in several formats and can be integrated into different back-end appliances/systems. The nature of intelligence is mostly general and includes complimentary access to threat reports that provide insight into emerging cybercrime threats and trends. The following is a breakdown of deliverables and their content:

IP FEED Type: Content:
Frequency: Format: Encryption: Delivery: Categories:

General
IP addresses that are more likely to route fraudulent traffic, extracted from cybercrime and fraudster-published lists
Daily
CSV, XLS, EDS
Encrypted ZIP, PGP
Email, SFTP
The feed contains different IP categories as listed below:
­­ Proxies/SOCKS--Proxies are used to facilitate access to content on the world wide web in order to provide anonymity to the individual using it. The IP addresses in this category are published or traded among fraudsters in the underground and are used to hide the source of their fraudulent activity.
­­ Open Source Proxies--IP addresses that are published on websites that offer free proxies. Although a legitimate service, it is often used also by fraudsters as a way of hiding the source of their fraudulent activity.
­­ RDPs--RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, which allows remote connection to a Trojaninfected machine by the fraudster that hacked it. This category is comprised of PC system coordinates (IP address and port number) that were publicly exposed and posted in the underground along with their login passwords.
­­ TOR Nodes--TOR is free software for enabling online anonymity. This category is comprised of IP addresses gathered from open source resources that share IP addresses of TOR exit nodes. Although a legitimate service, it is often used by fraudsters as a way of hiding the source of their fraudulent activity.

Recommendations:

Customers can also choose to receive only specific categories.
Customers are advised to:
1. Monitor incoming communication from IP addresses of all categories, as they may be utilized by fraudsters and other machines seen in the wild used for malicious activities.
2. Specifically for IP addresses in the "RDP" category, also monitor outgoing communication from these IPs, as the infected system may reside within the corporate network.

EMAIL FEED Type: Content: Frequency: Format: Encryption: Delivery: Categories:
Recommendations:

General
Email addresses that have been shared on both underground and open source forums or gathered from Trojan logs. These emails are more likely to be in the hands of fraudsters and used in fraudulent activity.
Daily
CSV, XLS, EDS
Encrypted ZIP, PGP
Email, SFTP
The feed contains different email categories,
as listed below:
­­ Lists published in the underground by hackers/ fraudsters who hack into other forum member databases or hack the user databases of online CC shops
­­ Lists published on open source public text sharing sites such as Pastebin.com
­­ Database leaks caused by hacktivists ­­ Lists extracted from underground forums reporting
fraudsters who stole from others ("rippers") ­­ Spam emails--Email addresses shared by fraudsters
with fellow fraudsters, to be utilized in spam campaigns. As such, these emails are more likely to be targeted by phishing and "spear-phishing" emails. ­­ Compromised emails--Legitimate email addresses that are published along with their passwords and are therefore more likely to get exploited by fraudsters for identity theft or corporate network access Customers can also choose to receive only specific categories.
Customers are advised to search for these emails
within their user base and increase the risk level of
accounts associated with those email addresses, per
the company's security policy.

RSA FRAUDACTION CYBER INTELLIGENCE TIER 2: TARGETED INTELLIGENCE
This tier is designed for organizations that require the additional layer of proactive (human) investigation into deep-web sources. Tier 2 includes all Tier 1 deliverables (see above) with the addition of highly targeted (relating directly to your brand) threat feeds. Furthermore, our analysts proactively investigate and research deepweb sources in search for intelligence relating to your brand.

COMPROMISED CREDIT CARDS

Type:

Targeted--customer-specific based on customer's BIN numbers

Content:

Compromised credit/debit card numbers traced in the underground and open source

Frequency:

Ad hoc

Format:

CSV, XLS, EDS

Encryption:

Encrypted ZIP, PGP

Delivery:

Email, SFTP

Recommendations: Customers are advised to:

1. Validate the card information provided.

2. Immediately block the credit/debit cards recovered, as these details are accessible to fraudsters. The card details may be used to commit fraud.

CREDIT CARD STORE PREVIEWS

Type:

Targeted--customer-specific based on customer's BIN numbers

Introduction:

Automated credit card stores sell credit/debit card data to fraudsters in the underground. Fraudsters browse through a shop's credit card "catalog," which includes partial information on the compromised card (e.g., six-digit BIN, cardholder's name and address). Once a card is purchased, the store reveals the complete credit card information for the use of the purchasing fraudster.

Content: Frequency:

Data is sent as recovered from the store, (i.e., the partial information that is visible without purchasing the cards).
Partial card details obtained from both known and newly discovered underground online shops. An automated parser periodically downloads new card previews from these stores, which are then delivered to customers via the feed.
Ad hoc

RSA® FRAUDACTIONTM CYBER INTELLIGENCE | 7

Format:
Encryption: Delivery: Recommendations:

CSV, XLS, EDS
There are two columns in the CC Previews Feed Excel spreadsheet: six-digit BIN followed by ten "0"s; and the BIN along with any info that was attached to it (e.g., cardholder name, address and issuer). Encrypted ZIP, PGP Email, SFTP In many cases issuers can use the partial information to trace the compromised cards' full details. The early tracing of cards is part of mitigating future fraud attempts. Customers are advised to review the compromised card previews and to attempt to trace their full details using the extracted data. It is then recommended to do the following:
1. Verify whether the cards are truly "fresh" (they have yet to be used to commit fraud).
2. Block the compromised cards or closely monitor their transactions.
3. Notify the affected cardholder as per the bank's policies.
4. Search for common denominators of all or most of the cards (such as a common demographic profile of cardholders). Such details may enable tracing.

COMPROMISED CREDENTIALS

Type:

Targeted--based on customer's login URLs

Content:

As part of the RSA FraudAction operation, it monitors Trojan drop servers on a continuous basis. Any data that has been captured by the Trojan and that relates to your customers will be reported to you.

Frequency:

Ad-hoc

Format:

CSV, XML

Our system is capable of parsing the raw data (as retrieved from the drop site) into readable fields (or parameters).

Encryption: Delivery:

If you would like the system to parse specific fields (for example, your website requires your end user to fill in custom login fields), you can provide the field names as they appear in the HTML form, and our system will attempt to parse them. Encrypted ZIP, PGP Email, FA Dashboard Portal

RSA® FRAUDACTIONTM CYBER INTELLIGENCE | 8

Recommendations:

There are two methods you can use to attempt to identify compromised end users:
1. Searching for the actual login credential sets within the raw data. The way to identify this data within the raw data varies based on the specific Trojan family involved.
2. Pairing the stolen data, along with IP, and crossreferencing with the incoming traffic to the website (login page).
Customers are advised to use the details in these alerts to trace affected accounts of end users infected with malware. In general, it is advised to closely monitor these accounts for outgoing transfers, in an attempt to identify mule accounts or block them according to your policies
