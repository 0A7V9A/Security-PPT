YUBIKEY FOR RSA SECURID® ACCESS
ENTERPRISE SECURITY MADE EASY

RELYING SOLELY ON PASSWORD SECURITY PUTS ENTERPRISE DATA AT RISK
Catastrophic security breaches top world headlines every day, and for good reason. A single corporate security breach costs an average of $3.86M1, and 81% of breaches are caused by stolen or weak passwords.2 As a result, IT organizations cannot rely exclusively on passwords to protect access to corporate data. Adopting stronger employee and customer authentication is essential to avoiding risk and becoming the next target.
ENABLE A PASSWORDLESS FUTURE
The YubiKey for RSA SecurID® Access is a hardware-based FIDO authentication solution that provides superior defense against phishing, eliminates account takeovers and reduces IT costs. Combined with best-in-class credential management and enterprise-grade security, the YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access streamlines authentication, and paves the way to a passwordless future.
PREVENT MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS AND ELIMINATE ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS
Software on a computer or phone is vulnerable to malware and hackers. The YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access is based on hardware with the authentication secret stored on a separate secure chip built into the key, with no connection to the internet so it cannot be copied or stolen.
Additionally, centralized servers with stored credentials can be breached. With this solution, the data is encrypted with strong public key cryptography where only the public key is stored on the RSA SecurID Access service, eliminating risks.
REDUCE IT COSTS
Dramatically reduce the number one IT support cost--password resets--by minimizing dependency on passwords and simplifying credential lifecycle management to reduce complexity and costs for administrators.
By switching to YubiKeys, Google saw the following results.3 · 4x faster logins · 92% fewer IT support calls · Zero account takeovers

EASY TO USE, FAST AND RELIABLE
Users will enjoy a frictionless and consistent experience across applications and can start using the YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access in minutes, with a quick PIN setup and registration process. The solution simplifies self-service and emergency access to increase user productivity. And it is reliable, always on and accessible, because it is water resistant, crush resistant and does not require network connectivity.
EASY TO DEPLOY
IT can deploy YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access in days, not months. SaaS deployment makes it easy and cost-effective for new and existing customers to take advantage of the RSA Identity Assurance platform, which acts as a single source for managing all users and credentials.
ENTERPRISE-GRADE SECURITY AND IDENTITY ASSURANCE FOR DYNAMIC WORKFORCES
The YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access brings best-of-breed modern authentication, risk-based access management and credential lifecycle management together in a powerful solution. It goes beyond traditional multi-factor authentication by using identity insights, threat intelligence and business context.
· Conditional access and risk-based authentication--Simplify policy and decisionmaking, and mitigate advanced threats with invisible layers of protection. Easily set up authentication policies that are intuitively based on low to high levels of risk. Leverage the risk engine--which uses machine-learning algorithms and takes into consideration information about the user's access, device, applications and behavior--for assurance that users are who they claim to be.
· Enterprise-grade credential lifecycle management--Decrease risks and reduce IT time and costs with simplified and secure enrollment, self-service and emergency access, and workflow integration.
· Complete coverage with a consistent user experience--Provide dynamic workforces with a frictionless and consistent user experience across applications.
· Modern Authentication Choice--Leverage the Identity Assurance platform to help manage all authentication options: two-factor authentication (2FA), multifactor authentication (MFA) or mobile MFA; and a variety of authentication methods, including push notifications, SMS, OTP, biometrics, voice and hardware, software and FIDO tokens.
The YubiKey for RSA SecurID Access security key delivers expanded authentication options
· Strong Two-Factor--Password + Authenticator: Adds a second factor for secure two-factor authentication.
· Strong Multi-Factor--Passwordless + PIN: Combines authentication with a PIN, to reduce friction with a simple and secure experience for remote users to access business-critical resources.
