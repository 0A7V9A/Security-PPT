WHY are they effective
Not everyone is able to identify what is true or not. Fact-checking is still a new concept. People tend to believe messages sent from friends / family. Social media tend to promote popular posts, recommend people what their contacts posts

Trend 1: Amplification of Organic Content and Planting of False Content in Legitimate Channels
Dissemination of fabricated communications and correspondence to promote specific political narratives

Trend 2: Inauthentic News Outlets
IO actors will continue to leverage their own inauthentic news sites and produce fabricated news articles aligned with their political interests.
­ Throughout 2018 and 2019, we investigated and reported on a network of inauthentic news sites and associated social media accounts aimed at audiences globally that we believe are of Iranian origin

Trend 3: Use of Public Relations / Marketing firms for IO
We anticipate this trend will continue as actors seek to both further inhibit effective attribution and leverage the expertise of specialists who may be perceived as better understanding the online influence space.
­ Throughout 2018 and 2019, we investigated and reported on a network of inauthentic news sites and associated social media accounts aimed at audiences globally that we believe are of Iranian origin

Trend 4: IO by Non-state actors
Identified a network of suspected inauthentic accounts on Twitter and Facebook promoting content from the news site "The BL" (thebl.com) as well as political material in support of U.S. President Trump.
­ The BL is a news site that maintains pages in English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Vietnamese.
­ We have observed indications that The BL is linked to The Epoch Times and to The Sound of Hope Radio Network, media organizations
­ Open sources have reported as linked to the Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) movement. The practice of Falun Gong has been banned in China since 1999.

Trend 5: Media manipulation and "Deepfakes"
We assess with high confidence that actors will increasingly explore the use of artificial intelligence and "deepfake" technology for their operations through 2020 and beyond.
­ Network of inauthentic accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube
­ Assess with moderate confidence are pushing narratives in support of the Cuban government and critical of the U.S

Legislation from around the world
SINGAPORE
Singapore's new law would require social media sites like Facebook to carry warnings on posts the government deems false and remove comments against the "public interest". Violations could attract fines of up to S$ 1 million ($737,500) and 10 years in prison.
RUSSIA
Last month, President Vladimir Putin signed into law tough new fines for Russians who spread what the authorities regard as fake news or who show "blatant disrespect" for the state online. Authorities may block websites that do not meet requests to remove inaccurate information. Individuals can be fined up to 400,000 rouble ($6,109.44) for circulating false information online that leads to a "mass violation of public order".
FRANCE
France passed two anti-fake news laws last year, to rein in false information during election campaigns following allegations of Russian meddling in the 2017 presidential vote. President Emmanuel Macron vowed to overhaul media laws to fight "fake news" on social media, despite criticism that the move was a risk to civil liberties.
GERMANY
Germany passed a law last year for social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to quickly remove hate speech. Called NetzDG for short, the law is the most ambitious effort by a Western democracy to control what appears on social media. It will enforce online Germany's tough curbs on hate speech, including pro-Nazi ideology, by giving sites a 24-hour deadline to remove banned content or face fines of up to 50 million euros.
MALAYSIA
Malaysia's ousted former government was among the first to adopt a law against fake news, which critics say was used to curb free speech ahead of last year's general elections, which it lost. The new government's bid to deliver on an election promise to repeal the law was blocked by the opposition-led Senate
EUROPEAN UNION
The European Union and authorities worldwide will have to regulate big technology and social media companies to protect citizens, European Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans said last month. EU heads of state will urge governments to share information on threats via a new warning system, launched by the bloc's executive. They will also call for online platforms to do more to remove misleading or illegal content.

Legislation in Singapore
Singapore
­ Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill (POFMA) to prevent the electronic communication of falsehoods (i.e. false statements of fact or misleading information)
­ Safeguard against the use of online platforms for the communication of such falsehoods.
Why was POFMA implemented
Fake news has been an ongoing phenomenon in Singapore. In 2016, a hoax was widely shared about the alleged collapse of a roof at Punggol Waterway Terraces. This false news caused anxiety among residents, and led to the wastage of substantial resources, as grassroots leaders, police and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel had rushed down to the scene over fears of mass casualties.

Impact on businesses operating in Singapore
Ensure all digital content is accurate and factual Temper down expectations around freedom of speech (e.g. US First Amendment). Recognize that in Singapore it is a very different political climate and these rights are being counterbalanced against the need to maintain balance in Singapore If there is a need to publish content or views that is unsubstantiated, label it as such. Provide context and provide opposing views. In the content you create, avoid discussions on sensitive topics along the lines of hate-speech / racial / religious / inclusivity / social progress themes that are likely to create negative sentiment, unless such topics are germane to your business.

What's next?
More countries are coming to perceive IO as an effective weapon, signaling a potential growth in IO activity over the coming months COVID-19 related IO activity is a good indication that current affairs can also lead to IO campaigns by actors seeking to generate certain narratives We assess with high confidence that actors will increasingly explore the use of artificial intelligence and "deepfake" technology for their operations through 2020 and beyond.
