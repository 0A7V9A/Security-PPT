Continuous Compliance & Risk From Continuous Security

Integrated Security Platform

Qualys Unified Compliance & Risk
Map security to compliance
Qualys Platform for unified and continuous security

Continuous Compliance from Continuous Security
Qualys Unified Compliance maps every app's output to compliance requirements

New-age Challenges: Teams Speaking Different Languages

Elastic, Kafka, custom web servers

Identify risk and compliance

Secure hosts, config/integrity/ vulnerability management

Security & Compliance needs should be running with DevOps from the start

Start Compliant, Stay Compliant in DevOps with Qualys PC

Qualys FIM Monitors From CD Phase

PC

FIM

Discover and Assess Technologies with Dynamic Paths
Qualys PC enables automatic discovery and assessment of middleware technologies from host scans
There's no need to create authentication records

CISO Responsibility: Ensure Security Controls are in Place and Functioning https://www.bitsight.com/blog/ciso-roles-and-responsibilities
Is Anti-virus active, updated for signatures, scanning?
Is FIM, EDR agent configured correctly to monitor? Are OS native application protection, memory protection configured?
Need to have Security Control Validation (SCV) in place test and confirm that security tools configured properly on all endpoints

Security Control Validation from Policy Compliance
Anti-virus technologies | Qualys FIM Agent | Splunk | Kafka | Native Malware Protection

Start Gold, Continuously Assess, Remediate

Alert and Incident Management for Authorized vs Unauthorized Changes During Patching

FIM gives context of changes in cloud
