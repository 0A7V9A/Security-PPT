QUALYS SECURITY CONFERENCE 2019
Vulnerability Management Detection & Response (VMDR)
Chris Carlson VP Strategy, Qualys, Inc.

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

Asset Inventory
Do you know what all your assets are and where they are?

Vulnerability Management
Do you know the type and amount of open vulnerabilities?

Patch Management
How can you deploy patches to close high-impact vulnerabilities?

Threat Risk and Prioritization
Can you prioritize remediation based on threat intelligence?

One solution to Discover, Assess, Prioritize and Patch critical vulnerabilities

Asset Discovery
Detect known and unknown assets Workflow to add an unmanaged asset as a managed asset
Asset Inventory
Hardware, operating system, and application inventory for all assets
Asset Normalization and Categorization
Normalize Inventory data by common attributes Categorize by vendor, version, type

Vulnerability Management
Detect vulnerabilities by QID CVE-to-QID mapping CVSSv2 and CVSSv3 base scores
Security Configuration Assessment
CIS Benchmarks Security-related misconfigurations

Prioritization
Using real-time threat intelligence Real-world exploits Proof of Concepts Exploit categorization Exploit severity
Machine Learning
Contextual Awareness

Remediation
Automatically correlate vulnerabilities to patches
End-to-end User Interface workflows
Fit-for-purpose visualizations and recommendations
Orchestration for remediation

Prioritization Engine ­ Machine Learning

Multi-Layer neural network Dataset of 120,000+ vulnerabilities
132 vulnerability features
Live exploits / POCs Historical threat patterns Historical vulnerable software/vendor Dark web and social media references Qualys security researchers Learns new patterns and intelligence daily
