Ironstream®  +  Splunk:  Supplement  ExisIng  Monitors  
 Most  mainframe  monitors  don't  correlate  informaIon   between  systems,  sub--subsystems,  and  applicaIons  well  
 Most  do  not  take  into  account  SYSLOG  messages  or  security   threats  which  can  impact  performance  
 They  require  Subject  Maoer  Experts(SMEs)  with  in  depth   technical  knowledge  for  effecIve  use  
 Most  have  evolved  into  very  complex  and  resource   intensive  soluIons  in  an  aoempt  to  cover  everything
