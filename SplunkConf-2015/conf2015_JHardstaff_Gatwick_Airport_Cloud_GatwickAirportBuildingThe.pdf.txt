The  Dawn  of  RealizaIon  
Compliance  with  SQR  
First  aoempt  with  business  data:   · How  are  we  doing  with  TIP?   · Where  are  passengers  going?   · Are  there  problems  with  travel?  
Splunk  provided:   · Insight  into  security  compliance   · Prepare  security  to  look  for  specific  items   · Understand  road  and  rail  incidents  &  their  effect   · A  combinaIon  of  historical  fact  with  current  event

The  Business  Challenge  

What's  the  Challenge?  

We  needed  to  monitor  
· Radar  --  Zoned,  Finals,  Landed   · Flight  InformaIon  Displays   · Resource  on  Stand   · Stand  Entry  Guidance  System   · Fixed  Electrical  Ground  Power   · Steps  &  Air--bridge  Aoached   · Service  Vehicles  Geo  Tag  &  Fence   · Baggage  ReconciliaIon  System   · People  CounIng  System   · Electronic  Flight  Progress  Strips   · Airport  OperaIonal  Database  ­  Flight  Status

Capacity  and  Flexibility  
Gatwick  Strategy  is  to  uIlize  Cloud  Services    
· Already  subscribe  to  Cloud  Services  
­ OKTA  ­  SSO  &  Mobility  Management   ­ Casper  ­  SituaIonal  Awareness  &  Noise  Tracking   ­ Amadeus  ­  A--CDM  Portal   ­ MicrosoT  Azure  ­  Messaging  Services  
· We  would  need  ~60  dedicated  Splunk  servers   · Associated  support  and  maintenance  costs   · Build  for  heaviest  demand   · Unable  to  flex  up  or  down  as  required   · Unable  to  beat  the  price  point  internally   · Unable  to  beat  100%  availability  internally

Faster  Delivery  to  Business  
We  Needed  to  move  Quickly  
· Splunk>Cloud  was  required  ASAP   · Two  weeks  to  get  data  out   · First  live  dashboard  four  weeks  aTer  that   · SAML2  /  OKTA  presented   · Airfield  status  on  CEO  Apple  Watch  from  Aug  
· Full  control  of  data  consumed   · Deliver  VisualizaIon  in  days  not  weeks   · Combine  Historical  Fact  with  Current  Event   · Predict  impact  and  implicaIon

Conclusion  

What  Now?    
A  ShiT  Change  in  Thinking  
!  Combining  Ops  data  in  Splunk>Cloud  gives  agility  &   scalability,  provides  insight  into  airport  performance  
!  How  did  we  do?  -->  How  are  we  doing?  -->  How  will  we  do?  
!  Simple  method  to  combine  Historical  Fact  with  Current   Event  
!  PredicIon  stops  a  minor  incident  becoming  a  major   problem
