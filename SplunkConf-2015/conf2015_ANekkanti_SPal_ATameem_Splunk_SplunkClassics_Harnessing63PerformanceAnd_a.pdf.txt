   Scheduler  can  not  disFnguish  between  searches  that  (A)  really  should  run  at  a  specific  Fme  (just  like  cron)    
from  those  that  (B)  don't  have  to.  This  can  cause  lag  or  skipping.   Solu0on  in  6.3:    
  
Give  a  schedule  window  to  searches  that  don't  have  to  run  at  specific  Fmes.  
Example:    
   For  a  given  search,  it's  OK  if  it  starts  running  someFme  between  midnight  and  6am,     but  you  don't  really  care  when  specifically.  
и A  search  with  a  window  helps  other  searches.   и Search  windows  should  not  be  used  for  searches  that  run  every  minute.   и Search  windows  must  be  less  than  a  search's  period
