Sell  a  Service  
!  The  tool  is  not  what  you  are   selling  
!  Sell  to  get  funding   !  Sell  to  expand  the  plaYorm   !  Sell  to  help  get  the  full  value  
from  your  investment

Support  Limits  
!  Be  upfront  and  clear  about  limits   !  Do  you  support  Splunk  or  support  the  
service   !  Bigger  team  ­  more  service   !  Team  support  --  Superstar  versus  lowest  
common  denominator

Service  versus  Tool  

!  How  many  of  you   have  a  tool  in   your  company   whose  value  has   been   marginalized?  

IdenJfy  a  need  
The  tool   languishes  

Find  a  tool  

No  one  supports   the  need  

Stand  up  a  team   to  support  the  
tool

Funding  for  the  Service  
!  Why  is  this  important?   !  Who  gets  charged?   !  What  level  in  the  organizaJon  gets  charged?  
­ Too  low  discourages  usage   ­ Chargeback  based  on  costs,  logs  ingested  or  queries  ran?  
!  Funding  for  "keep  the  lights  on"  or  for  "market  differenJator"?
