Visibility  to  Environment  Health  &  User  Exp.  

· Brute  force  approach  providing  visibility  to  key   processes  isn't  working  and  won't  scale  
· OperaDons  sDll  lacks  complete  end--to--end   visibility  to  the  environment's  health,  use  and   trends  
· Blinds  spots  sDll  exist  in  monitoring  and  data   access  for  OperaDons  which  could  help  improve   troubleshooDng  and  upDme  /  availability  
Incident  /  Issue  No:fica:on  
· Brute  force  approach  to  proacDve  monitoring  isn't   working  consistently  and  won't  scale  
· There's  a  "Waterfall  effect"  ­  small  issues  go   without  broader  noDficaDon  triggering  other  issues   eventually  leading  to  a  bigger  incident  
· Users  are  aware  of  issues  before  OperaDons  and   call  the  helpdesk    
· All  the  lights  are  "green"  but  sDll  ~65%  of  incidents   overall  are  reported  first  by  the  business

Reduce  MTTR  with  rapid  root   cause  analysis  

Troubleshoo:ng  Incidents  /  Issues  
· OperaDons  troubleshooDng  is  cumbersome  and   subopDmal  
· It's  sDll  manual  across  IT  silos   · It's  difficult  to  find  root  cause  of  incidents  quickly   · Performance  issues  are  difficult  to  resolve   · Outages  and  impact  are  elongated  due  to  manual  
efforts  and  silos   · Teams  are  distracted  from  their  core  work  when  
they're  troubleshooDng  
Recurring  Incidents  /  Issues  
· The  Problem  Management  process  isn't  working   because  there  are  many  high  severity  incidents   sDll  without  root  cause  determined  
· As  a  result,  OperaDons  is  solving  the  same   problems  again  and  again  
· OpportuniDes  exist  to  improve  on  incident   avoidance  since  @25%+  of  incidents  are  repeats
