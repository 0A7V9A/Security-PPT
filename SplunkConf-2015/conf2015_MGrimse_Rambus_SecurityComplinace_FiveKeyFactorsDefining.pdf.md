The  Problem  

Today's   Board   of   Directors   are   ill--equipped   to   provide   valuable   feedback   to   the   CIO   regarding   cyber   security   risk   management.      The   capability   gap   reduces   a   company's   ability   to   appropriately   manage  and  respond  to  modern  cyber  risks.
