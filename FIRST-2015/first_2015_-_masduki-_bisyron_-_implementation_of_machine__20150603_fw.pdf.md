Detection State of IDS

A legitimate attacks which trigger alarms

True positive

Falsee Positivvee

Alarms are generated, But no attacks have taken place

No attack has taken place and no alarm is raised

True Negative

Falsee Negativvee

A failure of an IDS to detect actual attacks

Intelligence detection engine based on Machine Learning tech
· Machine Learning as second classification engine
· It is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM)
­ It has been proven to be one of the best classification method
­ We have done benchmarking by using data from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). By using 8 features It can give 99% detection rate
