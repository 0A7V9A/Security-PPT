Evolution of Cyber Security and the Cyber Intelligence Problem

Yesterday's Security

Today's Problem

Tomorrow's Solution

? ??

? ??

Network Awareness
Protect the perimeter and patch the holes to keep out threats share knowledge internally.

Intelligence Sharing
Identify and track threats, incorporate knowledge and share what you know manually to trusted others, which Is extremely time consuming and ineffective in
raising the costs to the attackers.

Situational Awareness
Automate sharing ­ develop clearer picture from all observers' input and pro-actively mitigate.

Increasing Cyber Risks
· Malicious actors have become much more sophisticated & money driven.
· Losses to US companies now in the tens of millions; WW hundreds of millions.
· Cyber Risks are now ranked #3 overall corporate risk on Lloyd's 2013 Risk Index.

Manually Sharing Ineffective
· Expensive because it is slow manual process between people.
· Not all cyber intelligence is processed; probably less than 2% overall = high risk.
· No way to enforce cyber intelligence sharing policy = non-compliance.

Solving the Problem
· Security standards recently matured. · Cyber Intelligence Sharing Platform
revolutionizing sharing and utilization of threat intelligence.

Cyber Intelligence Problem
Typical Sharing of Intelligence Today
1. Machines detect threats, typically stored in proprietary formats or PDFs 2. People export data and manually share via multiple media types 3. Other people rarely get a full picture of ongoing threats 4. Only some threats are mitigated

Impediments To Progress
· Trust · isolated into "like" organizations based on similarly perceived threats/business line · Common/Standard rules on handling, marking, controls, and auditing ­ and how do we agree and share them?
· Vendor interoperability · Individual organization with manual processes
· What to share (Metadata, full data, full packet capture) · How to share (anonymous, attributable, what handling caveats,
how to I capture and move the data to the sharing environment) · What to do with the data that I receive (is it actionable) · Simplicity to support small organizations · Shortage of skilled analysts · How to share without tipping off the enemy? · Senior leadership awareness, understanding, and support

Members respond in real time with initial analysis and recommendations

SOC completes analysis, anonymizes the source, and generates alert to general membership

Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)
Restricted to a defined group (e.g., only those present in a meeting.) Information labeled RED should not be shared with anyone outside of the group
AMBER information may be shared with FSISAC members.
GREEN Information may be shared with FSISAC members and partners (e.g., vendors, MSSPs, customers). Information in this category is not to be shared in public forums
WHITE information may be shared freely and is subject to standard copyright rules
Within communities is manageable Across communities is hard and requires
ongoing effort (call to action)

We Don't Need Another Portal*
(* Sung to the tune of Tina Turner's Classic Song from Road Warrior)

Information flows accelerate
· 1,554 installations of Soltra Edge · 12,000,000 indicators in FS-ISAC repository · 10,000 daily requests for information from FS-
ISAC repository · Are we succeeding to death? · How do we prevent automation from becoming
part of the problem?

Common Language(s)
· OASIS CTI
· New International Standard for CyberThreat Intelligence Inter-Exchange
· Based on DHS/MITRE STIX/CybOX/TAXII
· Extension Data Models for OASIS CIQ, CAPEC,MAEC, OpenIOC, OVAL, Snort, Yara, CVRF
· Widely deployed in select communities · Significant momentum in Vendor and
Open Source Communities · Many tools for converting de facto formats
(e.g., CIF, OpenIOC, VERIS)
· Other Emerging Standards
· IETF IODEF · OMG Threat/Risk and SIMF

Cyber Threat Intelligence
Consider These Questions.....

What Activity are we seeing?

Where has this threat been Seen?

What weaknesses does this threat Exploit?

Who is responsible for
this threat?

What Threats should I be
looking for and why?

What does it Do?

Why does it do this?

What can I do?

Making it Actionable
· Rule builder for alerts
· Flexible visualization framework based on splunk for analytics
· Portlet in portal meant for Analysts
· Road map for Campaigns, Actors, TTP's, etc...

Automation Maturity
· Humans will always be in the loop...
...but Analyst Driven Automation will replace many current manual processes
· Using STIX and TAXII gateways (aka OASIS CTI) we can leverage already scarce talent
· Fewer analysts will have to develop their own signatures · Using automation it is possible to move signatures faster · Off the shelf COTS may not interoperate across vendors · Open Source may require in-house development to
automate information flow · But, can you trust Analysts/Incident Handlers in other
organizations?
27

What You Can Do
· Continue working on agreement of handling protocols (TLP, Data Marking)
· Continue working on defining Relevancy to prevent the "firehose" effect · Encourage Cyber Observable/Indicator sharing within your organization · Work within standards that are widely adopted (e.g., OASIS CTI, IODEF) · Don't wait for the perfect solution ­ start now and help mature the process · Engage with working and sharing groups
· Software Supply Chain Assurance · https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/
· Open Web Application Security Project · http://www.owasp.org
· ISAC ­ find one that you fit · SANS/DSHIELD

CRITs
CRITs is an open source malware and threat repository that leverages other open source software to create a unified tool for analysts and security experts engaged in threat defense.
It has been in development since 2010 with one goal in mind: give the security community a flexible and open platform for analyzing and sharing threat data.
CRITs is free and open source, and can provide organizations around the world with the capability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape.
CRITs can be installed locally for a private isolated instance or shared among other trusted organizations as a collaborative defense mechanism.
CRITs support for OASIS CTI TC Standards (aka STIX CybOx, and TAXII) provide the foundations of the DSIE ACIX (Automated Cyber-intelligence InterExchange) Initiatives which will provide "Analyst Driven" Threat Intelligence dissemination to both Human Analysts and emerging Automation Processes that leverage Standards based structured threat intelligence.
