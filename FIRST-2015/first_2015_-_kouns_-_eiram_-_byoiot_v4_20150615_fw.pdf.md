What's IoT?

Internet of Things ­ Who Came Up With The Term?
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Definition?
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Definition (Techopedia.com)
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing concept that describes a future where everyday physical objects will be connected to the Internet and be able to identify themselves to other devices.The term is closely identified with RFID as the method of communication, although it also may include other sensor technologies, wireless technologies or QR codes.
The IoT is significant because an object that can represent itself digitally becomes something greater than the object by itself. No longer does the object relate just to you, but is now connected to surrounding objects and database data.When many objects act in unison, they are known as having "ambient intelligence.""
"The Internet of Things is a difficult concept to define precisely." - Techopedia.com

Internet of Things ­ Definition (Gartner)
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment."
- Gartner
http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/internet-of-things/ NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Definition (Wikipedia)
"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices.
Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure."
- Wikipedia

Internet of Things ­ Definition (Kevin Ashton)
"The fact that I was probably the first person to say "Internet of Things" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. But what I meant, and still mean, is this:Today computers - and, therefore, the Internet - are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information.
If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things - using data they gathered without any help from us - we would be able to track and count everything.
We need to empower computers with their own means of gathering information, so they can see, hear and smell the world for themselves, in all its random glory. RFID and sensor technology enable computers to observe, identify and understand the world - without the limitations of human-entered data."

making without human interaction/control

During a wireless assessment of a client's WiFi network, InGuardians sniffed for ZigBee, Z-wave, and other 900 MHz
traffic common for IoT devices It was found that the building contained a ZigBee network
that the client was not aware of This network supported devices controlling the building's
HVAC system, which put the company's manufacturing process at risk

Internet of Things ­ Where To Start At Your Org?
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Security Needs A Seat!
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Find Your IoT!
· Get an inventory of your current IoT devices
­ Network scanning / mapping - know what software is in use where including IoT devices
­ Look at outgoing web traffic / logs to see what IoT devices are talking outbound
· Know where risk is in your environment
­ Map and track in existing asset management data / CMDBs
­ Ensure you have proper vulnerability intelligence
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ Don't Only Rely On Vuln Scanning
Most organizations ONLY use scanners for managing vulnerabilities
­ Many scanners do not even include IoT checks in their products! Even if they did they can't find some of the issues!
­ Even if they did, it is a much longer Time of Exposure than if you truly know your environment (assets) and map to known vulnerabilities
­ Use scanners as a catch all and to help uncover configuration issues, but know IoT isn't a focus yet!

Implement proper network

segmentation for all IoT

devices where possible

­ Allows for reduction of attack surface

­ Improves incident response ability when devices are clearly indentified

NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ IoT Vendors · Accept devices are going to be connected to the Internet and can
be easily accessed
­ Plan for this and ensure the proper security is in build into the product
· Ensure software / firmware can be updated and actually update it!
­ Do NOT allow "forever day" bugs! ­ Plan for updates, limit the use of embedded components where possible ­ Create an easy to use auto-update features available
· Educate staff on security issues
­ Train developers on secure development ­ Create a process and figure out how to respond when issues are
found/reported ­ Create an Incident Response team and disclosure vulnerabilities
NOT JUST SECURITY , THE RIGHT SECURITY

Internet of Things ­ IoT Vendors (cont) · Implement proper logging and audit history for access and usage · Implement access control for the device, including two factor
authentication options. · Perform source code security audits and product penetration tests · Consider creating a bug bounty program to reward reported
vulnerabilities in products · Understand the 3rd party libraries and code used in the product
­ Select secure libraries from the beginning ­ Monitor for 3rd party vulns and correct.

· IoT is already in your network and more is coming very soon!
· Start talking with your executives about the issues and ensure you are in the loop to conduct the proper risk assessments.
· Inventory IoT and ensure ongoing monitoring · Ensure you incorporate your incident response
program to include IoT products and vendors. · Work with vendors and pick products that
demonstrate they care about security!
