Sector Based Cyber Security Drills Lessons Learnt
Dileepa Lathsara

Background:
 In the past five years, cyber-attacks and threats on corporate IT systems in Sri Lanka is in the rise.
 Many organizations start reacting to security incidents after the fact.  Organizations are lacking experience and expertise to successfully over come
Cyber attacks.

Background:

 Collaborative effort of

and



 Initially introduced to the banking sector

then...

financial

insurance

Telco sector

 The attack scenarios for the drill will be based on the latest cyber-attacks
 Idea and the experience gained from APCERT annual drill

The main objective of the cyber drill exercise
 Train IT and IT Security staff to successfully overcome a cyber-attack  Evaluate the security team's response to cyber-attacks.  Check the contingencies of their IT processes and procedures  Test technical competency in dealing with cyber attacks

The main objective of the cyber drill exercise
 Realization of overall attack and how they handle the situation  Test the communication contact points and internal team communication  How they successfully communicate with the media without affecting
confidentiality  Encourage Coordination and information sharing between trusted
parties/stakeholders to mitigate the attack

About TechCERT Cyber Security Drill
 Simulate scenarios for pre-defined objectives,  Providing necessary stress to players - react to an untold situation within a time
limit.  Role-playing game between the Players and the Drill Control Center D-CON.  Supplies the `injects' according to the predefined timing  Simulated scenario is made as close to reality as possible within safe boundaries  All information may not be given
explicitly. Some may require the player to dig out

Sample Drill Scenario
Sample Drill Scenario

Roles in the Drill
Drill ­ Exercise Control - Declare start/end of drill - Send out injects to Players - Respond to Player responses by acting as different parties (i.e ISP, Attacker, Customer, Media, CEO, IT Team) - Control the progress of drill

Player - Staff of participant organization who respond to security incidents - Should react to the given `Injects' as in daily operations
Role Play
Injects
Communications

Observer - Will NOT participate in drill exercise - Monitor Player's progress - Ensure Player staying on track and meets objective - Document drill process for evaluation

Some lessons cant be taught They simply have to be learned

Description Problems Encountered:

Lessons Learnt

Decide a theme
Deciding the Drill scenarios/Injects

 Participants (Players) are unable to identify the incidents clearly
 Realization of overall attack is difficult / not clear

 Drills should follow current happenings in the cyber security arena
 Possibility of conducting a drill based on the proposed theme needs to be evaluated before the final decision
 Allowing some of the D-CON team members who did not participate in the design to go through all the drill scenarios / injects before the final preparation.
 Joint brainstorming sessions to prepare the high-level drill scenario with all D-CON members
 Sending drill objectives to "Observers" of the participation teams

Description
Drill communication
The Drill Day

Problems Encountered:
 Participants were not familiar with responses expected during the drill
 Some teams' infrastructure was not prepared in the drill time
 Some of the participating teams were not serious
 In reality, time spent on certain incidents is much longer
 Some of the teams were unable to cope with the elements being exercised

Lessons Learnt
 Pre-drill communication test should be a complete rehearsal of the drill
 All the communication mechanisms need to be tested beforehand
 Questionnaire should be designed to ascertain whether the participants are thorough with the guidelines provided during the registration process
 Some parts of the actual incident needs to be communicated at least one or two hours prior to the drill
 Observers ensure that players stay on track and meets objectives
 Keep TechCERT team members on site

Description
Drill and daily operations
Malware Analysis

Problems Encountered:
 Some teams were unable to cope with their day-today tasks
 Malware analysis/log analysis and similar activities take a lot of time
 Teams need to improve their capabilities in this regard.

Lessons Learnt
 Drill should be designed so that teams' normal activities should be carried out undisturbed.
 Sending specific instructions at least a week prior to commencement of the exercise should result in participating teams being ready well ahead of the exercise date.
 Conduct more activities related to malware/log analysis, DF investigations.
 Train and provide them the necessary tools
 The following will be evaluated during such activities: - Whether the team is able to react - How fast a team can react - How accurate the results are

Description Problems Encountered:

Lessons Learnt

Team capabilities are different from sector to sector

 Response to the incidents of some participating teams are fast and accurate while other teams struggle to complete the tasks
 Maintain the same intensity of enthusiasm during the entire drill

 Analyze the responses of the relevant teams for the last drill.
 Maintain different injects / threat information depending on the team's capability.

Resource limitations

 Manpower requirement to conduct national level drills

 Get help from university students (Engineering undergraduates) after training them.

Evaluation report and team performance

 Should not be shared with external parties.

 Drills should not be considered as a competition.
 The teams' performances should not be shared with other teams, as doing otherwise will affect the continuation of the drill.
 But presentation to the Management is a must

Conclusion and Recommendations
 They have realized that they depend a great deal on external partners and organizations (Service providers, ISPs, CERTs) when it comes to cyberattacks.
 Acquiring up-to-date knowledge is very important for all personnel handling information security issues. Therefore, advanced security training for IS team members and basic security training for all IT team members is a must for all sectors.
 Cooperation is very important in successfully handling cyber-attacks. Therefore, all IT security teams should build trusted relationships with relevant stakeholders, including their competitors.

Conclusion and Recommendations
 Feedback shows that all teams stood to benefit by the drill. Many organizations had taken steps to update their incident response strategies based on the evaluation report given.
 Sector-based cyber security drill set the stage for the banking, finance, telco, ISP, insurance, and other participating teams from several sectors to secure their vital information from cyberattacks and took a lead role in securing Sri Lanka's cyberspace.
