Examining CSIRT Effectiveness

CSIRTs can benefit from both technical and non-technical evaluations of effectiveness.

NEEDS · Majority of research focused on technological aspects

APPROACH

· Applied behavioral science approach
· Individual, team, and multiteam system (MTS) levels of CSIRT functions

BENEFITS

· New team approach can be customized to specific CSIRT needs

· Integrates technical and non-technical COMPETITION guidelines and evaluations compared to
existing process and maturity models

Effective CSIRT Performance

· CSIRT performance requires:

Taskwork:
· Detect and respond to incidents
· Triage incoming incidents
· Analyze incidents
· Develop and execute comprehensive solutions

Teamwork: · Solve problems collectively · Assess team performance · Give, seek, and receive task-
clarifying feedback · Active listening skills · Knowledge about team
members' roles

Key Research Observations
· CSIRT work:
· Occurs in complex and quickly changing environments
· Requires effectively managing information and knowledge in a data rich context
· Depends upon collaboration among individuals and teams
13

Key Research Observations
CSIRTs are multilevel
"Yeah. And so there's sort of different levels of success. There's one for your team and you as an individual as well. But then success also gets the other people on board and for them to do what they need to do to fix the issue."
"You're not only communicating between teams; you're communicating with a lot of other people. So, you basically need to know some of the technical terms . . . you will definitely need to know what's being talked about."
14

Key Research Observations
CSIRT work fundamentally involves:
· Information management · Collaboration (arises through individual
initiative)
"There [are] a lot of times where we just like do on the fly meetings where we discuss problems and share ideas and try to find solutions to problems. So ... if somebody gets stuck we usually have a meeting like that and talk about it."
"Well, if I don't feel comfortable like saying yes, this is an incident or no, it is not, I'll literally turn around. I mean, like guys, do you mind looking at this, and giving your input?"
15

Key Research Observations: Data Findings
· Collaborative problem-solving
· Ranked in Top 10 KSAOs by CSIRT professionals · #3 KSAO in focus groups and interviews
16

Key Research Observations
Information sharing: Critical for success
"Basically communications is definitely important, because we work, like we explained, with each other and the other teams and other resources. So often, you've got to be able to communicate. I think that's very important."
17

Key Research Observations: Data Findings
· Strong drive to learn and share information and skill in talking to others ranked #1 and #2 in focus groups and interviews
· Communication skills, collaborative problemsolving, and motivation to work on behalf of the team all ranked in the Top 20 KSAs by CSIRT professionals
18

Key Research Observations
Characteristics of effective CSIRT members: · Attention to detail · Curiosity · Adaptable
"Attention to detail is important with any technical type job . . . correlating events."
"You've got to kind of like to tinker with stuff. I think curiosity is the biggest thing." "We have to be able to be as flexible as the attack and we have to be able to stay at the bleeding edge of current methods of detecting these attacks and handling these intrusions. If we can't do that, then we're dead in the water. The attackers are extremely agile and we have to be as well."
19

Key Research Observations: Data Findings
· Adaptability
· Ranked among Top 15 KSAO by CSIRT professionals
· Top 5 KSAO in focus groups and interviews
· Collaborative problem-solving
· Ranked in Top 10 KSAOs by CSIRT professionals · #3 KSAO in focus groups and interviews
· Types of Curiosity
· Ranked in Top 20 KSAO by CSIRT professionals (#3 and #19)
· #1 Top KSAO in focus groups/interviews
So what does this mean? 20

Research Implications & Strategies
Adaptability
· Adaptive first line analysts can enable teams to perform better
· Increasing team knowledge can enhance the adaptive capacity of teams.
· Focus of team knowledge: Team tasks, team interactions, and task contingencies
Strategies to Enhance Adaptability
· Cross-training · Virtual documentation of task procedures and
contingencies
21

Research Implications & Strategies
Collaborative Problem-Solving
· Team managers should identify when teamwork and collaboration becomes more necessary
· Develop team interaction norms and expectations accordingly
· Training and hiring strategies should target within- and between-team collaboration.
· Consider "countervailing forces" that can arise among teams, and between teams and the MTS
22

Research Implications & Strategies
Strategies to Enhance Collaboration
· Counterfactual thinking (thinking about what "might have been")
· Can increase the amount of unshared or unique information shared among team members and improve decision-making accuracy (Galinsky &
Cray, 2004).
· Devil's Advocacy procedure: each team member advocates for a specific course of action
· Can reduce premature decision-making
23

Research Implications & Strategies
Curiosity
· Includes seeking information, knowledge acquisition, learning, and thinking
· Some positions might involve higher levels of seeking ambiguous information than others
Strategies to Enhance Curiosity
· Hire highly curious individuals · Train individuals to develop information-
seeking skills
24

CSIRTs as Multiteam Systems

· Creating the best CSIRT is not enough

· CSIRTs typically operate as part of multiteam systems

Team 1

Team 2

Team 3

25

CSIRTs as Multiteam Systems

· What are Multiteam Systems?

· Teams interact interdependently

· Teams share a common goal

· Maintain separate team goals

· Members' functions and expertise
· Similar within team · Different across teams

Team 1

· Dispersed teams
· Geographically · Temporally

Team 2

Team 3

CSIRTs as Multiteam Systems
Steady State MTS
Development
·Step 1 ­ I/O Psychologists
· Reviewed data from 14 CSIRTs · Created team task statements and generic MTS structure
diagrams for each CSIRT
·Step 2 ­ Subject Matter Experts
· Independently verified and validated MTS structure · Edited structures accordingly
·Step 3
·Verification with data collected from 6 additional CSIRTs
29

CSIR MTS Steady State Structure
30

CSIRTs as Multiteam Systems
· Remaining Questions
· Is the steady state structure an accurate baseline depiction?
· What changes the structure?
· Incident severity · CSIRT maturity
· What information is missing from the structure?
31

Cognitive Task Analyses
· A type of job analysis
· Primarily for cognitive jobs · Identifies:
· Thought processes · Decision-making skills
· Includes a variety of interview techniques
· Explain process diagrams of decision-making steps · Discuss decisions made in challenging situations · Respond to hypothetical scenarios
32

Cognitive Task Analyses
· Hypothetical scenario
· Frontline analyst in a small shop · Abnormally high network traffic · Outbound traffic going to a ".ru" domain
· Questions
· What do you think is happening? · How confident are you that you
know what's happening? · How would you respond?
33

Cognitive Task Analyses
· People tend to be overconfident · Overconfidence leads to:
· Decreased adaptability · Increased errors
34

Cognitive Task Analyses
· Pre-Mortem Exercise
· Prescriptive hindsight: Anticipatory thinking
· How could someone fail?
· Preliminary Results
· Decreased confidence (often too high) · Increases accuracy
· Applications
· Prompts (e.g., Pop-up box during incidents) · Training exercises
