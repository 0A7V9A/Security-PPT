Security Operations:
Moving to a Narrative-Driven Model
Josh Goldfarb ­ VP, CTO - Americas

229 DAYS
MEDIAN NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE DETECTION

67% OF COMPANIES LEARNED THEY WERE BREACHED FROM AN EXTERNAL ENTITY

100% OF VICTIMS HAD FIREWALLS OR UP-TODATE ANTI-VIRUS SIGNATURES

UNDERSTANDING THE ATTACK
ATTACKERS UTILIZE MULTIPLE VECTORS AND MULTIPLE FLOWS TO COMPLETE THEIR MISSION

CONTINUOUS SECURITY MONITORING

So Many Important Questions

How long have I been under attack?

How many endpoints are infected?

What was the extent of the damage?

What are the Indicators of Compromise?

Challenges: Alert-Driven Detection Model

Challenges

1

Alerts lack context, making accurate and timely detection difficult

2

Forensics technologies lack performance for immediate response

Snapshot, moment in time Limited context, "straw" view One detail, not the whole story
Manual context-building Not timely Precise data extraction challenging

Putting Together the Story: Narrative Driven Security
Did the attack succeed? What else can I learn about the attack?
Endpoint
Where is the attack destined? Do I see artifacts of intrusion?
Network
What does the complete picture look like? What is my exposure?
Forensics

COMPONENTS THAT BUILD THE NARRATIVE
TECHNOLOGY
INTELLIGENCE
EXPERTISE

How?
· Identify risks, goals, and priorities · Identify gaps in telemetry · Develop content · Improve signal-to-noise ratio · Concentrate into unified work queue · Enrich with supporting evidence · Automate common analysis steps · Interleave intelligence · Present the narrative
