Concepts: STIX and TAXII
1. Early and consistent engagement with the private sector, especially critical infrastructure
2. Leverage US Government's position to move the marketplace further, faster than it would otherwise
3. Iterative approach focused on delivering early value and rapid transition to practice
4. Demonstrate value first and then pursue standardization
5. Ensure today's problems are being solved while providing a path for future evolution

Turning Back Time: 2011
· Standards for cybersecurity information sharing in existence were not being used for sharing between communities.
· Standards that were in use emphasized structure for exchange, but not automated operation.
· Standards were also focused on particular types of incidents and/or abuse notifications. · Threat actors, tactics/techniques/procedures (TTPs), campaigns, or courses of action were not easily expressed

Why international standardization?

1. We promised.

Since 2012, every DHS presentation on STIX and

TAXII has stated "transition the specifications to an

international standards body"

2. US law says we should.

National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act

of 1995 directs the use of privately developed,

voluntary standards.

3. It clears up intellectual property concerns.

All work developed in the standards body will be

governed by non-assertion rules.

Why not start in a standards body?

1. You only want to standardize good things.
Not every country's national football team plays in the World Cup ­ not every good idea merits becoming an international standard.
2. Pre-emptively avoid creating conflict
between de facto and de jure standards
X.400 addressing vs. name@domain
3. Standards bodies aren't traditionally "agile" and can crystallize incomplete ideas

Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)

ITU-T

ITU-T produces standards covering all fields of telecommunications. · Study Groups meet in person according to a calendar to develop
Recommendations · X.509 Public Key Encryption, H.323 family of VoIP standards

ISO develops IT standards for the global marketplace.

ISO/IEC

· Participation of 163 national standards bodies · ISO 27001, Information Security Management Systems Requirements

W3C

W3C is the main standards organization for the Web. · Members include universities, governments, companies and individuals · HTML, CSS, XML, SVG, OWL, WSDL, SOAP, XQuery

IETF, part of the Internet Society, develops Internet standards, particularly those that comprise the Internet protocol suite. IETF · No formal voting; members can come from anywhere · ICMP, UDP, TCP, IPv4, IPv6, DNS, SMTP

What is OASIS?
Non-profit consortium founded in 1993
· 5,000+ participants worldwide · 600+ organizations & individuals in 100+ countries · Home of 70+ Technical Committees and eight
independent groups
Broad portfolio of standards:
Security, Privacy, Cloud, M2M, IoT, Content Technologies, Energy, eGov, Legal, Emergency Management, Finance, Big Data, Healthcare, & more
Open, democratic, transparent

OASIS in the international community
The EU classifies OASIS as "one of the top three ICT consortia."
· EU Regulation 1025/2012 allows OASIS specifications to be referenced in public procurement.
· OASIS is a permanent member of EC's European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardization.
· See www.oasis-open.org/liaisons for more.

Why OASIS?

1. Won't have to re-invent wheels: OASIS TCs demonstrated ability to acknowledge previously completed work as the starting point for OASIS standards.
2. OASIS membership looked very similar to the STIX/TAXII community: broader than just vendors of specific technologies; inclusive of NGOs, government bodies and consumer organizations.
3. Standards are provided free-of-charge in perpetuity, and must be verified by multiple Statements of Use.

Lessons Learned Along The Way
1. De facto is not de jure, and the difference matters. 2. Don't expect that people are going to implement
things from documentation. What are the fundamental building blocks people can re-use (like an API)? 3. Evangelize your community. Don't assume the work speaks for itself. 4. Don't assume the choice of how, when or where to standardize is obvious or easy. Seek diverse opinions from SDO veterans and the community.
