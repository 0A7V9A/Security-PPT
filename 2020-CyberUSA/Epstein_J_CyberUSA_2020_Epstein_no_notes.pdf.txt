Why You Should Care About Older Adults Susceptibility to Phishing
Daniela Seabra Oliveira @dseabraoliveira
1. Do younger and older Internet users differ in their susceptibility to phishing ?
2. Which weapon(s) is/are particularly effective? 3. Does effectiveness of weapons vary by age group? 4. Which life domain(s) is/are particularly effective? 5. Does effectiveness of life domains vary by age group?

Linking Offline Stimuli to Online Disclosures: Privacy, Behavior, and Economics
Alessandro Acquisti, Carnegie Mellon University
Human beings are skilled at detecting potential threats in their physical environment: we have developed perceptual systems to assess sensorial stimuli for current, material, physical risks
In cyberspace, those stimuli can be absent, subdued, or deliberately manipulated by antagonistic third parties
Therefore, security and privacy concerns that would normally be activated in the offline world may remain muted, and defense behaviors may be hampered, online
Can the detection of other human beings in a subject's physical proximity elicit privacy concerns and affect that subject's willingness to disclose sensitive personal information, even in absence of objective changes in disclosure risk?

procedural framework for membership and operations. · The IUCRC program is a cross-directorate program involving ENG, CISE, SBE, and GEO.
The Mission
· To contribute to the nation's research infrastructure base by developing long-term partnerships among industry, academe and government
· To leverage NSF funds with industry to support graduate students performing industrially relevant research
· Encouraging the nation's research enterprise to remain competitive through active engagement with academic and industrial leaders throughout the world

IUCRC Fast Facts ­ FY16 Snapshot

· 76 Centers, 211 Universities · 51 ENG Centers · 25 CISE Centers

Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program
· Established by the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-476)
· Focus: Education of technicians for high-tech fields that drive the economy (IT/cybersecurity, biotech, chemical tech, engineering tech, manufacturing, etc.)
· Goals: More technicians, and high-quality technician workforce (quantity, quality)
· Two-year colleges must have leadership role in all projects
· Focus should be on credit-bearing certificate and associate degree programs, not short-term "training"
· Projects should respond to business/industry needs for the workforce
· Partnerships with employers, four-year colleges and universities, and secondary schools are important
· Typical activities in projects:
· Development of materials, labs, courses, curricula, programs (degrees and certificates) · Professional development for faculty · Transfer agreements with four-year colleges/universities · Internships for students · Mentoring other two-year colleges to develop new programs · Secondary school curricula and outreach (students, teachers, counselors, parents) to recruit students into technician
careers
· More information: nsf.gov/ate, atecentral.net, atecenters.org

Innovation Corps (I-Corps)
Accelerating innovations from the laboratory to the market
· Aims to develop and nurture a national innovation ecosystem that builds upon fundamental research to guide the output of scientific discoveries to the development of technologies, products and processes that benefit society.
· NSF-funded researchers are eligible to receive additional support in the form of mentoring and funding through I-Corps.
