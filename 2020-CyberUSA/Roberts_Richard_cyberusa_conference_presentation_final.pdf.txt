Improving Security and Compliance

We can learn a lot from federal IT security compliance regulations:

They provide guidance for asset management
and categorization
They provide frameworks for improving security, implementing security controls, and hardening systems
They provide guidance on encrypting data and
establish privacy standards

Leverage controls and benchmarks from the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
Follow best practices for cybersecurity:

Discover and monitor infrastructure to

Leverage continuous monitoring to

discover potential threats

detect and mitigate suspicious activities

Patch systems/apps and configure networks to manage vulnerabilities

IT Compliance Overview and CIS Controls
· Making Sense of Federal Regulations
· FISMA · FIPS 199 and 200 · RMF · DISA STIGs · HIPAA · PCI DSS · CIS Controls® and CIS BenchmarksTM are global standards and recognized best practices for securing IT systems and data against the most pervasive attacks

@solarwinds 6

FISMA Overview

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is designed to protect the
nation's critical infrastructure:

Provides standards for categorizing IT systems by mission impact (FIPS 199)

Establishes minimum security standards for data and IT systems (FIPS 200)

Establishes baseline security controls and provides guidance for selecting, implementing, and assessing security controls and assuring their effectiveness (SP
800-53)

Requires protection of sensitive data on contractor information
systems (SP 800-171)

Based on FIPS 200 and 800-53--with narrowed scope
and derived details

Asset Discovery

IT Security
· Starts with discovery · Need to know: what we have, where it
is, what it does, and what dependencies it has

Network and Systems Discovery
· Discovery methods and use cases · Setup, naming guidelines, and agents · Monitoring, status, alerting, baselines,
and thresholds

Other Considerations
· Top 10, dashboards, analytics, and sprawl

Implement Strong Security Controls
· Agencies with evidence of strong IT controls are more likely to possess the hallmarks of strong infosec environments1
· Security controls are used to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks
· General controls · Application controls
· Network monitoring and management tools · Requires a deep level of visibility into your organization's IT infrastructure
