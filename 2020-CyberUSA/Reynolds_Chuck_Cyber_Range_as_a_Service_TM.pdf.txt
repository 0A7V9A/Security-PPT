Cyber Range as a ServiceTM (CRaaS)
Creating Lab & Infrastructure as a Service to implement Cyber Range Activities

Agenda
What is a Cyber Range Challenges of delivering a Cyber Range What is Cyber Range as a Service (CRaaS)
How do you deliver CRaaS What is the value of CRaaS

What is a Cyber Range?
Full Stack Automated Lab/Data Center for Hardening IT
· Replicate Production On-Demand
­IT Infrastructure: end to end network, data, storage, security/firewall, end point devices, IoT, including physical, virtual, and cloud resources ­IT Applications: mobile, middleware, back end, etc. ­Test Equipment: Traffic generators, physical layer switching ­Test/Security Tools: Attack scripts, security software, detection software, etc.
· Uses ­ Stakeholders
­Training IT ­ Cyber scenario games with Red Team, Blue Team, White Team, classroom training. online training ­Test Configurations - HW/SW/Firmware Updates, Network configurations ­Simulate new attacks and IT Outages ­Cyber DevOps Support for Security testing and design for security ­PoCs for new equipment, vendors, architectures ­Application Compliance Assessment for Security Reporting

Cyber Range Stakeholders/Tasks

IT Cyber Range Admin

· Spin up virtual/physical resources · Manage IT Infrastructure (Cloud) · Deliver conflict free range · Manage roles/users/domains · Automation Scripts
End User

PEOPLE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

· Ease of access/availability · Ease of use of resources/apps · Real world replication · Catalog of Cyber Ranges · Integration into End User environment

Content Developers ­ Exercise/Train
· Sharing Cyber topologies · Developing reusable content and training · Application/Service Performance · LMS support
Management
· Analysis of performance of Range · Analysis of end user performance · Cycle time for next deployment · Personnel and Process Alignment · Costs

Challenges for Delivering Cyber Ranges
· Support multiple use cases ­ Training, Exercises, Virtual, Physical and Hybrid, DevOps, on-prem/off-prem, multiple clouds, public/private clouds
· Life Cycle Management of a Cyber Range is complex ­ Administration and IT Support is expensive and time consuming ­ IT Fulfillment is complex, End user content constantly changing ­ Support of new technologies and infrastructure (clouds) ­ Keeping your Cyber Range up to date (matching production) ­ Capturing Metrics on the usefulness of the range is difficult (CAPEX and OPEX)
· Fragmented Access and Users ­ Web portal, Scheduling/reserving, managing resource conflicts, accessing resources, no self service
· Reuse of Automation of complex setups and tasks in the Cyber Range ­ Save and Restore, higher quality/repeatability ­ performance
· Others?

Manage the Inventory of your Range
Physical, Virtual, App, Service, Cloud(s)
· Autoload Shells, DCIM integration, asset DB synchronization, etc.
­ Typically fully automated
­ Integrated with business process workflows
· Physical & virtual resources, apps, services, connectivity
· Build your Cyber Range infrastructure from your lab assets

Model IT Blueprints for Cyber Range
· Visual based Drag and drop directly from inventory
· Abstract complexity (pool support) · Set connectivity based on infrastructure · Any Physical, Virtual, Cloud(s), Apps · Model is "Automation Ready" · Replica of your Production IT Infrastructure
with configuration management · Think Live Visio Diagram!

Publish Catalog of Cyber Range Blueprints

· Publish Blueprints Catalogs
­ Save environment as Blueprint, publish for others to use
­ Standardize Cyber Range test beds and cyber training environments as Blueprints for consistent results
· Self-service access to Cyber assets using Blueprints
· Define how Cyber blueprints are consumed by end users
­ Forms / inputs ­ User access / categories / domains

BI & Analytics
Metrics on your Cyber Range
· Analysis for actionable decision making ­ capture usage trends
· Attributes - define meaningful data based on decisions needed
· Usage and utilization · Capturing needed data and
details · Measure usage of resources

Why Cyber Range as a Service
· Increase agility, responsiveness and repeatability ­ Support of new technologies and infrastructure · Clouds, on-prem/off-prem, hybrid, apps, containers, services ­ Automation of provisioning and orchestration ­ Base lining of device/application/service/content
· Lessen administrative burden ­ Implement infrastructure/automation reuse to deliver Cyber Ranges Faster
· Broaden and control use case adoption ­ Easy to consume service catalogs ­ Support domains and roles
· Better utilization of the Cyber Range infrastructure ­ Scheduling and reserving to utilize the infrastructure more efficiently ­ Spin-up/spin-down of resources with scheduling and reserving (Saving power)
· Easier to implement Business Analytics
