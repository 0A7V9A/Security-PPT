WHAT ARE WE ULTIMATELY LOOKING TO ACHIEVE?
INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD
"... IPB is a systematic process of analysing the mission variables of the enemy, terrain, weather and civil considerations in an area of interest to determine their effect on operations."

INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD
There are four main steps: · Define the battlefield environment. · Describe the battlefield's effects. · Evaluate the threat. · Determine threat COAs

FULL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS?

In Layman's Terms
Know yourself and your environment, know the bad guys, know what different compromises
could look like and understand what could alter or influence all of
the above.

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
"The perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the " projection of their status into the near future. This Situation awareness takes place at three distinct stages

Level 1:

Level 2:

Perception of the elements Comprehension of the

Level 3: Projection of the

STEP 1 DETERMINE THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

STEP 3: DETERMINE THE THREAT ACTORS

Step 3: Determine the Threat Actors
Ultimately you want to know; Who, what, where, when, how and why.
But how do you answer that...

Step 3: Determine the Threat Actors ­ Start big (even bigger than this?)
