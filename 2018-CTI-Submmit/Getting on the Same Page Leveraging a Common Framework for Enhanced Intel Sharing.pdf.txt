For Public Distribution

... Because comparison of threat data across models
and users is problematic
Following a common approach helps to:
· Establish a common ontology and enhance informationsharing since it is easier to map unique models to a common standard than to each other (`N-to-1' easier than `N-to-N')
· Characterize and categorize threat activity in a straightforward way that can support multiple missions ranging from strategic decision-making to analysis and cybersecurity measures, and users from generalists to technical experts
· Achieve common situational awareness across organizations

Our Intent
· Began as a construct to enhance data-sharing throughout the US Government
· Facilitate efficient situational awareness based on objective (typically, sensor-derived) data
· Provide a simple, yet flexible, collaborative way of characterizing and categorizing threat activity that supports analysis, seniorlevel decision making, and cybersecurity
· Offer a common approach (`cyber Esperanto')
· Facilitate cyber threat trend and gap analysis, assessment of collection posture
· Support (not replace!) analysis ­ and free the human to spend more time doing analysis

Goals of a Common Approach

· Key Attributes: a model that is hierarchical, structured, transparent and repeatable, tied to explicit definitions
· An optimized cyber threat framework
­ Is focused on empirical and often sensor-derived data; serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis and decision-making
­ Supports analysis and the characterization and categorization of cyber threat information through the use of standardized language
­ Accommodates a wide variety of data sources, threat actors and threat activity
­ Information arranged hierarchically and organized in increasing "layers" of detail
­ Can be tailored or customized to meet individual needs

Ground Rules as we built our approach
· No one's current model is `wrong' · ...And we are not advocating that anyone stop using their
own! · Map your model to the common backbone and tell the rest of
us how you've done it · ...Or use the common backbone and customize it as needed

Common Cyber Threat Framework Current Status
· Used in threat products by multiple US Government agencies and some Allies
· Adoption across the Executive Branch high priority for 2018
· Under consideration by NATO and Asian allies to facilitate a common operating picture and enhance information sharing
· Being taught to new US Government cyber analysts
· Included in curricula and research at multiple universities
· Evolution continues based on use and ongoing outreach to industry, academia, government, and international partners
