What is Information Anarchy?
The increasing volume of information available and the increasing lack of any control over or provenance for it...this condition complicates commanders' abilities to identify and use the best information. (JDP 2-00)

How did we get here?

Information Monarchy
Information is created by and available to those in power.

Information Revolution
Learning increases, more people want access to information.
Information Anarchy
So much information exist, legitimate, illegitimate, and incorrect, that it is difficult to

Information Democracy There are multiple ways to get news, with competition comes the push for ratings.
Social Media
You can say anything you want and pass it as a fact. Seriously, anything. Try it.

INNOCENT MISTAKES
· Mistakes happen, even when research is thorough.
· New information can be introduced.
· Mistakes *should* be corrected when identified.

HYPOTHESIS AS FACTS
· An idea may be valid but needs to be tested
· Rushing to get information out skips testing and validation
· Theories can be misrepresented as facts

PUSHING AN AGENDA
· Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt improves ratings
· Companies looking to increase business and brand
· Support political, economical, religious stances

INTENTIONAL DISINFORMATION
· Conveying false information to an adversary
· Involves active measures ­ fabrication of documents, planting or leaking false information, etc.

How can we identify misinformation?

SOURCING Was there
Where did the information come from? Can you access the source material?
Was a structured analytic method used?

LINGUISTIC METHODS

Words indicating Sourcing (according to, as per, as the
report states)
Words of Uncertainty
(possibly, could, might)

Explanatory Phrases
(because, in fact, therefore)
Retratactors
(however, although, on the other hand)

Disinformation

Integrative Complexity
A scoring system for measuring the complexity of human thought on a scale from 1 (very simply) to 7 (very complex). It looks at structure instead of content.

Integrative Complexity
The capacity to identify that there is more than one way to look at an issue (differentiation)
The ability to form conceptual links among these perspectives and to integrate them into a coherent overall judgment (integration)

Complexity Analysis

Be wary of words like "always" and "never"

Look for counterpoints or arguments to be preemptively
addressed

Look for synthesis of multiple data sources or analytic methods

Look for complexity across the entire text, not just in the author's area of expertise
