"no country should conduct or support ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors. All states in ensuring the secure use of ICTs, should respect and protect the principles of freedom from unlawful and arbitrary interference of privacy, including in the context of digital communications."

Lessons Learned
Sustain
· Using SATs (ACH) ­ helped make analysis more deliberate · Interact directly with the business/customers · Conduct follow-up w/ attendees upon their return · Work closely with various cyber threat intel providers
Improve
· Begin the analysis and discussion with business earlier · Identify assumptions early on · Leverage sharing communities to validate analysis and increase potential data sources
· Consider the geopolitical situation ­ non-cyber, strategic analysis ­ better indicator of cyber attacks
