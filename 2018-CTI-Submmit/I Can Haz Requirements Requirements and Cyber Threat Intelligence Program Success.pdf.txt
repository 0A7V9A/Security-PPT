I CAN HAZ REQUIREMENTS?
Requirements and CTI Program Success

About Me

Search your feelings... ...you know it to be true!

Why do we need requirements?
Answer critical questions intelligence customers care about
Not what you care about

Intel requirements help you: Scope deliverables Prioritize collection
Identify needed data sources Get ahead of the adversary

Dissemination and
Integration

Planning And
Requirements

Analysis and
Production

Collection

Processing and
Exploitation

Without this

You can't do the rest

Let's make them together!

Identify all the stakeholders and customers who need intel support

C-Suite (Hi CISO!) Board of Directors
Policy folks

What is an intelligence requirement?

"Any subject, general or specific, upon which there is a need for the collection of information, or the production of intelligence." DOD Joint Pub 2-0

What makes a good intelligence requirement?

Four things!
Timeliness Aids ONE decision Asks ONE question Focuses on ONE activity/event/thing

Now for a A decision can be inaction!

Where do I start?

How?

But seriously... Who?

Why?

What?

When? Where?

Use your attack surface. Model the threat.
If you haven't done it, do it.

Something something supply chain something something.

Where in the world is Carmen...I mean you?

What stuff do you have that they want?

TLDR? Requirements are enduring questions consumers of intelligence
need answers to

What do you do when someone
reacts to something in the
news?

The RFI Process!

Helps CTI shops manage ad-hoc intelligence needs not met by standing requirements

Without one, your team can get flooded with
noise

Work with customer on scoping expected deliverable

What do they need? When? Format?
What does it help support?

How can I track RFIs?
Excel (sorry) Sharepoint Workflow (less sorry?)
Email

So I have requirements... ...now what?

Metrics! Please don't be like...

Metrics are often the hardest thing for CTI shops to create

You can:
Show number of products created aligned to numbered requirements
(Throw in RFI's answered too)

You can:
Show customers where production is strongest, weakest

You can:
Identify collection/capability gaps (Not just intel specific!)

To say what I said:
Requirements help align internal, external data sources and capabilities to specific
needs

Shows where current capabilities are lacking, drives collection capability
acquisition

Sets expectation of what your team is producing, when they're producing, and for
whom

Takeaways:
If you're not doing this now, start the conversation
(Try to) make it a team sport
Do what we preach
