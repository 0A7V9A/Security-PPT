Docker  and  the   Three  Ways
7

The  First  Way:   Systems  Thinking
8

Left  to  Right  Flow

· Variety

· Determine your variety of offerings based

on operational efficiency and market

demand
· Velocity

· Maintain a steady flow through all

processes of the supply chain
· Variability

· Manage inconsistencies carefully to

reduce cost and improve quality
· Visibility

· Ensure the transparency of all processes

to enable continuous learning and

improvement

9

Left  to  Right  Flow
· Variety

· Lean Startup

· Minimal Viable Product

· Build Measure Learn

· Customer Development

Methodology

10

Left  to  Right  Flow
· Velocity
· Developer Flow
· Integration Flow
· Deployment Flow
11

Left  to  Right  Flow
· Variation
· Converged Isolation
· Immutable Infrastructure
· Immutable Delivery 12

Order  Matters
"The least-cost way to ensure that the behavior of any two hosts will remain completely identical is always to implement the same changes in the same order on both
hosts."
13

Management  Methods
· Divergence · Convergence · Congruence
14

Left  to  Right  Flow · Visibility
· Containerization
· Microservices
· Data Gravity
15

Case  Study
16

The  Second  Way: Amplify  Feedback   Loops  
17

Right  to  Left  Flow · Variety
· Velocity
· Variation
· Visualization
18

The   Third  Way:   Culture   of  Continuous   Experimentation
and   Learnings

More  Case  Studies

· Capital One

· Analytics and Sports

· Containers as a

Service

Faster,  Cheaper  Safer
· Agile, Lean and Rugged · You Build it you Run it · Change One Thing at a Time · Fail Early Fail Often · Developer Defined
