· Publicly available research on zero-day vulnerabilities and their exploits is sparse
· Common questions include: ­ Life Status: Is a zero-day vulnerability known by others? ­ Longevity: How long will a zero-day vulnerability remain undiscovered
and undisclosed to the public?
­ Collision Rate: What is the percentage of vulnerabilities independently
discovered and disclosed in a given time period?
· Answers can help inform decision makers regarding zero-days · This research provides empirical analysis of zero-day
vulnerabilities and their exploits

Other observations about the data

· 4% of the vulnerabilities in the dataset were purchased from an outside 3rd party

· Not all vulnerabilities were exploited

· CVEs do not always provide accurate and complete information about the severity of a vulnerability

· Virtual isolation (hypervisors or VMs) and anti-virus are not necessarily viable mitigations

· Other observations ...

Data Research Focus Analysis & Findings Implications & Next Steps
Exploit Development time is relatively short
Over 70% of exploits are developed in a month (31 days) or less 11

Data Research Focus Analysis & Findings Implications & Next Steps
Mitigations have affected exploitability (ex: heap vs stack overflow)
Mitigations introduced c. 2007 caused a shift in type of buffer overflow explo1i2ted

Data Research Focus Analysis & Findings Implications & Next Steps
Exploit development career lengths vary
Low hanging fruit may account for a higher number of exploits developed earl1y3 on

Caveats on the data
· Results from our data can be generalized only to similar datasets
· We are comparing private data to public data (ideal would be comparing multiple private datasets)

day vulnerabilities in their own products and products of their customers - Bug Hunters looking for zero-day vulnerabilities, often for bug bounty payouts - Zero-day subscription feed businesses - Other organizations like Project Zero

Collision Rate

· We do not know what is going to happen to those vulnerabilities that are still currently alive
· Calculating short life, long life, and average lifetimes requires taking into account alive vulnerabilities

· Kaplan-Meier analysis estimates the probability of surviving from some event of interest over time
· Ex: For humans, the probability of someone having a heart attack · For vulnerabilities, the probability of dying and becoming publicly
known

Longevity

Collision Rate

· Choose a time interval (365 days, 90 days, 30 days, etc.)

· Over that time interval, new zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and retained

· At the end of the time interval, examine how many have

been found by others and publicly disclosed (i.e. died)
­ "Throw out" those that have died

­ Keep the ones that are still alive

­ Continue to discover and retain new ones until the end of the next time interval when re-evaluation begins again

· Collision rate: median percentage of those that died over all

the time intervals

More research is needed to refine other analysis
· Characteristics of a vulnerability that indicate a long or short life* · Average life expectancies based on vulnerability characteristic* · Life expectancy variation based on birth year · Collision rate variation based on vulnerability characteristic* · Collision rate and timing for individual vulnerabilities · Time to develop exploit based on vulnerability characteristic * · Seasonality of vulnerability research · Cost of developing an exploit
*No statistical significance found, likely due to limited data

life expectancy

Data Research Focus Analysis & Findings Implications & Next Steps
Implications of key findings and recommendations

For those defensively focused
· Refine tactical approaches:
· Analyze previous versions of code that are still in heavy use (e.g., ICS)
· Harness techniques of how offense finds vulnerabilities
· Seek better options to detect vulns
· Consider strategic approaches: mitigation, containment, accountability, and a robust infrastructure of patching
· Employ physical isolation · Account for software, devices, and
removable media · Incentivize upgrading to new versions

For those offensively focused
· Retain a few vulnerabilities per particular software package
· Consider immortal or code-refactored vulnerabilities for operations
· Regularly revisit vulnerabilities thought to be unexploitable
· Plan for a specific vulnerability only for short-term planning operations; expand to any vulnerability may extend the timeline

Data Research Focus Analysis & Findings Implications & Next Steps
Our findings can help inform retention v. disclosure discussions

Pro retention

Pro disclosure

· Long average lifetimes and relatively low collision rates may indicate that:
1. vulnerabilities are dense
· The level of protection from disclosing a vulnerability may be modest
2. vulnerabilities are hard to find
· There is a small probability of re-discovery by others

· Collision rates for zero-day vulnerabilities are non-zero
· A non-zero probability (no matter how small) that someone else will find the same zero-day vulnerability may be too risky
