What is DMP?  
Mark Miller, SVP CRM Practice Lead, Digitas
"The heart of any DMP solution is the ability to link data in ways that provide insights you didn't have before, especially with the linkage of online behavioral data with personal information. These insights should enable you to engage with customers in new and unique ways.
The best DMP providers can help marketers better understand their customers' evolving brand preferences, purchase intents, and interests. Their solutions support better segmentation, better content, relevant messaging, and offers behind acquisition and cross-sell/up-sell efforts.
