Joint Work with Weiyuan Chen and Hongyuan Zha

Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)
IPTV: Deliver television services using the Internet. Video on demand (VoD): Users select and watch video on demand.

Modeling User Behavior in IPTV
Characterizing and modeling the user activities in an IPTV network
· Improve the IPTV system efficiency, e.g. channel switching
· Recommender systems, e.g. program recommendation, personalized EPG, targeted advertisement

Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA is a generative probabilistic model originally proposed for a corpus. The basic idea is that the documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where a topic is characterized by a distribution over words. In the IPTV case, user behaviors are represented as random mixtures over latent interests, where an interest is characterized by a distribution over programs.

Characteristics of IPTV data
A family has one or several members. Each member can have a diverse set of interests. The interests of members may be different. Each member tends to watch TV at certain time periods every week, resulting in temporal viewing patterns.
Challenge: How to tell who is watching in a family
e.g. Do not want to recommend adult content when kids are watching and vise versa

Behavior Pattern: When a family likes to watch what kind of TV shows.

LDA vs cLDAInterests Discovered

Dominated interests: the interest dominated by less than 10 TV shows. The dominated interests tend to group irrelevant TVs together.

LDA generates 9 dominated interests, the cLDA generate 5 dominated interests.

cLDA generates more coherence interests than LDA.

Case Analysis
Examine the behavior patterns generated by cLDA for a family that mainly watches cartoon.
Cartoon's Watching Time of the Family

Case Analysis
 The patterns generated by cLDA successfully tells that the family likes to watch cartoons at 9 to 12AM.

Program Recommendation
Task: Predict what the TV program the family would choose when they turn on their TV at a certain time. Procedure:
· First train a cLDA model using the fully observed set of families (the test data is excluded).
· For test families, we are shown all but the activities of the entire last day.
· We are told when each of the held-out activities occurs. · Predict what TV-program the family would have chosen at the
given time.

Program Recommendation
The number of interests for each model ranges from 5 to 50. Evaluation Metric: Predictive Perplexity
Predictive-perplexity
A lower perplexity score indicates a better generalization performance

Conclusion
Proposed a coupled LDA model to mine the behavior patterns of IPTV users
Individual's interests are time-depdent
The coupled LDA model is also applicable to many other scenarios
