So, 2020
· It's a thing, right?
· Travel cancelled · In-person events cancelled · Budgets slashed · Lots of uncertainty about 2020-2021

As we start to reopen

No guarantees on future lockdowns
Vulnerable and global colleagues may defer travel
Many companies have no travel / limited training budgets
Virtual events are more important than ever before!

But virtual events were always important!

· We just didn't notice if we weren't impacted by: · Family care issues · Budget restrictions · Travel restrictions · Time restrictions ·...

The Bottom Line

· Virtual and hybrid live-virtual events are important
· We should take what we've learned from the COVID-19 crisis and use it to enable and improve them

I ran a free virtual con...

· The first week of lockdowns, I organized "PancakesCon" in one week
· Full day security conference with two tracks
· 7 volunteers
· Next to zero budget
· ~5000 virtual attendees and viewers
· Some things went well, others didn't
· We learned a lot

I attended a bunch of virtual cons!
· Commercial and Community · Migrated and Virtual-Only · Many platforms and technologies · Some things worked, some things didn't · We're all learning as we go...

So... what have we learned?

Let's break it down:
Strategy (why, how, who, when?)
Logistics (organizational and resource hurdles) Tactics (technical and operational details and gotchas)

Strategic Issues
· We don't know what our event want to be when it grows up... · Who is our audience? · What are our objectives in holding this event? · What is the timeframe for our event? · Is our event entirely virtual, or hybrid?

Strategic Solutions
· Create an overarching theme and purpose for the event
Create
· Determine if the event will be full virtual or hybrid
Determine
· Clearly identify objectives and how we will measure success
Identify
· Identify the target audience (demographics, needs, and backgrounds)
Identify
· Propose a time and set clear milestones and touchpoints
Propose
Decideand · Decide and specify who stakeholders and decisionmakers are specify

Logistical Issues
1. Inadequate (or surplus) human or technical resources 2. Inadequate budget for essential expenses 3. Inadequate reach (speakers, sponsors, or attendees) 4. Inadequate platform for broadcast and recording 5. Inadequate platform for social engagement 6. Inadequate moderation and facilitation 7. No plan to close the resource gap in time

Logistical Solutions
Identify and confirm available human resources Identify and confirm available technical resources (and limitations) Calculate target / projected budget (ticket sales / sponsors?) Identify channels and timeframes to reach speakers and attendees Evaluate technologies for broadcast / recording and weigh pros / cons / cost Evaluate technologies for interaction and weigh pros / cons / cost Clearly identify who has skills, desire, and availability to moderate Quantify human, financial, and technology resource gaps

Tactical Issues
1. Failing to note differences between remote and in person audience 2. Failing to grab and maintain audience attention 3. Failures in moderation (talks run over, muting, trolls, poor Q&A,
unclear directions) 4. A/V issues (compatibility, crashes, bad sound, bad lighting...) 5. Weak presentations in remote format 6. No-shows 7. Lack of organic social and networking opportunities

Tactical Solutions

Recognize Develop

Recognize differences in attention spans, stress, and distractions

Develop specific plan for talk and social moderation

Identify
Identify expertise required for expected A/V quality ­ virtual is not "easier"

Prepare
Prepare presenters for virtual platform and speaking
· - Interaction · - Seated vs.
Standing · - Lighting and
appearance

Develop
Develop a policy for cancellations and stand-in speakers

Facilitate
Artificially facilitate organic social interaction (Q&A, prompts, chat)

But what if we have no budget?
· Strategy may need to be adjusted ­ be realistic · Look into available free or low-cost resources · Value and credit your volunteers · Look into sharing resources with another conference · Look into sponsorships, but know what they entail · Biggest expense we found was a broadcast platform · Needs remain, but manage expectations

Where Did We Go Awry?
· Tactics: we weren't fully prepared for a last-minute cancellation · Tactics: speakers had two significant A/V issues that weren't caught in
the green room · Logistics: We should have better planned for the audience size expected
and the available broadcast platform · Logistics: We didn't have a good plan or necessary skillsets available to
record and post our talks

What Went Well
· Strategy was good · The time crunch was worth it · Mixed format was a good idea · Being adaptable was very important · Good speaker logistics were hard work but
integral (green room, etc) · Clearly communicating with speakers and
volunteers was crucial

Cool Problem-Solving from the Community

· Infosec Oasis added interaction by encouraging VR use
· Cons used popular social gaming platforms
· CTFs and villages add to programming
· Re-broadcasts reach a wider audience (with limitations)
· Conference apps are adding useful (and free) functionality like breakout rooms
· Providing opportunities for people to be heard and recognized is super-helpful!

This is hard, why should I run one?

· Cybersecurity audience reach is unprecedented
· Many people were excluded from in-person events
· Many more will be now
· It is doable!
