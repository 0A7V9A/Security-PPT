What is MITRE ATT&CKTM?
 "MITRE"
 ^^ a not-for-profit, federally funded, R&D shop.
 "ATT&CK"
 ^^ matrices (read: "grids") of Threat Actor behaviors.  i.e. a framework of Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP's) and their ID's.
 "Threat Actor"
 ^^ adversaries seen in the cybersecurity industry.

There are multiple ATT&CK Matrix's ... Matrixes ... Matricieses ...

The "Do's" and "Don'ts"

@Adam_Mashinchi

15

[DO]

use it as a "Common Language"

@Adam_Mashinchi

16

[DON'T] make ATT&CK a checklist OR focus on coverage

"But as you examine each technique, you realize there is a seemingly infinite universe of possibilities or variations within many techniques in the matrix.
You might think you have a technique fully covered, but then some researcher will publish something on Twitter, and you'll have to go and add to an existing detection."

@Adam_Mashinchi

17

[DO]

seek Behavior, not Signatures ...

T1124  "System Time Discovery" APT123 v1:

$ net time \hostname "^^ using `net.exe' must be bad!" APT123 v2:

$ powershell Get-Date

@Adam_Mashinchi

18

[DO]

think Periodic Table for

Adversaries

 Chemical Makeup of Threat Actor:
 Context  Order  State
 TTP's
 Individually  inert objections

@Adam_Mashinchi

19

[DO]

use examples as a foundation ...

 Find easy ways to test (adversarial) behavior.  Example: CALDERA
 (by MITRE!)  Open source  Creates Agents  Fires series of commands
 Goal of (any) Tool:
 make validation trivial.
 Canned playbooks as baseline.

@Adam_Mashinchi

20

[DON'T] assume TTP's == Threat Actor
 Threat/TTP's are nuanced
 ... tricky to replicate with most tools.
 Beware false sense of security
 ... think tested against APT XYZ,  tests often vary from intel.
 TTP concepts != implementation
 ... could mean defenses/validations weren't applicable.

@Adam_Mashinchi

21

[DO]

the Game of Minesweeper

An attacker perspective:
 ... you don't know when you've tripped a detective control.
 Compromise is only the first box; time is ticking.

[DON'T] Copy & Paste & <ENTER> (cont.)
WAT?!?

@Adam_Mashinchi

25

[DON'T] forget, 1 Technique != 1 Command
 Techniques may have many procedures for how an adversary could implement it.
 Adversaries are always changing.  Detecting behavior can:
 rely on individual procedures,  span multiple procedures,  span entire technique.

@Adam_Mashinchi

26

[DON'T] forget other standards ...
 Many frameworks:
 NIST Five Functions, Cyber Defense Matrix, etc.
 Your priority informed by:
 the systems that you use,  the data you possess,  and the threats associated with each.
 Models not intended to be bingo cards.

@Adam_Mashinchi

27

To Summarize:
ATT&CK is a framework.

Use it as a ...
 common language for TTP's.  baseline for behaviors.  opportunity to get involved!

Overview of Sub-Techniques

 In Beta: March 31, `20

 ETA: July 8, `20

 Techniques ID's (T4321)

 + dot-notation (T4321.005)

 Remapped some TID's

 Example: T1081 -> T1552.001

 T1081? -> it's gone

 Deprecated some TID's
 Example: T1175 -> null

(Pictured Above: T1175)

 Changed some names

 "Remote File Copy" -> "Ingress Tool Transfer"

Made ATT&CK Navigation... Tricky

@Adam_Mashinchi

36

Speaking of Navigat(ion, or)!

@Adam_Mashinchi

37

Don't Fear the Navigator

Layer Creation FTW!

Homework:
 Try out some scoring...
 ... and research TID's!
 Extra Credit:
 ... use Sub-Techniques!

The End.
