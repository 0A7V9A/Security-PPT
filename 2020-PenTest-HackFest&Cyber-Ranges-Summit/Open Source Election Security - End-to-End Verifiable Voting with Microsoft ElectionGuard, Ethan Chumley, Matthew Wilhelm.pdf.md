Cyber-enabled Threats to Democracy Continue

Our Challenge: Protect the Integrity of Elections
· Paper vs. Electronic · Security vs. Accessibility · Recently: In-person vs. Mail-In
· Ensuring that the integrity of the vote ­ that the official tally represents each voter's intent ­ is paramount
· Our design principles: · Highly secure, highly vetted · Respect voter privacy and secrecy · End-to-end verifiable · Auditable

What is End-to-End Verifiability?
End-to-End (E2E) Verifiability aims to answer the question:
How can I trust the accuracy of an election outcome ... if I think there could be a compromise in the software, hardware, or personnel responsible for conducting the election?

What is End-to-End Verifiability?
An election is end-to-end verifiable if: 1. Voters can verify that their own selections have been
correctly recorded 2. Anyone can verify that all the recorded votes have
been correctly tallied.
An election is secret-ballot if nobody is able to know the ballot selections of a specific voter

Introducing: ElectionGuard
Open Source End-to-End Verifiable Election SDK
Supports any election style (so long as there's an electronic component)

Key Ceremony

Homomorphic Encryption

· Unique encryption keys generated for each election
· Multiple election "guardians" split and hold parts of the keys offline (eg: hardware key, Smartcard)

· Each ballot is homomorphically encrypted.
· Unencrypted individual ballots are never stored or processed.

Tally
· Homomorphic tally allows final results to be calculated without violating voter secrecy or decrypting individual ballots
· Quorum of election officials must be present to do decryption

Public Verification
· Each voter given a unique Tracking ID
· All encrypted election records are publicly published following an election- allows watchdogs to verify the tally and verify no tampering using mathematical proofs

Homomorphic Encryption 101
In "Traditional" Static Encryption (eg: AES), the only thing you can do with encrypted data is decrypt it.

However, some modern encryption methods allow for useful computations on encrypted data, such as basic addition, without the need for decryption.

Using homomorphic encryption in an elections context allows us to tally (add) individual encrypted votes to get an encrypted sum total. We can then decrypt only the encrypted total without the need to violate ballot secrecy and ever decrypt any one particular ballot.

Code Sample

Encrypted Ballot Output

The output format is the same structure as the input format, but now encrypted
The Proofs are key: "Zero-Knowledge Proofs" are a cryptographic assurance that math was done correctly, without revealing secret values
A proof is generated for each contest that ensures: · A "1" (a single vote) or "0" (no
selection) was entered for each selection · A voter made no more than the maximum number of allowed selections

Independent Verifiers
When results are published, anyone can review the encrypted data, verify the proofs for the entire election, and determine if the data is mathematically correct and was not tampered with
Individuals can check their unique Tracking ID (a hash representation of their encrypted vote) to ensure their vote is included in the final tally once and only once, without revealing their selections

· In partnership with VotingWorks, a nonprofit elections system vendor
· ElectionGuard acted as a parallel backup tally system to a hand count
