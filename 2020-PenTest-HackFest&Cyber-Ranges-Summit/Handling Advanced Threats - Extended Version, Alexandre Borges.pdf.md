 INTRODUCTION
 During reverse engineering of a malware sample, we need to understand few aspects on the threat:
 Is the malware packed?  Are DLLs and functions resolved dynamically?  Are strings encrypted?  Are there any anti-forensic techniques such as anti-vm, anti-
debugging or anti-disassembly?  Is there any obfuscation technique being used?
 Unpacking malware is usually easy, but you might find sophisticated packers...

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 INTRODUCTION
 Advanced threats are different from any daily malware because:
 They don't use common packers.  Most of the time, they bring malicious device drives (rootkits).  Sometimes they try to compromise the platform (bootkits)  They can use 0-days to exploit the infrastructure and systems.  They bypass most of defenses and run under the radar.  C2 transmits beacons and data once per week with short duration.  They might implement tricks to prevent any memory acquisition.  Most certainly, there'll be anti-forensic techniques.  It's hard and take so much time to reverse it.
 If you have luck, so you'll have the opportunity to analyze them.  6

 INTRODUCTION
 There're many packers that we know about to unpack them or, at least, how to manage them (but it can be hard...):
 Native code: ASPack, Armadillo, Petite, FSG, UPX, MPRESS, NSPack, PECompact, WinUnpack and so on...
 .NET packers and obfuscators: .NET Reactor, Salamander .NET Obfuscator, Dotfuscator, Smart Assembly, CryptoObfuscator for .NET, Agile, ArmDot, babelfor.NET, Eazfuscator.NET, Spice.Net, Skater.NET, VM Protect 3.40+ and so on...
 Android Packers/Obfuscators: DexGuard, DexProtect, DevGuard, Arxan, ApkGyard, and so on...

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 INTRODUCTION
 .NET packers use similar tricks of native code:
 Control flow obfuscation and dead/junk code insertion.  Renaming: methods signatures, fields, methods implementation,
namespaces, metadata and external references.  Re-encoding: changing printable to unprintable characters  Simple encryption of methods and strings.  Cross reference obfuscation.
 In native code, there're well know memory APIs: VirtualAlloc/Ex( ), HeapCreate( ) / RtlCreateHeap( ), HeapReAlloc( ), GlobalAlloc( ), RtlAllocateHeap( )

 Most packed binaries can be unpacked using debuggers, breakpoints and dumping unpacked content from memory.
 Even when a binary uses customized packing techniques, it is still possible:

 INTRODUCTION
 Of course, we could try to improve and automatize the de-obfuscation of all functions names by using:
 IDA Python: using IDA Python you can de-obfuscated function names and save them into the idb.
 IDC: it's a bit more complicated, but very powerful.
 If your time is short, so you could try emulation tools such as Floss (https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss) to decode possible obfuscated strings and create an IDA script to decorate the reversed code:
 floss --no-static-strings -x malware.bin --ida=floss_ida.py

 IDA Python is ALWAYS very handy and we can use IDA Pro SDK to write plugins for:
 extending the IDA Pro functionalities  analyzing piece of obsfuscated code and data flow  automatizing unpacking of strange malicious files  decoding and loading encrypted / modified MBRs
 It is quick to create a simple IDA Pro plugin.
 Download the IDA SDK from https://www.hexrays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml (likely, you will need a professional account).
 Copy it to a folder (idasdk695/) within the IDA Pro installation directory. 23

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Advanced threats don't use standard tricks and there're many lots of facts about them:
 They use similar techniques from modern packers such as Themida, Arxan, Agile .NET, Tigress, Obfuscator-LLVM and so on.
 Most of them are focused on 64-bit code.
 Obviously, almost all functions are removed from IAT. Remember that Themida packer usually keeps only TlsSetValue( ).
 String encryption is also a common technique.
32
HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Advanced threats are concerned to integrity:
 They protect and check the memory integrity.
 Thus, it is not possible to dump a clean executable from the memory (using Volatility, for example) because original instructions are not completely decoded in the memory.
 There could be checksum functions verifing the integrity of the code itself. Therefore, any attempt of changing the code may break it up.
 Additionally, advanced threats may use watermark to control the "ownership". This is the same technique used to program copyright. 
33
HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Many additional techniques are used:
 There are also fake push instructions.
 There are many dead and useless pieces of code.
 There is some code reordering using unconditional jumps.
 All obfuscators use code flattening.
 Packers have few anti-debugger and anti-vm tricks. Weird anti-vm methods based on temperature, for example.

 ANTI-REVERSING
Remember: obfuscating is transforming a code from A to B by using different techniques (including virtualization).
What're the transition points from native code to virtualized code and vice-versa?

Prologues and epilogues from each function could not be virtualized. Take care. 

Have you tried to open an advanced packer in IDA Pro? First sight: only red and grey blocks (non-functions and data). 

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

37

 ANTI-REVERSING

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 In few cases the VM handlers come from data blocks.

 Original code section could be "splitted" and "scattered" around the program. In this case, data and instructions are mixed in the binary, without having just one instruction block.

 Instructions which reference imported functions could have been either zeroed or replaced by NOP. 

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

 Most certainly, they will be restored (re-
inserted) dynamically by the packer later.
38

 ANTI-REVERSING
 If references are not zeroed, so they are usually translated to short jumps using RVA, for the same import address ("IAT obfuscation") 

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 API names could be hashed (as used in shellcodes). 

 Custom packers usually don't virtualize all native (x86/x64) instructions.

 There's a mix between virtualized, native instructions and data after the packing procedure.

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

39

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Native APIs could be redirected to stub code (proxy), which forwards the call to (copied) native DLLs (from the respective APIs).

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 The "hidden" function code could be copied (memcpy( )) to memory allocated by VirtualAlloc( )  Of course, there must be a fixup in the code to get these instructions.

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

40

 ANTI-REVERSING

 By the way, how many virtualized instructions exist in the binary?

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 It is recommended to try to find handlers to native x86 instructions (non-virtualized instruction)

 Try to classify virtualized instructions in groups according to operands and their purpose such as memory access, conditional/unconditional jumps, arithmetic, general...

 Try to understand the size of virtualized instructions which we might fit into a structure that represents encryption key, data, RVA (location), opcode (type) and so on.

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

41

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Pay attention to instruction's stem to put similar classes of instructions together as, for example, jump instructions, direct calls, indirect calls and so on.
 Find the transition instructions from native mode to virtualized mode and vice versa.
 Find similarity between virtualized instructions and x86 instructions.

 x86 instructions are also kept encrypted and compressed together with the virtualized instructions.

 ANTI-REVERSING

 Constant unfolding: technique used by obfuscators to replace a contant by a bunch of code that produces the same resulting constant's value.

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 Pattern-based obfuscation: exchange of one instruction by a set of equivalent instructions.

 Abusing inline functions.

 Anti-VM techniques: prevents the malware sample to run inside a VM.

 Dead (garbage) code: this technique is implemented by inserting codes whose results will be overwritten in next lines of code or, worse, they won't be used anymore.

HTTP://WWW.BLACKSTORMSECURITY.COM

43

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Code duplication: different paths coming into the same destination (used by virtualization obfuscators).
 Control indirection 1: call instruction  stack pointer update  return skipping some junk code after the call instruction (RET x).
 Control indirection 2: malware trigger an exception  registered exception is called  new branch of instructions.
 Anti-debugging: used as irritating techniques to slow the process analysis.

44

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 ANTI-REVERSING
 Opaque predicate: Although apparently there is an evaluation (conditional jump: jz/jnz), the result is always evaluated to true (or false), which means an unconditional jump. Thus, there is a dead branch.
 Polymorphism: it is produced by self-modification code (like shellcodes) and by encrypting resources (similar most malware samples).

 Before proceding with MIASM, we need to create a binary containing our code, so we need an assembler and Keystone is great.

ALEXANDRE BORGES ­ MALWARE AND SECURITY RESEARCHER

 Keystone Engine acts an assembler and:

 Supports x86, Mips, Arm and many other architectures.  It is implemented in C/C++ and has bindings to Python, Ruby,
Powershell and C# (among other languages).

 Installing Keystone:

 root@kali:~/Desktop# wget https://github.com/keystoneengine/keystone/archive/0.9.1.tar.gz

Open the binary file generated through Keystone. The Container provides the byte source to the disasm engine.
Instantiates the assemble engine using the x86 32-bits architecture. Initialize and run the Symbolic Execution Engine, setting all registers to an initial value.
Print the final value of EAX.

 I've skipped a very long output, which shows all instruction being execute. We are interested in the final value of EAX. 
 If you want, view the graph:  apt-get install graphviz  apt-get install xdot  xdot out.dot

 Closing thoughts and Acknowledgments...
 Honestly, I didn't even scratch the surface of this topic....
 There're tons of obfuscation techniques and de-obfuscation/reversing techniques to explain... it would take one or two entire weeks...and probaly you wouldn't to know about it... 
 I'd like to thank SANS for the event and, in special, my friend Stephen Sims for the invite. 
 And, of course, I'd like to thank you (the audience) for attending my talk.
