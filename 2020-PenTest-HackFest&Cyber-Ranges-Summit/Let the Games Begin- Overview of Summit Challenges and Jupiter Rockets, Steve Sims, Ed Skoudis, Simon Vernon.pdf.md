The Idea....
· Due to extraordinary world circumstances, let's expand the SANS Pen Test HackFest Summit into a free event
· ....And add a Cyber Range and CTF track as part of the summit
· ....And offer some world-class range experiences to attendees
· ....And hold a Global Cyber Range Competition
- With a qualifier round - And finals at the event - And an awards ceremony!
