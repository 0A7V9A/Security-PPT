Quick poll: What is the most common and expensive attack vector?
· "Malicious attacks were the most common and most expensive root cause of breaches"
· "Substantially longer to identify and contain a breach in the case of a malicious attack: a combined 314 days"
· "breaches caused by a malicious attack were 27 percent more costly than breaches caused by human error ($4.45 million vs. $3.5 million)"
· "Breaches from human error and system glitches were still the root cause for nearly half (49 percent) of the data breaches studied"
· "System glitches and human error breaches are still costly, with an average loss of $3.24 million and $3.5 million respectively"

What is identity and access management (IAM)?
· Identity and access management (IAM) in enterprise IT is about defining and managing the roles and access privileges of individual network users and the circumstances in which users are granted (or denied) those privileges. Those users might be customers (customer identity management) or employees (employee identity management. The core objective of IAM systems is one digital identity per individual. Once that digital identity has been established, it must be maintained, modified and monitored throughout each user's "access lifecycle."
· Identity management (IdM), also known as identity and access management (IAM or IdAM), is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources. IdM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas of IT security and data management. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate, and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access.[1] Identity and access management solutions have become more prevalent and critical in recent years as regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex.[2]

Nope, IAM is very dynamic in nature

Quick Poll ­ what is the average cost per record lost in the U.S. · According to the Ponemon Institute report · So, let's calculate the worst-case scenario:

300,000 identities * $150 = $45,000,000 · Ouch!

So where is my identity? - a practical example ­ Zoom ­ Zoom ­ Zoom Reconnaissance and Discovery Activities / Potential Attack Vectors

· Directories / LDAP · Application / Databases · Data integration with 3rd party
applications - API's, flat files · Federated / Social
Authentication · IAM Provisioning · Client Software / Agents · Logs!! GET/POST data!! · Our Challenge:
· How do balance the user experience while securing their identity?

Zoom?

Facebook?

IAM? Google?

IAM Governance · Organizational Maturity Model

Identity Intelligence

· High demand for People, Process, and Technical resources

Entitlements Management

· Tends to be complex and challenging for many organizations, so what do we do?

Role Management

User Account Provisioning
IAM Governance

Access Request and Approval
Access Certification
Data Governance

Policy Governance

Given the hybrid nature of where identities are stored...
· Let's fix the problem - sledge hammer approach? · Purchase utilities for prevention, detection,
remediation, etc. to protect IAM? · Multi-Factor Authentication · The promise of Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) · API Management ­ including security policy, OAUTH
technologies, auditing and logging of traffic · Governing IAM is difficult, so how can we further
simplify?

Questions for Reflection & Guidance for Organizational Maturity
· Know thyself - are we leveraging the full potential of our IAM system? · Does our strategic plan involve an on-premise only, completely cloud-based, or hybrid
environment? · If cloud-based environments are utilized, should we deploy CASB? · Is our IAM solution meeting the needs for the dynamic information technology
requirements with the technology transformations? · Do our identity and access management processes fully secure 3rd party identities access
to our environment? Are we auditing/monitoring the 3rd party access? · Do we know all the privileged identities within our environment? · What process do we have in place to detect, prevent, or remove unused or orphaned
accounts? · How do we leverage multi-factor to ensure the person's identity? · Does our identity solution provide identity analytics showing how users access what
they have been granted? · Is our identity deployment providing the business value and outcomes we expect?
