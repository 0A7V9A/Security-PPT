Work With Operations
· Cyber contingency analysis (continuous analysis and preparing the system for
the next event)
· Cyber failure planning (modeling and testing cyber system response to network
and asset outages)
· Cyber conservative operations (Intentionally eliminating planned and unplanned
changes, as well as stopping any potentially impactful processes)
· Cyber load shed (Eliminating all unnecessary network segments, communications,
and cyber assets that are not operationally necessary)
· Cyber RCA (Root Cause Analysis forensics to determine how an impactful event
occurred and ensure it is contained)
· Cyber blackstart (cyber asset base configurations and bare metal build capability to
restore the cyber system to a critical service state)
· Cyber mutual aid (ability to utilize ISACs, peer utilities, law enforcement and
intelligence agencies, as well as contractors and vendors to respond to large scale events)
