Threat Modeling is Already a Thing
Lots of different things, actually.
· Threat-centric · System-centric · Asset-centric

For our purposes, we want to steer away from surveys and complicated documentation

The Case for Organizational Threat Modeling
· Stakeholders tend not to care about the cool rules you're writing
· Transparent, measurable, business-aligned · Can flow down to other models · Helps identify risky (or at-risk) processes
Challenge: you won't know everything

This can be another rabbit hole.
Best to stay high level and refine over time.

2. Identifying Infrastructure
· Web browser (untrusted) · API call (semi-trusted) · Administrative access (trusted) · Trust but verify

<Record Scratch> What About Threat Intelligence?
Intelligence should inform your threat model and serve as nexus for analyst focus/input

4. Measure and Iterate!

In Conclusion
· Ad hoc content development doesn't resonate with business owners
· Threat model should be an overlay for your use case framework(s)
· Show progress over time ­ sprints, goals, metrics

This is a good way to get out of the SOC and talk to system owners!
