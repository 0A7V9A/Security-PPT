Prosecutors are directed to consider whether or not a substantial federal interest would be served by prosecution of a CFAA case in which admissible
evidence is expected to be sufficient to sustain a conviction.

So What?

·Charging decisions for CFAA violations are guided by DOJ prosecution policy.
·In comparison to other federal crimes, CFAA offenses are not charged frequently -- and prosecuting someone engaged computer security research is extraordinarily rare.

·Sentences for CFAA offenses routinely have been below the minimum sentence recommended by the Guidelines.

So What?

Does this mean concerns about chilling security research should
be disregarded?
No.

· Computer security research is important ... we get it, really.
· DOJ is not at war with researchers. · We are open to--and have proposed--
amendments to the CFAA to avoid criminalizing trivial conduct. · Taking some common sense precautions will go a long way to avoiding hassles with law enforcement.
