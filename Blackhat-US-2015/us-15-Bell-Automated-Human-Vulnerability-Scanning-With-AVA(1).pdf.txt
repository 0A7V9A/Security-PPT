we are comfortable when we talk about technical vulnerability

we do not empathise or sympathise with machines they are tangible, inanimate objects.

technology is only part of the security picture

technology

people

process

technical systems are:
reviewed
scanned
penetration tested

processes are audited

What about People?

human-centric security current solutions
hope and scary questions?

human vulnerability is natural

Humans are sufficiently predictable to make it suitably annoying when we fail to predict their behaviour.

border devices are not enough

Security Awareness Education really
sucks

Posters don't work Stop it already.

Compliance has us racing to the bottom

· Phishing  a3ack  simOuultastooru   rced phishing programmes

1. Target connectivity ignored 2. Teaching outside of the work environment 3. Lack of reinforcement to build habit and behaviours 4. Lack of measurement 5. Lack of context

PHASE 1
Know

We don't know what our organisations look like

Human security risk is magnified by connection

Active Directory Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email providers

People Identifiers
Groups Relationships
Data

friends contacts frequency aliases profiles

Last login Location Pw Expires? Time stamps Disabled? Sender Influence Receiver
Admin? User agent

PHASE 2
test

Threat injection and behaviour monitoring

Email Social Networks Removable Media Files and honeypots SMS
Attack vectors that mean something

panic

Email

Internal request External request
favour

Removing the boundaries between business and personal

Security fails when it is treated like a special event
Instant, scheduled and recurring

Give the option of succeeding and reinforce good behaviours

PHASE 3
analyse

Behaviour Vs. time

Measuring impact of training

And now for something a little bit different

Bridges, weak links and targeting

Pivoting and propagation

You know what would be fun?

Dear demo gods please be kind. Here is a kitten. I hope it appeases you. From Laura

Case studies

The process
·Candidate and volunteer requests submitted to social media and contacts ·Volunteers briefed ·Removed volunteers including children, students or health data ·Active directory users and groups collected from active directory server
and stored in json files ·Json files processed to remove personal information ·Ava know used to parse and identify patterns

challenges

privacy

balance between what you need to see and what you'd like to see
Passing the power to the people not the managers
Encouraging community and collaboration
Openness, honesty and plain english

Alias management

convincing accounts
Accounts need history
may be compromised at any time

Momentum

New shiny toys never have a long life span small actions on a regular basis

Scheduling and automation Gamification and incentives.

WHERE NEXT?

From research project to real life

Testing Continuous Integration Roadmap development Feature development

Security culture change as a service?
