IoT Threat ­ as Massive Botnet for DDOS

Mirai IoT botnet DDOSed Dyn DNS & nearly crippled internet access for most US users & major US websites used by rest of the world - e.g. Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, etc

Delivered shocking
1.2Tbps - big leap from biggest DDOS not on IoT botnet !

IoT Threats ­ Summary

Vulnerable Device Software
·Buffer overflows, lack of authentication
Privacy Threat
·Due to device location tracking or personal information collection
Eavesdropping
·Including network attacks such as man-in-the-middle and message replay

Firmware-Level Attack
·Replacement of firmware during commissioning or routine upgrade
Device Cloning or Substitution
·Cloned devices can be sold cheaply and include backdoors
Data Leakage
·Confidential data may be captured from devices or from the back-end

© Cyber Security Agency of Singapore

Denial of Service
·Devices can be DoSed due to limited resources ·Device botnets can launch distributed DoS attacks
Weak Credentials
·Poor password choices and lack of 2FA for user and admin interfaces of devices, gateways or back-ends
Malware
·Devices can be infected with software designed to perform unauthorized actions

Evaluation and Certification
Key Findings
· Commonality ­ No commonly agreed evaluation criteria · Certification regime ­ Demanding in time and resources/costs · Collaboration ­ Nascent and yet to be mutually recognised widely
Possible Approaches
· Harmonise & Adapt existing certification regime for IoT · Innovate a Lite-version evaluation scheme for IoT · Garner support towards mutual recognition

Evaluation and Certification
© Cyber Security Agency of Singapore

Responsible Industry
Key Findings
· Immature ecosystem ­ IoT industry still evolving & rapid innovation · Incentive ­ Little incentive to implement security vs time-to-market,
nor to provide continuing product life-cycle security maintenance · Inadequate pressure ­ on industry to foster responsible behaviour
Possible Approaches
· Responsible industry via demand-driven and/or liability-legislation · Product security assurance regime through evaluation scheme · Continuing life-cycle support to provide patches for vulnerabilities

Device Identities and Root of Trust
Key Findings
· Unique identity ­ Poor asset visibility nor traceable authentication · Untrusted security ­ Lack trust anchor & chain of trust for security · Ubiquitous usable ­ even for low-cost or resource-constrained IoT
Possible Approaches
· Targeted measures to address IoT's resource-constrained limitation · Trust Anchor & chain of trust specially to support IoT use-cases · PUF can help alleviate need for Key-mgt on massive numbers of IoT

IoT Security Landscape Study ­ Conclusion
§ IoT Security Landscape Study is a good starting point of identified challenges and possible approaches for action
§ Create an ecosystem that is secure, from design to disposal, a challenge that requires global approach
§ Foster strong international collaboration amongst countries at the government, industry and academia
("triple-helix") thru International IoT Security Roundtable,
&/or other international platforms like GFCE § Prioritise 3 focus areas to tackle for the initial phase :
· Evaluation and Certification · Responsible Industry · Device Identities and Root of Trust
