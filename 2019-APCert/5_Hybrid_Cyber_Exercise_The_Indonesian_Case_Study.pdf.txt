Description

Complexity

Paper-driven exercise with injects scripted by exercise planners and delivered via paper (cards/discussion). This type of exercise can be planned and executed quickly, depending on the number of organizations involved.
Paper injects with some live Scenarios facilitated by a RT for realism (probes, scans, e-mail spoofing, etc.)

This type of exercise can be planned and executed quickly, depending on the number of organizations involved.
This type of exercise requires more planning and longer execution times.

Exercise plan incorporates real scenarios and injects into the exercise. Paper injects only used to stimulate if necessary

This type of exercise requires detailed coordination and planning.

Timing

Resources

Planning: 1­2 months
Execution: 1­ 3 days

Limited resources needed, depending on number of organizations.

Matches
Organizations new to exercises and to assessing organizational IA objectives.
Organizations that need to validate processes/ train personnel inbetween other exercises.

Planning: 3­6 months
Execution: 3­ 5 days Planning: 6­12 months
Build up: 2­3 months
Execution: 7­ 14 days

Requires more people and time, real targets for scenarios, deconfliction contacts.
Large number of Organizational participants, IT resources, travel budget for meetings, deconfliction contacts

Organizations familiar with interorganization exercises and a strong knowledge of their own objectives.
Organizations familiar with exercises, RTs, and their own organizational objectives.

WHY RUN HYBRID CYBER EXERCISE ?

Hybrid

Paper injects with some live Scenarios facilitated by a RT for realism (probes, scans, e-mail spoofing, etc.)

This type of exercise requires more planning and longer execution times.

Planning: 3­6 months
Execution: 3­ 5 days

Requires more people and time, real targets for scenarios, deconfliction contacts.

Organizations familiar with interorganization exercises and a strong knowledge of their own objectives.

¡ When it comes to what learning methods work best, everyone might be different, but hands-on exercise approach is favored by most Indonesian.
¡ People who practice what they're learning in a hands-on environment can often retain much more information when compared with only discussing the problem such as in Table Top Exercise.
¡ Enable the testing of procedures and ensure preparedness of staff to follow them.
¡ Laying out real reactions and behavior to exercise scenarios.

CII CYBER EXERCISE :
A HYBRID CYBER EXERCISE CASE IN INDONESIA

Malicious email (phising) detected.

Arrange precaution activities and
Executive Report

Preliminary investigation on the
phising incident.

Eradication process.

Further investigation by identifying
suspicious processes.

Malicious code behavior analysis and
investigation.

Security Alert is sent to all employees.

Further investigation on the impacted computer host.

Exercise scenario :
§ 8 injects related to malicious code (APT) handling.
Approaches :
§ Injection (cases of cyber incidents) and each questions are given in the Participants Handout document.
§ The activity consisted of several stages (cases). Participants may proceed to the next stage if they were able to correctly answer each question in the given case.
§ Participants can discuss only in his team. Exercise Assistants can provide technical assistance to Participants if needed.
§ After the activity ends, a discussion, evaluation and conclusion of the activity's results are carried out.
Assumption :
§ Participants are assumed to be Incident Response Teams / IRTs responsible for responding/handling incidents at each of your company's institutions.

THE PROCESSES

Identifying

Planning

Conducting

Evaluating

¡ Identifying :
¡ Have a clear objectives for the exercise and what measures to test on the exercise.
¡ Choose a high level scenario, a realistic scenario is critical to the success of the exercise.
¡ Choose the type of exercise, fit the need you have identified and the measures that should be tested.
¡ Identify key participants, involve their input into creating a realistic scenario and to ensure their enthusiastic participation.
¡ Setting size and scope of the exercise.
¡ Key point to consider : Identify the measures to be tested, which includes the processes and the people involved in those processes.

¡ Planning :
¡ Concept Development Meeting, discuss and get authorization on the activity, and determine the scenario being implemented.
¡ Initial Planning Meeting, discuss inputs for developing the scenario.
¡ Mid-Term Planning Meeting, discuss detailed scenario being implemented
¡ Final Planning Meeting, and finalize the scenario and final technical meeting.
¡ Key point to consider : Ensure that scenarios are realistic, and that they include the necessary injects that drive the scenario along.

Identifying

Planning

Conducting

Evaluating

¡ Conducting :
¡ Prepare the participants with some training material, so they have understanding of how they should act.
¡ The scenario needs to be managed and adapted in response to the actions of participants and pre-planned injects of new information.
¡ Provide a dashboard for controlling the scenario and receive updates on actions taken by participants.
¡ Key point to consider : Injects should simulate realworld communication about an incident.

¡ Evaluating :
¡ Evaluation ensures that lessons are learned, interdependencies identified, and that these are communicated effectively back to participants for them to take action.
¡ Key point to consider : Working closely with the stakeholders to reach consensus ensures the evaluation conclusions and recommendations will be accepted by stakeholders and gives greater chance the recommendations will be acted upon.

DEVELOPING THE SCENARIO :
SOME TIPS
¡ Aligning from a real attack to the exercise scenario and the measurements is tricky. However, it is crucial to make the scenario as realistic as possible.
¡ Have a good understanding of the participating organizations function, and how they will respond to incidents.
¡ Sometimes participants will act differently than expected, so you need to allow for multiple responses and actions of the participants.

DEVELOPING THE SCENARIO :
RED TEAM ACTIONS EXAMPLE FOR THE EXERCISE
Pre-Attack

ELABORATING THE SCENARIO :

1. Define Red Team (RT) actions.
2. Align each RT actions into exercise goals and measurements.
3. Elaborate/create detailed actions of RT.

4. Create timeline of RT actions.
5. Execute RT actions, based on the planned actions and timeline defined.
6. Record every RT actions for the exercise materials, i.e. evidence for incident response.

LESSONS LEARNED
¡ Identify the exercise measures to be tested first (the processes that need testing, the people involved in those processes, then build the exercise around these critical factors, i.e. defining exercise type, scenario, etc).
¡ The exercise participants should be involved in the planning phase, in order to ensure that the exercise addresses the issues that they consider most important, and that the scenario is as realistic as possible.
¡ Provide training or briefing for participants at the start of the exercise. The participants will need to understand the general conditions, the rules of the exercise, and the roles of the monitors.They may also require some training, if special tools will be used to simulate their duties.
¡ Consider how you will measure success of the exercise. For example, surveys of participants before and after the exercise to measure importance of certain issues, or a survey at the end to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercise.
