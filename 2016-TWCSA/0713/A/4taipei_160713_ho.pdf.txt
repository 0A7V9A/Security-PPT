Growth Factors - Policy
NISC "Information Security 2012"

 $4*35   

"for public private sector partnerships concerning targeted attacks and continuing with the sharing, analysis and examination of information, each entity is required to establish a system having CSIRT and other such functions, and ensure the staffing and enhancement of necessary personnel for emergency information security measures to cover the related agencies. It is also important to proceed with R&D and other activities and promote initiatives for effective measures to address targeted attacks."

Why?
 Just order from managements
· No motivation · They don't know what they should do
 Panacea
· No real operations

 Managements don't think about Security
· Already enough rules and firewalls and IDSs and so never happens security incident
· Don't care about the costs of security and CSIRT
