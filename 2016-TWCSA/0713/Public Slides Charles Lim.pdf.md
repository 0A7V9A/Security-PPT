What is Darknets?
Darknet ­ portion of routed, allocated IP space in which no active servers reside.
-- Team CYMRU

What is Darknets?

Livenet Live IP Address (used)

Darknet Unused IPs

Darknets and Honeypots
Goal · To understand cyber activities in our
institutions in Indonesia (Government, Education and Industry)
How · Honeypot servers put in the unused IP address
across the above organizations

Behind the scene
· Malware Analysis
­ Automatic Static Analysis (after unpacking) ­ Automatic Behavior Analysis (Cuckoo sandbox)
· Unpacking
­ Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) ­ Recover malware code from memory dump ­ Need improvement on unpacking multi layer
packed malware

Our Current Research
· Analyzing National DNS traffic
­ Malicious Domains identification ­ Botnet Identification ­ Insider Threats ­ Anomaly Traffic Identification in medium to
large ISP & Root DNS
· IDS with GPU

Our Future Research
· Capturing browser-based malware
· IDS with GPU
­ More optimized parallel algorithms
· Live DNS Traffic Analysis
· Android Malware Analysis

Conclusion
· Learning takes time: 1 year to learn honeypots, 1 year to get the first honeypot running
· Our honeypots installed in academic institution, ISP, local province government
­ Challenge: installing more honeypots in these institution
· Honeypots provides opportunity for lecturer and students to perform research together
