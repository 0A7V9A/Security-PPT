Ransomware today
· Multiple cryptovariants exist today, riding off the success of CryptoLocker · Use of different attack vectors, such as malicious macros and exploit kits · More sophisticated tactics, such as using anonymous networks like TOR or I2P for command and
control, CAPTCHAs for limited access to payment systems, and language localization efforts · Attacks are largely victim agnostic · Multiple platforms targeted, including Android and OS X · Ransomware as a Service now exists

How does ransomware get in?

EXPLOIT KITS

MALICIOUS EMAIL ATTACHMENTS

MALICIOUS LINKS IN EMAILS or YOUR Social
Networking!

Infected website or malicious ad via exploit kit

STEP 1 User visits compromised website, which is often a trusted location.

STEP 4 Exploit kit takes advantage of vulnerable software.

STEP 2 Malicious code redirects to exploit kit landing page. OR Malicious advertisement silently redirects to malicious web page.
STEP 3 Exploit kit web page loads and determines best route to infect user.

STEP 5 Exploit kit delivers ransomware payload.
STEP 6 Victim's sensitive files are encrypted and held for ransom.

Compromised Microsoft Word document

STEP 1 Targeted email with infected Microsoft® Office Word document delivered to user.

STEP 3 Office macros run, downloading ransomware from URLs within the document.

STEP 2 User opens Word document, thinking it is a legitimate file.

STEP 4 Victim's sensitive files are encrypted and held for ransom.

Seek first to gain visibility and reduce the attack surface
1 Gain full visibility and block unknown traffic

2 Enforce application and user-based controls
3 Stop dangerous file-types 4 Implement endpoint policy
aligned to your risk

REDUCE THE ATTACK
SURFACE

Prevent known threats
1 Stop known exploits, malware & command-and-control traffic
2 Block access to malicious and phishing URLs
3 Scan for known malware on SaaS-based applications
4 Block known malware & exploits on the endpoint

PREVENT KNOWN THREATS

Prevent unknown threats: Understand the power of context
1 Detect and analyze unknown threats in files and URL

2 Update the protections across the organization and prevent previously unknown threats
3 Add context to threats and create proactive protections and mitigation
4 Block unknown malware & exploits on the endpoint

IDENTIFY & BLOCK UNKNOWN THREATS
