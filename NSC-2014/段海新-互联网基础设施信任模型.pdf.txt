WORKING GROUP 4 Network Security Best Practices

:;8;= 5 (' !&$#(
In February 2012, a new, quite effective technique for maintaining a suspended domain that has been removed from its TLD zone was discovered. Such an attack has been given the moniker of a "ghost domain".40 An attacker can easily set up a legitimate domain (e.g. hacker.com) and control the domain's authoritative name server. The attacker will then submit DNS queries for www.hacker.com through several recursive name servers (which their botnets can query successfully from any ISP or network they reside), forcing the DNS servers to resolve www.hacker.com and cache the results, including nameserver information for that domain, and the IP address (controlled by the attacker) for the nameservers. Once hacker.com is identified as a malicious domain, remediation action will occur that will lead to the top-level domain registry (for .com in this example) removing hacker.com from their zone file. However, the recursive name servers will not query the top-level domain authoritative server (and subsequently remove hacker.com from their own records) until their cached TTLs for hacker.com and its authoritative nameservers expire. Consequently, by querying each targeted recursive name server regularly for new hostnames under hacker.com, those recursive nameservers will query the cached authority nameservers for the domain, which remains cached. The attacker will refresh the
