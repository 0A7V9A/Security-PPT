National Security Perspective
· All conflicts now have cyber dimension
­ Espionage, propaganda, DoS, infrastructure ­ Cyber terror / cyber war ?
· Strategic problems req strategic solutions
­ Nation-state, international ­ Beyond tactical, temporary fixes ­ Many unanswered questions!

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)
· Reduces anonymity
­ China: "Everyone" US: "Everything" ­ Limitless IPs, NAT not required
· Security game-changer
­ Native IPSec: authentication, encryption
· No silver bullet
­ SW/users still vulnerable
­ Privacy, politics, learning curve

Sun Tzu's Art of War
· Good ... not perfect guide to cyber conflict · Art of Cyber War
1. Artificial environment 2. Geography changes without warning 3. Physical proximity loses relevance 4. Blinding development of technology 5. Anonymity 6. Few moral inhibitions
11

Cyber Attack Deterrence
· Deterrence options
1. Denial 2. Punishment
· Deterrence requirements
1. Capability 2. Communication 3. Credibility
· Mutually Assured Disruption?
13

Cyber Arms Control
· Model: Chemical Weapons Convention
­ Cyber Weapons Convention?
· Easy to apply
1. Political will 2. Universality 3. Assistance
· Hard to apply
4. Prohibition 5. Inspection

IPv6 Art of War Deterrence Arms Control

Strategy Review
Evaluation
Increases attribution by lowering anonymity IPsec authenticates, encrypts; not mandatory Long, dangerous transition phase
Sun Tzu good but not perfect Concepts, law behind tech curve Cyber warfare has distinctive characteristics
Denial difficult, hacker skills easy to acquire Punishment lacks credibility Low attribution, high asymmetry, no one dies
How to prohibit what is hard to define? How to inspect cyberspace? Political will could change dynamics

All could help ... But each is only a partial solution

Future Work
1. Survey of cyber defense experts
· Deepen understanding of concepts
2. DEMATEL: individual factors
· Disaggregate Matrix X
3. DEMATEL: other cyber security challenges
· Can a cyber attack be an act of war? · Can we solve the attribution problem? · Can we shift the advantage to cyber defense?
