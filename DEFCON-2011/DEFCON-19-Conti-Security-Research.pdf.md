What is Research?
The search for knowledge, with an open mind, to establish novel facts, solve new or existing problems, prove new ideas, or develop new theories, usually using a scientific method.

Why Research?
· Advance human knowledge · Give back, so others can take
your work to the next level · Make yourself an expert · Valuable skill set · Fun and rewarding · Get credit, notoriety, profit · Build you resume · You are already doing the work
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beakers.jpg

What hackers bring to the table...
· Native curiosity · Cleverness · Color outside the lines · Hackers do great work · Less constraints, Less fear · Freedom to choose problems
that industry or academia can't/won't touch · Hackers can build things · Inspiration and obsession · Devious minds · Interesting ideas · Access to interesting data · Interesting acquaintances

Seek to be the World Expert

"In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours."
- Malcolm Gladwell Outliers

· Or at least an expert
· N world experts in the room
· Momentum
· Once at edge you will see problems (and solutions) that others don't know exist

Neal Stephenson "Why I am a Bad Correspondent"

"Writing novels is hard, and requires vast, unbroken slabs of time. Four quiet hours is a resource that I can put to good use."
"Two slabs of time, each two hours long, might add up to the same four hours, but are not nearly as productive as an unbroken four."
"If I know that I am going to be interrupted, I can't concentrate, and if I suspect that I might be interrupted, I can't do anything at all."

TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS STUDY (1932-1972)
· US Public Health Service research
· 600 low-income African-American males from rural Alabama with a high incidence of syphilis infection, were monitored for 40 years.
· Subjects were given free medical examinations, but they were not told about their disease.
· Even though a proven cure (penicillin) became available in the 1950s, the study continued until 1972 with participants and their families being denied treatment.
· In some cases, when subjects were diagnosed as having syphilis by other physicians, researchers intervened to prevent treatment.
· The study was stopped in 1973 by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare only after its existence was exposed in a newspaper story, and it became a political embarrassment.
· In 1997, President Clinton apologized to the study subjects and their families.

· Approves, monitors and reviews research involving human subjects.
· Response to research abuses in the 20th century, including Nazi experimentation and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.
· If you are dealing with human subjects, you may need IRB approval.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Siege_of_Ascalon_%281153%29.jpg

Keep your Personal Research Distinct from Work
· Use your own time, hardware, software
· Read your employment contract carefully and any NDAs carefully
· Don't let your personal work touch your employers resources.
· Smart employers/schools will respect your personal IP
http://source.nycsca.org/pdf/it/ITF-1a.pdf

Misc
· No dual submissions · Academic conferences probably don't pay travel or an honorarium
for speakers/panelists · Avoid asking people out of the blue to read your paper/article, a
thoughtful question or two is much better · Authors are typically sequenced from first author (biggest
contribution) to Nth author (least contribution) · "Authors" don't need to write a word · Sole author · When in doubt, acknowledge or cite · People get weird when you write up their "ideas" or work · With some research, discretion is advised
­ Even when drunk ­ Especially when the research is someone else's

A bit about Academia...

Academia is a Lot Like RE/MAX

Academia and Industry
· Follow the money
­ Research grants ­ Fads ­ Customers with money
· Industry
­ Must make case for bottom line
· Your advantages
­ Passion

Academia
· Academic Rank
­ Instructor ­ Assistant Professor ­ Associate Professor
· Tenure usually starts here
­ Professor
· Ranking of school != ranking of a given program
· Time
­ BS, 4 years ­ MS, 1-2 years
· Usually requires BS, but I've seen exceptions
­ PhD, 4-7 years
· Can pick up MS along the way
· Finish your degree, then cure cancer (Clark Ray)

Rooter: A Methodology for the Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy
Jeremy Stribling, Daniel Aguayo and Maxwell Krohn Accepted at WMSCI 2005
Many physicists would agree that, had it not been for congestion control, the evaluation of web browsers might never have occurred. In fact, few hackers worldwide would disagree with the essential unification of voice-over-IP and public-private key pair. In order to solve this riddle, we confirm that SMPs can be made stochastic, cacheable, and interposable.

Dear XXX,
I am writing on behalf of the German publishing house, VDM Verlag Dr. Müller AG & Co. KG. In the course of a research on the Internet, I came across
a reference to your thesis on "YYY".
We are a German-based publisher whose aim is to make academic research available to a wider audience.
VDM Verlag would be especially interested in publishing your dissertation in the form of a printed book.
Your reply including an e-mail address to which I can send an e-mail with further information in an attachment will be greatly appreciated.
I am looking forward to hearing from you. --
