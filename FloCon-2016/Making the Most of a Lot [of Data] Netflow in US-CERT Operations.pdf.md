A *Lot* of Data: The Quantifiable
· Scale:
· ~17B flows/day · decent chunk of storage
· Diversity:
· 300+ sensors · 100+ organizations · ~39M IP addresses monitored
· ~9M observed/day · ~45M IP addresses observed/day · ~3B IP addresses observed all-time

A Lot of *Different* Data: The Unquantifiable

Wide Range of Missions
Citizen Services, to Tourism, to Science and so much more.

Geographic Dispersion
National & International...
every time zone.

Both a Large Producer &
Large Consumer

Varied Usage & Security Filtering Policies

The Ever-evolving Network Landscape
· Thorns in the netflow analyst's side, some old, some more recent:
o NATs/proxies o Cloud services / shared hosting o Protocol convergence ­ Everything is HTTP(S) o IPv6 ­ a briefer's nightmare
· Encryption? No content, no problem - right?
o Depends on implementation and sensor placement o The NAT/proxy problem all over again

Yet Against All the Odds....
· Netflow remains an integral tool
Common US-CERT Use Cases
Augments signature-based alert data (detailed timestamps, pattern of activity vs. one-off, indicators of attack success)
Retrospective analysis ­ particularly in support of deployed incident response teams
Statistical/behavioral analysis still quite valid for certain types of threats (i.e. volume-based)
Assess viability of new threat indicators

Assess exposure / attack surface for new vulnerabilities
