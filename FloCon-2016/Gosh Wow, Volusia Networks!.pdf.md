Gosh Wow, Volusia Networks!
or An example of practical network management in a complex environment.

Overall Network Architecture
· Connect to 80+ remote sites using:
­ Dark fiber between data centers ­ Private SONET ring to major campuses ­ Metro E to minor campus locations ­ Broadband VPN connections to smaller sites (fire
stations, parks, treatment plants, etc) ­ Direct connect, MFN Metro E, T-1 to
municipalities ­ Microwave T-1s to 800 Mhz Public Safety Radio
Network sites

From an IT Director's Perspective:
· Are our customers needs being met?
­ Is the network robust? ­ Is the network reliable? ­ Is the network secure?
· Are we spending money wisely?

From a Network Manager's
Perspective:
· Configurations
­ Do we have an easy to access configuration archive for: · Planned replacements? · Unplanned (emergency) replacements?
­ Do our deployments have errors? (duplex, addressing, etc)
· Performance
­ Are we running out of steam? ­ Are we refining/optimizing our architecture?
· Traffic taking a smaller redundant path? · High bandwidth circuit bottlenecked by equipment? · Big circuit with a tiny usage?

How do we manage all that?
· Is anything broken?
­ Devices showing fault errors ­ Devices out of contact (device down or circuit outage)
· Can we do application analysis for:
­ Poor performance? ­ Application errors?
· Are we buying the right equipment?
­ CPU vs RAM mix for servers ­ Packet routing maximums (Mbps) for different routers ­ Buffer sizes and backplane capability for switches

Ciscoworks LAN Management Solution (LMS)
· Capture configuration changes automatically · Check for updated versions of network device
operating systems (IOS, IOSX, NX-OS) · Deployment scripts for OS updates and mass
configuration changes

Solarwinds Orion Network Performance Monitor (NPM)
· Circuit usage in Mbps (top 25 list and graphs)
­ Typical use patterns ­ Variation to baseline
· Circuit usage vs capacity (% usage) · Syslog error messages for immediate
problems (duplex mismatches, route flaps, etc) and timeline information
