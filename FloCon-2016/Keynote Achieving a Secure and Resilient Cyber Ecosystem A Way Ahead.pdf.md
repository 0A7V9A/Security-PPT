Our Responsibilities
At CS&C, we have two complementary and related missions:
In the telecommunications arena, we support interoperability and continuity of
communications needed in times of crisis.
In the cyber realm, we help the dot gov and dot com domains secure themselves, focusing on critical infrastructure.

The Cyber Ecosystem
· The cyber ecosystem is the foundation of our digital society. It consists of:
­ Government and private sector information infrastructure, including international
­ The interacting persons, processes, data, information and communications technologies
· It is expanding and under constant attacks
­ The Internet of Things will enhance digital society, but it also increases attack surface
­ The attackers are nimble and inventive and constantly evolving their attack methods

Secure Cyber Ecosystem

Our Ecosystem Gets Bigger and More Complex
· Endpoint Explosion = Attack Surface Explosion
· Predicted to grow to 50B devices by 2020 [1]
· Increased user dependency
· BYOD with little regulation
2015: Auto manufacturers rush to secure next generation vehicles Social media scams flourish on mobile Baby monitors and security cameras hacked

Attacks Are Continuously Expanding

November 2014: Sony hacked
December 17 2014: Sony pulls public release of `The Interview'

· Data breach attacks continue unabated
· Greater number of individuals and organizations impacted
· Business and policy decisions are affected
· Public trust is affected

January 2015: 80 Million affected by Anthem Data Breach

Our Opponents Improve Faster than We Do

The difference in rates produces a growing innovation gap between attackers and defenders' efficiency

· Volume, sophistication of attacks go up while cost and risk to attackers decreases
· Attackers are always on the offensive
· Attackers can efficiently compromise a system 90% of time
· Defenders detect attacks only 20% over same period of time

The Cybersecurity Challenge

· Security analysts have incomplete knowledge and situational awareness of their enterprise and overall ecosystem security health
· Adversaries improving faster than defenders

November 2014: Sony hacked. December 17, Sony pulls public release of The Interview

· Insufficient security analysts to meet future requirements
· Ability to detect and respond to intrusions too slow

January 2015: 80 Million affected by Anthem Data Breach

· Enormous growth of scope due to IoT

· Attackers rapidly innovating their attack methodologies
· Trust among organizations and with USG is not sufficient to automatically share and execute shared defensive courses of action

The difference in rates produces a growing innovation
gap between attackers and defenders' efficiency

· There is no resilient infrastructure that would support assured communications
