MCS Hardening - Challenges
 Proprietary and varying protocols & systems, which:  Do not include patch management, advanced authentications, etc.  Do not include built in security measures as part of their design  Lack documentation
 Challenging topology: Autonomous/field systems, Remote maintenance  Challenging hardening process:
 Extensive functionality and regression testing required  Real Time  Lack of domain knowledge to harden proprietary systems & protocols
 Proliferation of "how to" information on hacking MCS

Commercial Aviation at Risk
 GAO Findings: As the agency transitions to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faces cybersecurity challenges in at least three areas:
 Protecting air-traffic control (ATC) information systems,  Protecting aircraft avionics used to operate and guide aircraft (also
due to internet connection)  Clarifying cybersecurity roles and responsibilities among multiple FAA
offices

Cyber Multi-Hypothesis Analysis (MHA)
 Multi-Hypothesis Analysis (MHA)
 A method for handling complex & dynamic data  which is collected with various sources/sensors  which involves many entities,  whose information is partial and/or ambiguous as well as dynamically changing
 MHA can be applicable to Cyber Situation Awareness
 Integrating various security tools & techniques  Integrating different processing & analysis engines
 Multi-Hypothesis Analysis (MHA) is a powerful method to handle the uncertainty

#RSAC
Cyber Tracking
 Tracking is the process of associating events (data) including past events
 Generating a logical track of events enables  Verification of data consistency  Identifying the past origin of the track  Predicting the future evolution of the track

#RSAC
Multi Hypothesis Tracking (MHT)

Backward

t

 Confirm information consistency

 Investigate overlooked or dropped events

 Look for actor trend & behavior
