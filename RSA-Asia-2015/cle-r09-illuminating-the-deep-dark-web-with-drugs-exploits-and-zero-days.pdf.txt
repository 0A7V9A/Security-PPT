Deep Web Invisible web
Hidden web

#RSAC
· Dr. Jill Ellsworth used 1994 the term Invisible Web
· The first use of the specific term Deep
2001 Web occurred in Michael Bergman study

#RSAC Source: TOR Project

#RSAC
.Onion
· Works like a top-level domain · Tor Hidden Services · Can be hosted or Peer-to-Peer · Can be found by search engines only if they want to be · Must be on the TOR network or use a Web-to-TOR proxy to access · Looks like this: http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ - DuckDuckGo Search · Used for legitimate sites like Facebook and human right groups · Used for illegal services and forums for illegal activity · We are starting to see .onion sites with SSL ­ but that may actually reduce
anonymity

#RSAC
The Deep Web
· 1000X larger?
· 7Tb observed
· More than just WWW services
· Different levels of Deep Web

#RSAC
Why Search Engines Can't find them
 Private web  Unlinked content  Dynamic content  Limited-access content  Non-HTML content  Hidden source code

#RSAC
Playing the Levels

· Level 0: Common Web
· Level 1: Surface Web
· Reddit · Digg · Temp Email Services
· Level 2: Bergie Web
· Google locked results · Honeypots · 4Chan, Newsgroups, FTP, other services · Freehive, Bunny Tube, Streams

· Level 4: Charter Web
· Hacking Groups · Shelling Networking · AI Theorist · Banned media · Activist communications
· Level 5:
· Onion Sites · Illegal Material · Human Trafficking, Bounty Hunters, Rare
Animal Trade · Exploits, Black Markets, Drugs

#RSAC
Deep Web Level 8
· What happened to levels 6 ­ 7? · I have never seen it · Conspiracy theories? I have heard them
all
· Aliens, Illuminati, Controlling every computer in the world
· Specialized hardware coded devices to solve Quantum Computing Problems Needed???
· Made up, BS, Fake?

Tor Hidden Wiki ­ The First Place You will go to feel Dark
· Collection of hidden links and .onion sites · How hard is it to find?

#RSAC
Ghost Markets
· Black Markets on the Dark Web · They Change .onion addresses often · Sometimes invite only · Example: Silk Roads
· Nov. 6th 2013 Silk Roads shutdown · Nov. 13th 2013 Silk Road 2.0 · Nov 6th 2014 Silk Roads 2.0 shutdown · Nov 14th 2014 Pablo Escobar posted Silk Roads 3.0 is coming · Feb 4th 2015 Ross Ulbricht convicted on charges
· Buy malware, exploits, social engineering expertise · Social Security numbers, national identification cards · Scammers, con artists, organized crime, drugs, guns

Want to play a game?
 Use a different system to test. Don't use VMs. Use Live CDs or USBs
 Use a VPN on top of TOR (I like Private Internet Service ­ others? Tweet me @aamirlakhani)
 Don't connect back to your network  Spend time building a offline image.  Listen, surf, and don't participate  Almost all newbie's will get scammed, hacked, or in some sort
of illegal trouble (e.g .onion Twitter)

DarkNET can be a valuable tool for security professionals

#RSAC
How to Apply what I learned
 Darknet is a valuable tool for researchers to gauge the state of their cyber security program :
 Users need to be aware of the dark and dangerous groups of attackers.
 Reputation and Unified Threat Management Systems can help mitigate risks.
 Researchers need to understand traffic is not anonymous. Controlling entry and exit nodes may be able to reveal true identity of users. ISPs and law enforcement may monitor TOR and other protocols.
 Threat Intelligence can be gained by monitoring "chatter" on your employees and your organizations.

`Blastware' Beware

#RSAC

Recent destructive malware in the wild
 Disk Wipers  Overwrites hard-drive and MBR  Triggered by logic bomb/timer  South Korea, March 2013  3 banks, 2 media companies  50,000 systems
 Ransomware  Encrypts data  Leaves hard drive intact  Forensics unhampered

New 2014 FortiGuard Labs discovery: DorkBot
 Erases hard drive if analysis is detected
 New variations likely to destroy other targets
