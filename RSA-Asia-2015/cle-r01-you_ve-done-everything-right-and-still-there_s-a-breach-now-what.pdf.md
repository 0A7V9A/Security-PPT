Why Are Intrusions Successful?

#RSAC

Threats are targeted. macro-distribution supplanted by micro distribution (e.g., via packing, polymorphism)

Powerful attack toolkits available w/ tiered pricing, 24x7 customer support

#RSAC
Security Maturity Survey Results
Surveyed 400+ Security professionals across 60+ countries. 75% of respondents have significant cybersecurity risk exposure
Only a quarter of respondents surveyed indicated that they have mature security strategies and just 5% have Advantaged capabilities.

#RSAC
Capabilities Compared
Almost two thirds of respondents rated themselves as inadequate in every category

Threat Intelligence:

#RSAC

collecting and synthesizing internal and external threat data to implement effective detection, investigation, and response to security events

Security operations must maintain a certain level of flexibility. With zero-day events and other types of attacks that are less understood, security operations teams must be nimble and adaptive. Subscription-based services are good for additional help if your team is resource constrained.
-Jerry Geisler, Sr. Director, Information Systems Security Ops, Office of the CISO, Walmart.

Is threat intelligence about looking backwards...
... when we should be looking forward?

#RSAC
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. --Sun Tzu

Peel Back the Layers

Starting with a single artifact or threat indicator, you can find broader attacks.
21

#RSAC
Example Steps
1 Start with network address obtained from threat intel 2 See which hosts have connected to that address... 3 Identify the processes associated with that communication 4 Learn provenance of those processes (context) 5 Derive new indicators from the process chain 6 See what other systems have those indicators
22

#RSAC
Don't just have a plan... Review your plan and make sure it works
5

#RSAC
Incident Response planning has to be dynamic.
Organizations that fail to evaluate Incident Response plans against new threats expose their systems, data and infrastructure to attack.
24

#RSAC
prioritize And use business context 6

#RSAC
Balance between people, process, and technology

In Field Example

#RSAC

1 Identify initial malware (e.g., via traditional means or threat intel)

2 Has the malware been executed? How critical is the system?

Collect artifacts associated with that malware (e.g., parent 3 files, domains collected, etc).

4 Find other endpoints/processes associated with those artifacts...

27

Seven Key Steps: Summary
1 Eliminate Perimeter / Prevention Mindset
2 Strive for pervasive visibility
3 Leverage and operationalize threat intelligence
4 Don't sit back, be proactive

28

#RSAC
Applying What You Have Learned...
Immediate:  Review budget to see if it's too prevention/perimeter focused  Set-up regular review cadence for incident response plans
Intermediate term:  Inventory your assets to identify what's critical  Identify your blind spots
