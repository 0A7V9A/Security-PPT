Growing Security Concerns

1. BYOD

2. Device Loss / Theft

3. Unsecured Networks

1. Personal devices connecting to enterprise resources 2. Loss of enterprise data and productivity 3. Employees using open Wi-Fi networks for work

#RSAC
Running the Risk Report ­ High-level Findings
 Mobility security risks directly linked to user demographics, industry and geography.
(You must address all of these ­ not technology alone)

The behavior of #GenMobile is opening businesses to new risks

The Secure Mobility Risk Index tool ­
IT can benchmark relative to 11,500 users

Security must evolve to adaptive trust model ­
integration & context for policy enforcement

#RSAC
The Threat Landscape Is Evolving
More Sophisticated Attacks Well Resourced Groups Risks Likely Start Within
