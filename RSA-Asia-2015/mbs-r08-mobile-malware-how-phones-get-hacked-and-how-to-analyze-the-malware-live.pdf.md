iBanking
 Actively sold for over a year. During this time, price raised from $4,000 to $5,000
 Most notably used by Neverquest (aka Vawtrak) cyber gang
 Communicates over SMS and/or HTTP
 Commands supported: ­ Capture all in/out SMS & call-list ­ Send SMS / perform a call ­ Redirect incoming calls ­ Record ambient noise of the surroundings ­ Wipe all data from the device

#RSAC
The iBanking Leak
 In February, 2014 the iBanking source code was leaked on several underground forums  Following that, few modifications were observed:
 AES algorithm was added to encrypt all of the app's resources  Security fixes to the web-panel  Code obfuscation (Spaghetti code)  Anti-SDK mechanism

#RSAC
Wrap-up & Summary
 iBanking is one of many active mobile malware projects  They are maturing (using encryption, avoiding detection and
analysis etc)  Android and Jailbroken IOS platforms are susceptible  The consumer needs to be aware and vigilant  The reality of BYOD and MDM solutions

#RSAC
Apply ­ Short Term
 Always inspect the permissions apps request before installing
 Make sure the "Verify Apps" option is turned-on  Do not allow users to install from sources other than
the Google Play Store by disabling the "Unknown Sources" option in the Security Settings  Do not allow "USB Debugging" unless needed  Do not Root or Jailbreak your device  Make sure that no admin rights are given to applications you really trust them
17

#RSAC
Apply ­ Long Term
 If your organization is infected with any kind of malware, acquire the knowledge and tools needed and spend the time to analyze and investigate the malware.
 Block any IOC found in any incident.  Create a short seminar for employees in order to increase their
awareness to these attacks and how to avoid them.

Mobile Malware Analysis Basics
 Dynamic Analysis
 Running the Malware in a confined environment, such as an emulator or a VM. In our case the most popular tool is the Android SDK.
 Static Analysis
 Reviewing the Malware's package, and more specifically the code and the malware's resources.

Dalvik ­ Android Java VM
 Dalvik is the virtual machine (VM) in Google's Android operating system.
 It is the software that runs the apps on Android devices.  Dalvik is thus an integral part of Android, which is typically used on
mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets.
26

#RSAC
Android Architecture

#RSAC
Dalvik ­ Android Java VM
 Programs are commonly written in Java and compiled to Bytecode.
 They are then converted from Java Virtual Machinecompatible .class files to Dalvik-compatible .dex (Dalvik Executable) files before installation on a device.
 The compact Dalvik Executable format is designed to be suitable for systems that are constrained in terms of memory and processor speed.

#RSAC
Bytecode?
 Bytecode, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter.
 The name bytecode stems from instruction sets which have onebyte opcodes followed by optional parameters.
· Opcode is the binary representation of a specific bytecode instruction.
29

#RSAC
ByteCode - JIT
 Some systems, called dynamic translators, or "just-in-time" (JIT) compilers, translate bytecode into machine language as necessary at runtime: this makes the virtual machine hardware-specific, but doesn't lose the portability of the bytecode itself.
30

#RSAC
Smali/Baksmali
 Smali/Baksmali is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik (Android's Java VM implementation).
 The syntax is loosely based on Jasmin's/dedexer's syntax.

#RSAC
Smali/Baksmali
 The names "smali" and "baksmali" are the Icelandic equivalents of "assembler" and "disassembler" respectively.
 Why Icelandic you ask? Because dalvik was named for an Icelandic fishing village.

APK
· Android application package file (APK) is the file format used to distribute and install application software and middleware onto Google's Android operating system.
· An APK file contains all of that program's code (such as .dex files), resources, assets, certificates, and manifest file.
· APK files are ZIP file formatted packages based on the JAR file format, with .apk file extensions.
