Introduction  Q: How do we achieve standardization, efficiencies and cost
savings in the third party risk assessment process?  A: By agreeing that third party risk management is not a
competitive issue.
Collective Intelligence + Industry Standard --------------------------------------------= Improved Risk Assessment Process

#RSAC
The Environment
 Dependence on outsourcing critical services increases inherent risk  Numerous and overlapping regulatory requirements and heightened
expectation on assurance, including increased transparency regarding cybersecurity practices  Boards and senior management involvement in the risk reporting process  Proprietary methods for information gathering and assessments are inefficient, costly and lack standardization  Risk areas continue to evolve and expand  Threats are becoming increasingly more sophisticated

The Need ­ Robust Vendor Management Programs
 Evaluate, track and measure third-party risk  Alignment of risk controls to corporate requirements to lessen
exposure to risk from third (and fourth) parties  Ensure compliance to regulations, standards and guidelines  Consistent, robust and repeatable process  Ongoing oversight program

The Problem
 Lack of standardized risk assessment processes by outsourcers  Varying interpretation of regulations and differing risk appetites  Service providers resources strained by outsourcers
 Need to respond to diverse client information requests  Time and resource intensive onsite visits

The Solution ­ The Collaborative Onsite Assessment
 Top-tier US-based financial institution risk managers working collaboratively to improve the third party risk environment
 Leverage the collective intelligence to improve current standards for IT, privacy and data security controls
 Shared Assessments Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP)  Service Organization Control (SOC) 2
 Utilize industry associations to foster collaboration and provide project management
 Shared Assessments Program  Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)

Project Goals - Creating Efficiencies
 Collaborate on Onsite Assessments of Key Third Parties
 To the extent that common services are offered to multiple organizations in the financial services industry, evaluate the associated risk in a consistent, uniform manner  Leverage the Shared Assessments Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP), standardized testing procedures for onsite assessments, as the common risk assessment methodology  Reduce the time and expense of conducting multiple onsite vendor assessments  Ensure a standardized, robust, consistent, and repeatable evaluation of a vendor's risk posture

Project Goals - Improve the Framework
 Top tier financial institutions worked collaboratively to develop:
 A "Superset" AUP framework for onsite assessments (Shared Assessments)
 Development of a SOC 2 Plus (SIFMA)
 Both projects hold the same common goals ­ the development of a more robust and scalable risk assessment process that injects speed, efficiency and cost savings into the third party risk assessment process

Project Pilot: Collaborative Onsite Assessments
 Participants "piloted" the process of working collaboratively to assess key third parties for whom they share common shared services:
 Pilot 1: Iron Mountain + 3 financial institutions  Pilot 2: Early Warning Services, LLC + 5 financial institutions  Pilot 3: Small Business Financial Exchange (SBFE)
 Superset AUP now meets all internal corporate requirements for many U.S. financial institutions, including key pilot participants:
 JPMorgan Chase; Citigroup; Capital One; US Bank; Morgan Stanley; Northern Trust

#RSAC
Collaborative Assessment Pilot Approach
 Step 1: Determine participants
 Select 3+ financial institutions to participate in a joint assessment  Select a vendor broadly used within the financial services industry
 Step 2: Scoping
 Scope and location of services outlined by the vendor  Financial Institution participants agree to the scope and location of services
 Step 3: Selection of auditor
 Participants agree to auditor to conduct the shared assessment
 CPA or Non-CPA independent assessment firm may be used
 Step 4: Superset modifications
 Leveraging the gap analysis developed in the mapping of requirements to AUP, auditor adds additional controls and testing procedures to create the Superset
 Participants review and approve for accuracy and completeness

#RSAC
Collaborative Assessment Pilot Approach
 Step 5: Assessment prep
 Auditor and Service Provider narrow the AUP to the specific services being assessed
 Step 6: Assessment performed
 Auditor schedules and conducts an onsite assessment using the narrowed Superset AUP
 Step 7: Post assessment
 Auditor presents the findings from the assessment to the service provider  Service provider presents comments and observations to auditor in response for
inclusion into the report  Auditor presents final report to all participants  Financial institutions meet separately with service provider to review and agree
upon remediation plan(s) for any issues or findings

Pilot Lessons Learned
 More robust framework developed with broader risk domain coverage than individual proprietary practices
 More robust controls testing process  Efficiency gained through one assessment by multiple banks  Enhanced communication and improved relationship between
financial institutions and third party service providers  Assessors are completely independent of participating banks  Each participant able to view report based on their unique risk
environments

Benefits Summary
 Increased rigor, consistency, efficiency and cost savings in the control assessment process for both the outsourcing organizations and the service provider
 Larger Tier 1 and 2 service providers would benefit most immediately from participating in collaborative assessments
 For mid and small size institutions who cannot necessarily dedicate a high level of resources to meet the changing regulatory and evolving risk environment, there exist tangible cost savings and personnel efficiencies benefits through use of a consistent, reliable tool
 More robust control sets developed through collective intelligence are expected to drive improvements in service provider programs

#RSAC
Continuous Efforts and Improvements
 Next Steps:
 Ongoing development and refinement of the Superset AUP to ensure additional robustness by expanding the collective intelligence to include additional financial institutions
 Develop and broaden the collaborative onsite assessment program including project management services
 Release the enhanced Superset AUP Program Tool mid 2015  Promote adoption of the Program's Superset AUP as a best practices
standard for each industry or sector as they are developed.

#RSAC

 Setting the standard in U.S. vendor risk assurance since 2005, now expanding internationally
 Created by leading financial institutions, the Big 4 accounting firms, and key service providers to:
 Standardize an objective framework for outsourcers to gather service provider information through a repeatable and consistent evaluation process
 Raise the bar on third party risk management by creating a comprehensive onsite security evaluation process, regardless of who performs the assessment (CPA, independent assessment firm, internal assessor)
 Ensure a means for keeping current with the latest regulations, standards and new risk control areas
 Create efficiencies and reduce costs for all stakeholders

 Methodologies for managing the vendor risk lifecycle
 Two complementary tools to document service provider management of information security controls
 Standardized Information Gathering (SIG) questionnaire
 Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP) ­ standardized testing procedures for onsite assessments
 "Trust, but verify" approach to conducting third party assessments
 Trust = SIG: Uses industry best practices to gather and assess information technology, operating and data security risks (and their corresponding controls) in an information technology environment
 Verify= AUP: Used by companies to evaluate the controls their service providers have in place for information data security, privacy and business continuity
