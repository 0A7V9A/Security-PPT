Defending Zero Day
 Lessons from the Ebola Outbreak
#RSAC

#RSAC
Ebola Virus ­ History
 First detection in 1976 in Congo, Central Africa
 Killed 288 people (88% fatality)  Disease was spread by close personal contact and by use of
contaminated needles and syringes in hospitals/clinics.  Ebola is a river in Congo near the village where the first infection was
found
 Second outbreak in 1995, again in Congo
 Killed 250 people (81% fatality)  traced to patient-zero who worked in the forest adjoining the city.
2

#RSAC
Ebola Virus ­ History
 Highly Contagious
 Transmission from animals to humans and human to human  Through broken skin or mucous membrane  Close contact with infected patients and their body fluids.  Exposure to dead-bodies of infected patients
3

#RSAC
Ebola Cure
 No known cure or vaccines
 In IT security parlance ­ a zero day exploit
 An equal opportunity killer
 Ebola affects every human being ­ healthy or sick  Luckily in IT Security ­ very few universal exploit
4

#RSAC
Ebola Outbreak ­ 2014
 4 Countries affected
 Three failed to contain, 1 succeeded
 Liberia, Guinea, Sierre Leone
 struggled to cope up  14000 people died
 Nigeria , did a great job in containment
 Only 8 people died
5

#RSAC
The Sad News first ...
6

#RSAC
Guinea, Sierre Leone, Liberia
 Dec 2013 - Patient-zero in Guinea  2 year old contacted the disease from Wild bats
 JAN-Feb 2014 - Spread out slowly  5 deaths in immediate family  8 deaths originating from a person who attended the funerals
 March 2014 - WHO declares outbreak  March 2014 ­ June 2015
 Spread to 2 neighbouring countries Liberia and Sierre Leone  Fatality rate ~ 50%
 30000 infections , 14000 deaths
7

#RSAC
Ebola Response
 Identify infected people
 Quarantine/Treat the infected
 Contact Tracing
 Who was in "contact" with the infected  Monitoring health status of these "contacts"
 Spread awareness
 About precaution, detection and response
8

#RSAC
Safe Burial
9

#RSAC
Challenges
 Shortage of trained medical personnel
 USA has 245 doctors/100000 people , Guinea has 10 doctors/100000 people
 Shortage of medical facilities
 Shortage of Gloves , protective equipment , mattress for hospital beds  Death of medical staff due to lack of equipment
 Shortage of infrastructure
 No technology or centralised facility for tracking status of "probable" cases
 Social Stigma for victims and care-givers
 Lesser reporting by victims , increasing risk of transmission  Lesser number of voluntary care-givers, increasing fatality

How Nigeria contained

#RSAC

Ebola

#RSAC
Ebola in Nigeria
 Nigeria  Most populous African country  Better medical facilities than first 3
 July 2014 : Patient-zero enters Nigeria (from Liberia)  Initially suspected as Malaria , Ebola was not detected until 3 days
 Infects hospital staff  Patient zero dies on July 25
 Other hospital staff died soon after
 Oct 2014 :WHO declared Nigeria Ebola Free  20 infections, 8 deaths, no new infections till date
12

#RSAC
What Nigeria did right ?
 Securing Patient Zero  Patient identified and kept in quarantine  Not allowed to come into "contact" with others
 Efficient Contact tracing  280 people identified as "contacts" of Patient zero. Total of 885 people tracked  Twice a day health check for these 885 people for 21 days
 18500 face-to-face visits by trained volunteers
 Better medical laboratories  For faster more accurate testing of samples
13

#RSAC
What Nigeria did right ?
 Learning for the past incidents
 In 2012 , Nigeria has a similar incident against Polio Virus  Central Incident Response was used to track every child is getting vaccinated  This Center was converted into Ebola Emergencey Response centre for Contact
tracing
 Good Governance
 Declared a medical emergency on day of first detection  Presidential decree giving powers to track mobile devices and use law enforcement
to track people at risk  Moving any corpse around the country required a letter , from the Ministry of Health,
to certify that the death was not related to Ebola  Emergency Ebola phone hotline.
14

#RSAC
What Nigeria did right ?
 Awareness Campaign  Community approach to messaging
 church leaders, military, doctors, government officials- all actively involved  Message of Hope
 Earlier you report, higher the chances of saving your life  Make "Heroes" of patients and contacts
 Save your Country by doing the right things of reporting  Android Mobile App for care givers
 Set of questions to identify if person is infected  Work on the messaging
 Keeping out Ebola, it is as easy as ABC ( Avoid Body Contact)
15

#RSAC
What Nigeria did right ?
 Good Luck
 Patient zero collapsed at airport and taken directly to hospital  If he was not quarantined at airport , he would have made untraceable "contacts"
 Patrick Sawyer, a VIP , Liberian Civil servant, was not ready to accept his condition  Dr. Adadevoh was adamant in keeping him at hospital
 Patient died on July 25  Dr. Adadevoh died of Ebola on Aug 21
 .....and some Bad Luck
 Patient zero was on Liberian Health Ministry "watch list"  His sister had died of Ebola on July 8
 Health Ministry did not update Immigration Ministry. So he could get out of country

#RSAC
What is Zero Day ?
 Zero Day
 refers to the number of days the community has to respond to a new threat or vulnerability
 Zero Day Vulnerability
 A vulnerability for which no security fix is available
 Zero Day Exploit

#RSAC
Preparation Stage
 Build the Team  Core CISO team , business support team , trainable volunteers
 Knowledge of own environment  Asset database , asset owners, asset security status
 Knowledge of your partners environment  SLA on incident response, security status
 Essential security tools  Tools for detection and response
 Effective governance structures  Faster decision making , enforcing decisions  No exceptions

Preparation Stage
 Testing facilities
 Solutions need to be tested accurately and quickly in local environment
 Incident Drills
 Ensure technologies , people and process readiness  Build relationships( outside CISO team ), increase awareness  Test decision-enforcement capabilities  Test information exchange capabilities
 Awareness Campaign channels
 Keep the channels active during good times
 Leverage Global & Local Security Intelligence Network
 Subscribing to Global Threat and Vulnerability advisory forums  Sharing your threat intelligence

#RSAC
From "Plan" to "Do"
 Identification
 How do I identify if I am being targeted  Signature based detection (exploit code, IDS/WAF signatures, TI feeds)  Non signature based detection - Network traffic patterns, End user behaviour patterns, End point behaviour
 How do I identify vulnerable hosts  Asset database  Latest Vulnerability scan status database  On demand ­ vulnerability specific ­ scan
24

#RSAC
From "Plan" to "Do"
 How do I identify compromised hosts  File system changes  Network traffic patterns  System behaviour  General service outage
 Global Status tracking
 Is the exploit evolving ?  Is the list of attackers available ?  Are there new ways to detect or prevent this
25

#RSAC
From "Plan" to "Do"
 Risk reduction  How can I reduce risk of infection
 Shut down vulnerable service
 Restrict access to vulnerable service
 "BLOCK" on Border devices for attackers or attack patterns
 Train security volunteers  Educate the team on identification , response measures
 Increase Awareness  With users, customers. Partners  IT & Network operations team
26

#RSAC
From "Plan" to "Do"
 Do the Drill
 For the specific exploit , do a table top walk through  Assign a Point of Contact
 Encourage Reporting
27

#RSAC
"We Got Hit" - Containment
 Quarantine infected systems
 Isolate victim systems as much as feasible or disconnect  Segregate network with "potential" victims
 Increase gateway defence
 Reduce chances of new infections & propagations
 Contact tracing
 Identify internal and external contacts  Track health status of "potential" contacts
29

#RSAC
"We Got Hit" - Eradication
 Heighten Alert Level  Increase awareness on infection
 Clean up  Analyse the infection for mutants  Repair system or reconstruct  For endpoint infections, take a blackout window if needed
 Monitor  Monitor "cleaned" systems for re-infections
 Share Threat intelligence
