Mining the global Internet for early warning
 DDoS Attacks and Traffic Visibility  Reversing Malware.  Reversing Botnets.  Reversing Campaigns.  Sinkholes and Malware infection.  Access the playbook - Tools, tactics and procedures.  I could have also covered IPv4/6 address space scanning,
Honeypots, Honeyclients.... alas.

Examples of early warning
 An IP address or website you manage is about to be hit by a DDoS attack, it will be POST based with some identifiable headers.
 The bank you work for is targeted by a specific banking trojan, here are the latest javascript and HTML web injects being used.
 Your credit card was just compromised at a store in Singapore.  DDoS attacks in your country and region are increasing, the largest
in terms of bandwidth was 334Gbps and 30Mpps in Q1 this year.  The Alina PoS Malware has started phoning home from your
network and it's sending magnetic stripe data from KIOSK1.

ATLAS Platform
 Where we source our data from - ATLAS.  300+ ISPs sharing real-time data.  142 Tbps peak visibility, ~30% of all Internet traffic.  Malware processing ~150,000 malware samples a day.  Botnet Reversing and Simulation (DDoS, APT, Bankers, PoS)  Web Injects, DDoS Targeting, Banker Targeting.  Infection monitoring through Sinkholes.  Push all this information into security feeds for Arbor products.

The promise of Threat Intelligence
 Threat information can travel faster then campaigns.  You can pass faster than you can run.
 Each campaign is different, each geography is different, we can learn and apply prior to targeting.
 There's benefit in sharing but mining production is expensive.  Sharing pathways will have to be built or incentives will ensure they
exist due to the value of data and the need for repatriation.  All current advanced threat emits information. We just need to tune
in.

Apply Slide
 Next week you should:  Think about campaigns that target you, identify the threat intelligence you could use to defend against them.
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:  Solve advanced threat ;)  Start evaluating different free, open source and commercial threat intelligence feeds.  Identify how you could you use threat intelligence information in your organisation.  If you're looking for data repatriation start the conversation with TI producers.
