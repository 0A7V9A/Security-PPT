A Dramatic Change in Severity levels
The unknown hackers who penetrated TV5Monde used the compromised social networking accounts to post slogans and images in favor of the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham. The TV5Monde network went dark for half a day while engineers
struggled to recover. The cause of the breach remains unknown.

Today's Threat Environment is different.. Only Advanced Analytics can detect these threats

Traditional threats conclusively recognized at runtime, prevented at the endpoint and perimeter.
However, many threats:
Require a broader view to recognize Will only emerge over time Get lost in the noise

Detecting a class of threats only a Big Data, Machine Analytics based approach can realize
Effectively prioritizing threats, separating the signal from the noise
Providing the intelligence required to deliver optimally orchestrated and enabled incident response

Prevention is Futile
"Advanced targeted attacks make prevention-centric strategies obsolete. Securing enterprises in 2020 will require a shift to information and people-centric security strategies, combined with pervasive internal monitoring and sharing of security intelligence."
"By 2020, 60% of enterprise information security budgets will be allocated for rapid detection and response approaches up from less than 10% in 2013."
- Neil MacDonald

A Security Intelligence Driven Approach is

Required

The cost of mitigating a threat, and risk to the business, rise exponentially across the lifecycle of a threat from inception to mission attainment.

Reconnaissance

Initial Compromise

Command & Control

Lateral Movement

Target Attainment

· Exfiltration · Corruption · Disruption

Organizations that desire to reduce their risk of experiencing a high impact cyber breach or incident must kill the threat early in its lifecycle, across the holistic attack surface.

Faster Detection & Response Reduces Risk

Business MTTD = 205 Days RISK & IMPACT OF BREACH

As organizations improve their ability to quickly detect and respond to threats, the risk of experiencing a high impact breach is greatly reduced.

Security Event Data
Captured Log & Machine Data
Generated Forensic Sensor
Data

User Analytics
Machine Analytics

Assess threat and determine if it may pose
risk and whether a full investigation
is required.

TIME TO RESPOND

INVESTIGATE

MITIGATE

Fully analyze the threat and associated risk, determine if an incident has or is occurring.

Implement countermeasures and controls that
mitigate risk presented by
the threat.

Why a Security Intelligence Maturity Model ?
 There is an increasing rate and growing sophistication of cyber threats, which is leading to an increased awareness of the severity of cyber threats
 A fundamental shift is taking place on how an Enterprise delivers Security Intelligence and Cyber Security protection to the organization
 Security Monitoring and Intelligence are still not well defined and need a framework to enable recognition, review and response
 A clear definition and maturity model provides organizations with a roadmap of how to orchestrate this shift to achieve organizational security goals - What is your Mean time to detect and respond..?
