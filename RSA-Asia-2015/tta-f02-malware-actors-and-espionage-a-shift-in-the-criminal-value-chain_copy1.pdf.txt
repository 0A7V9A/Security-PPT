The pre-history of financial malware - 2004

#RSAC

 Where it all started  Bankpatch  Haxdoor  A-311 Death  Limbo / Nethell  Lots of tweaking required

5

#RSAC
Cybercrime kits - 2006
 ZeuS appears in 2006  Aimed at finance  Man in the browser  Anyone can run an attack  Introducing Slavik  Very popular
6

#RSAC
The start of an ecosystem
7

#RSAC
The start of a battle - 2009

 Gunning for ZeuS market share
 First versions were terrible, but cheap

 Author is Gribodemon  Adopts ZeuS config style

8

Carberp - 2009

#RSAC

ZeuS and SpyEye were not the only game in town anymore
Attacks in Europe
Broke an important rule
Key members arrested in 2012

#RSAC
Intrigue in the underground - 2010

What seemed to happen

What really happened

 ZeuS is at version 2.0.8.9
 Suddenly Slavik announces he is quitting and
handing over support and development to Gribodemon, author of SpyEye!

 Slavik was part of a gang using ZeuS to go after high value accounts ­ JabberZeuS
 More profitable than selling ZeuS
 Wants to get rid of kit business
 Starts work on next versions which becomes P2PZeuS

10

#RSAC
The Big Leak - 2011
 Early 2011 ZeuS 2.0.8.9 leaks  Lots of new families appear  ICE-IX  Citadel  KINS  Cost of malware goes down
11

The end of SpyEye - 2012

#RSAC

 Gribodemon never releases a SpyZeuS
 Instead he too starts working on a managed version of SpyEye, SpyEye2
 But he is arrested in 2012 while on holiday in Costa Rica and extradited to the US

12

#RSAC
Slavik branches out
 P2P ZeuS investigation  500,000 private keys found  Cryptolocker  Ransomware

Others branch out
Selling bots to spies

#RSAC
Scaling through mobile

14

#RSAC
And find innovative ways...

Litecoin mining

POS malware

15

#RSAC
Today's POS malware ecosystem

A pivoting moment

#RSAC

 From 2011 ­ 2014, P2PZeuS very popular
 Commercial banking  Active worldwide  In 2014 FBI takes down botnet  Slavik's identity known

17

#RSAC
Slavik's last months: Jan-May 2014

#RSAC
A period of quiet: H2 2014

#RSAC
A new storm: H1 2015

#RSAC
A game of whack-a-mole?

Carberp Returned as Anunak

Gribodemon Was a scapegoat

Slavik Customers took over

21

#RSAC
A shift in the criminal value chain

Past: fully automated attacks

Present: semi automated

22

#RSAC
Today
 Other groups focus on retail ­ POS  Copycat ransomware  Dyre and Dridex  Anunak ­ retail and Russian banks
23

Dridex

#RSAC

Dyre

#RSAC
 New malware  Uses tokengrabber  Hybrid attack with webfake  Server Side Injects
25

Anunak / Carbanak

#RSAC
 Remnants of Carberp  Using custom malware  Targeting (Russian) banks  And Western retailers  ATM networks, channel attacks  Espionage  Gave many quite a scare...
26

Attack types are

#RSAC

converging

But not all of them...
27

#RSAC
 Criminals are more pragmatic than we can predict  They scale & branch out  To espionage, ransomware, litecoin mining, mobile & POS  Attack methods converge: espionage, financial & APT
28

#RSAC
 But: threats evolve, they don't appear out of nowhere  Global context & attribution helps you understand (is not
about malware anymore)  Build on your intelligence position in ways you can afford
