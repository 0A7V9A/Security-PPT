A Picture of the Region
 Within Asia 1.32 billion are online.  Home to least networked countries and some of the most
networked.  Varying approaches to cyberspace, eg. threat vs. opportunity.  Growing connectivity has exposed lack of domestic supporting
structures.  Geopolitical regional tensions reflected in cyberspace.

A Government Perspective

#RSAC

& Military Uses of Cyber

Government Organisation
What we've seen
 Flurry of new national cyber strategies.  Cyber security given ministerial
prominence.  Barriers to implementation still an issue.  Opportunity to share understandings.

Cybercrime
What we've seen
 Massive growth in new internet users, double edge sword.
 Lack of harmonized legal structures, served as a barrier.
 Large percentage software is pirated (84% in Indonesia 81% in Vietnam), increases botnet risk.

Applying Cyber Maturity
 How does the growth in the digital economy in the Asia-Pacific impact your potential growth as a company or government?
 What are the broader sets of risks involved for you?  Assess where your `sweet spot' is in the new emerging markets in the
region and build decisions you make from a solid research base.  When making policy decisions look beyond your usual horizons and try
and assess how they will be impacted upon by political trends, legislation, and societal considerations.
