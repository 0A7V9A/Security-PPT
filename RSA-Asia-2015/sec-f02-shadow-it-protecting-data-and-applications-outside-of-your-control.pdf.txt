Reducing Shadow IT

Adoption Drivers

Response / Action

 Faster to colaboration

 Provide supported alternative

 Ease of trying something new
 Leveraging other experiences
 Operational efficient, focus on the business

 Provide accessible environments ( IaaS, PaaS) IT needs to shift to provider role
 Select products that provide hybrid offerings

 Be an enabler

Cloud Security Strategy

#RSAC
What is the Cloud ?
 Someone elses computer
 Becoming aware  Inherent risks and implications?  What needs protection?
7

Awareness ­ Additional strategies to minimize #RSAC Shadow IT
 Someone elses computer
 Discovery includes:  Who  For what purpose  Why
8

#RSAC
Risks and Implications
 Someone elses computer
 Is sensitve content involved  How secure is the provider /
environment  Who has access  What are they doing with the data  Where are are they accessing it
from  Can they take ( download ) data
9

#RSAC
What to protect ?
 Someone elses computer
 Who needs protection  What should be protected  Balance / Usability
10

#RSAC
A different model

 Awareness
 Discovery  Who + What = Why = Alternatives
 Discover risk  How secure is vendor / provider
 Be ready to propose alternatives

Low Risk

Medium Risk

#RSAC
A different model
 Risk
 Data Classification  Know your true risk
 Identify configuration weaknesses
 Privileged user monitoring  Control who has access
 Least privillege model  Understand where the data can
go
12

#RSAC
A different model
 Protection objective
 Users  Devices
13

#RSAC
Use Case ­ Shadow IT
 Users using personal Box accounts to collaborate and share files
 Risk  No control over what data is shared  No control where shared data is going  No control over who is able to share
 Response  Limit who has access to data ­ DRM  Limit where data can go ­ file share ACL  Evaluate what existing alternatives exist ; Adopt Box enterprise  Implement controls for cloud application
14

#RSAC
Use Case ­ Enterprise cloud protection
 Adopted enterprise cloud email solution
 Risks  No visibility into user activities  No method to limit what devices can connect  No method to verify user identity
 Response  Deploy cloud security solution that can
 Audit user activities  Block and control on a per device level  Enforce risk based identity verification
15

#RSAC
Apply
 A new model to address challenges in the cloud
 Can't apply existing models and methods to the cloud  Develop a framework for SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
 Discover and evaluate  Multiple free offerings for cloud application discovery  Measure vendor risk  Understand usage intentions  Identify / propose/ support alternatives
16

#RSAC
Apply
 Reduce risk
 Passive  Monitor all  Regular assessments, know your weaknesses
 Active  Protect accounts  Limit where data can be accessed  Limit where data can be stored  Allow but verify  Block, block, block
17

#RSAC
A different model
 Focus on the big problem  Build a solid foundation  Derive better value  Build the stack

CASB
Cloud Access Security Brokers
 CASB named #1 in top 10 technologies for IT Security in 2014
 By 2017, those making a strategic decision to invest in cloud apps for mission-critical workloads will consider CASB essential
 The CASB market will reach $500 million by year-end 2017
19

#RSAC
CASB Use Cases
 Risk Assessment
 Most of the market in 2014, enterprise customers, all verticals  Offline deployment  3rd party logs, API, or web-access
 Monitoring and Enforcement
 Rapidly catching-up, expected 100% penetration by 2017  Inline deployment  Forward / reverse proxies, SWG integrations, endpoint agents

#RSAC
CASB Deployment Architectures
 SaaS monitoring and protection
 API based analysis  SaaS vendor specific  Not inline ­ zero risk  No ability to interact or block
 Inline based analysis  SaaS vendor specific  Inline risk ­ account for latency and availability  Ability to interact and block
