Abstract Recap
 There have been a huge spate of cyber-attacks recently such as the hacking on Malaysia Airlines. What is clear is that the role of the Chief Information and Security Officer (CISO) is becoming more crucial as security becomes ever more mission critical for business continuity in this era of the Internet of Everything. As the value of sensitive data to organisations and cybercriminals increase, so has the importance of the CISO, in a way barely even imagined a decade ago.
 However, given continued skills shortage in the industry, the problem for firms is finding the right person to fit the job ­ making CISOs hard to find and even harder to keep once their reputation grows. The CISO is now a highly strategic role which has the power to set the tone and vision for information security investments and roadmaps.
 In this talk, David will help outline what exactly constitutes the right person for the role of CISO and what are the crucial attributes a CISO should have. Some of these include:

#RSAC
 Understanding the business and possessing key business skills including risk management and governance. Think about and understand the business objectives and the strategic direction, and how information security enables all this to happen
 Intelligence gathering and analysis:
 Collecting intelligence and analysis will help the organization when it comes to reacting to a breach. This also allows the CISO to outline the impacts of the breach in terms of hard cost and soft cost.
 Business Communication Skills
 Ensure security updates are digestible and easy to understand. It is also worth summarizing it into a short and easy to read report for busy executives, such as the CEO.
 Not forgetting the other employees, language should be weaved into clear policies for them to understand, abide by, and educate.
 Understanding contracts and their security implications, i.e., with cloud service providers, outsourcers, etc.
 The CISO needs to find security issues during the negotiation process and point them out to key stakeholders such as the legal department.
 Identifying new and emerging threats and the solutions to deal with them
