The Challenges Customers are Facing with Identity

Enforce security and compliance without hampering workers

Time and complexity in delivering new apps and
services services

Gaining visibility into user access. Who has access to
when, and when

Complexity of scale and growth (Operations, Helpdesk)

Protecting apps and data from unauthorized access
is important but authentication and ease of
use needs to be straightforward

Employees and their devices are increasingly on the go. Access control to apps becomes more important than networks. Device diversity adds to the
complexity

Real-time visibility, proactive alerting, reporting and analytics are all required to know what apps are being used, when, and
by whom. This helps manage licensing, SLAs, and maintenance
windows

A general state of readiness to scale as traffic, users and devices grow in
number across the organization
