Not a Good Summer for the US Government

"OPM director said stolen passwords for a federal contractor were used by
hackers in the two cyber attacks targeting federal employee data."

"It's really no surprise that the OPM breach was traced back to a compromised credential as this is the case in nearly 80% of the breaches we have seen, including Target and Anthem,"
Idan Tendler, head of Fortscale

Looking Forward
 Technology is only part of the solution  Consider single vendor solutions but only if elements actually work
together  Remember your network extends beyond you
 Remote employees, third party suppliers and contractors  Your employees are the first line of defense ­ Equip and use them  Never assume
 You're fully protected  The network hasn't been breached
