Vulnerability Analysis

Recommendations

#RSAC
Challenges and Recommendations
Control system exposed to the Internet Recommendation
 Next Week:  Check if you system is accessible from other parts of the corporate network or the Internet!
 Next Month:  Create a network architecture diagram  Check if existing architecture diagram is up-to-date and reflects reality  Policy for Remote Connectivity
 Next Quarter:  Network Segmentation, Firewalls and DMZs
25

#RSAC
Challenges and Recommendations
Risk from off-the-shelf software (operating systems, databases, web servers, browsers and others) Recommendation
 Next Week:  Subscribe to vulnerability feeds like ICS-CERT
 Next Month:  Create an inventory of off-the-shelf system components  Request a list of third party components from your vendor
 Ongoing:  Apply experience from IT network security
26

#RSAC
Challenges and Recommendations
Patching, Passwords and Configuration Recommendation
 Next Week:
 Demand quick patches from ICS vendor  Familiarize yourself with reboot procedures and test them if possible
 Next Month:
 Formulate strategy for updates and patches  Enable authentication and authorization per user
 Next Quarter/Year:  Budget a small lab for patch testing. Use factory floor maintenance window
27

#RSAC
Challenges and Recommendations
Older ICS Protocols built for performance (not security) Recommendation
 Next Week:  Create inventory of all ICS protocols used in your system
 Next Month/Quarter:  Enable newer versions as many protocols now support built in security  Policy for modernization and upgrades  Secure wireless connections
