What are we seeing?

Consistent observation: Not ready / as ready

Resource commitment
Outward signs:  Fewer privacy professionals in region  High turnover of privacy professionals  Confused compliance ownership  Reliance on home jurisdiction derived policies  Policy maintenance  Undocumented compliance strategy  Reliance on key man solutions

Awareness
Common issues:  Rate/state of development  Specific local nuances  Application  Consequences/personal liability  Extra-territorial impact  Effective risk allocation  Marketing restrictions  Workplace compliance culture 34  External support inefficient

#RSAC

#RSAC
Different corporate approaches to data protection

The Internally Hamstrung
Reliant on dated EU policies Aware of importance of gear change requirements Internally entangled ­ ownership & budgets Focus on EU policy refresh, gap analysis, country specific business or process specific Afflicted by reactive compliance

Gear Shifters
Reliant on home compliant environment Major gear shift toward standard bearers Building on existing effort Addressing organizational / process design Avoiding reactive cost syndrome Sensitive industries: finance, health

The Standard Bearers
Total organizational control Clear and documented processes Frequently reviewed policies Trained personnel Competitive advantage

Ostriches
View DP as a European issue No recognition of recent changes No resources
35

#RSAC
Your Readiness
 Which category do you fall into?  Do some of our clients challenges resonate with you?  Does each business you operate in Asia have its own privacy rep?  Have your policies been calibrated to regional changes and
differences?  Have you audited regional compliance levels recently?
36

#RSAC
Asia Pac Enforcement Conclusions
 General increase in enforcement actions and level of fines  Explosive growth in new laws  New enforcement in "green field" countries  Regulators given more responsibilities and authority to impose higher
fines  Increased breach notification requirements (e.g. Japan, possibly
Australia)  Requirement for greater accountability  External factors (e.g. Cyber crimes/Data breaches on the rise)
