#RSAC

situations

 "If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how many minutes does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?"

 The answer "100 minutes" leaps to mind (System 1 at work), but it is wrong. But a bit of reflective thought (by System 2) leads to "five minutes," the right answer.

#RSAC

situations

An individual has been described as follows:
"Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with very little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail."
Is Steve more likely to be a librarian, a pilot, surgeon or a farmer?

 Scenario One ­ The test subject was asked to pick between:
 Option A: A 100% chance of losing $3000 or
 Option B: An 80% chance of losing $4000, and a 20% chance of losing nothing.

 Scenario Two ­ Next, choose between:
 Option C: A 100% chance of receiving $3000 or
 Option D: An 80% chance of receiving $4000, and a 20% chance of receiving nothing.

situations

 Scenario One: An epidemic breaks out that is likely to kill 600 people if left untreated.
 Treatment strategy A: will save 200 people.
 Treatment strategy B: has 1/3 chance of saving 600 people and 2/3 chance of saving nobody.

 Scenario Two: An epidemic breaks out that is likely to kill 600 people if left untreated.
 Treatment strategy C: 400 people will die.
 Treatment strategy D: there is a 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die.

 Before finalising a decision, imagine that, a year after it has been made, it has turned out horribly, then write a history of how it went wrong and why

Chapter 3: Persuasion
 People want more of what they can have less of  People are motivated to act by the idea of losing
something rather than gaining that very thing

Chapter 3: Persuasion
 People align with their public commitments  UK Doctors surgery reduced no show
appointments by 18%  "What would you like to achieve?"  "When you made that decision in the past, I have
