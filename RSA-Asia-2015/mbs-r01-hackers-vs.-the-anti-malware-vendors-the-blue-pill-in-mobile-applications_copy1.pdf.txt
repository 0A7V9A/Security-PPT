Popular Malware Detection Techniques

Signature-based

Simple, Low FP, High TP.

Evasion, Zero-Day, Limited.

Static Analysis

Fast, Easy, Cheap.

FP/FN, Run-time, Limited.

Dynamic Analysis

No code, Any app, Run-time

FP/FN, Fix time, Limited.

Bypassing Static Analysis
 Dynamic code loading from a remote website  Reflection
We will share a few code snippets and analyze them with the audience to show
how they trick current static analysis technology.
19

#RSAC
Bypassing Dynamic Analysis
 Time bombs  Am I running in a debugger? [Anti debugging]  Response from the server decides if to go by the "bad path"
20

#RSAC
Benign Apps Behave in a Similar Manner
 Main reasons:
 IP protection  Security by obscurity
 Techniques:
 Dynamic code loading  Anti debugging  ProGuard
