#RSAC
Enterprises don't understand targeted attacks
 Common `wrong' questions asked about targeted attack incident
 What's the detection name?  When did you release a pattern file?  Are we safe from the same sample used against <victim>?  How could they open an attachment in a `suspicious email'?  What's the `silver bullet'?
20

#RSAC
Do we have data to protect? Really?
 Do they have the importance of data defined, and carry out regular audit?

#RSAC
Easy peasy! We are not gonna be targeted!
 `We don't have risks because...'
 `We are not a government or defence agency'  `We are not a recognised brand'  `We are not a large enterprise'  `We don't have data that are valuable'  `We have never been targeted before!'
22

#RSAC
Observations on the current threat landscape
 Attackers are changing tools and tactics to achieve their goal  They are also relying on traditional attack vectors and tactics  Businesses are doing far from enough to protect their data, with
both technologies and people  They have old mind set and misconceptions without grounds  However, attacks are happening against enterprises of all sizes, all
industries
23

#RSAC
Apply what you have learned today
 Next week you should:
 Think about what if attacks happened to `your organisation'
 In the first three months following this presentation you should:
 Assess your current security measures and risks  Define the importance of your data  Raise awareness within your enterprise
 Within six months you should:
 Build incident response capability  Strengthen endpoints and servers with latest security suites  Adopt breach detection capability in-house or outsourced
24

#RSAC
One thing to remember
 Breach will happen, to any size business... including you.

Thank you!
