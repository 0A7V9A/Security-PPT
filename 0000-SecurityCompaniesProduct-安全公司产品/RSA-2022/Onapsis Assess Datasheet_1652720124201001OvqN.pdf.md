ONAPSIS ASSESS
Vulnerability Management for Mission-critical Applications Hosted On-premises, in the Cloud, or SaaS

VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT Onapsis Assess identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in mission-critical applications (hosted on-premises, SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, or hybrid), details the associated business risk and potential impact and provides steps on how to resolve.
Assess helps organizations understand their risk footprint, improve IT and security productivity, and reduce incidents across the landscape.

Onapsis Assess provides Security Teams with an inventory of assets and direct visibility into what problems lie within those assets and their connected systems that can lead to security, compliance, or availability issues. With Assess, organizations gain visibility into where their risk posture lies today and how to trend risk exposure lower over time.
A comprehensive vulnerability management solution for missioncritical applications enables an organization to detect issues sooner, and reduce time spent on false positive investigations and reporting, while ensuring the business is not negatively impacted by risk mitigation activities. Onapsis Assess achieves this through automated assessments, detailed solutions and descriptions of associated risk, workflow orchestration, and integration into key IT components such as ServiceNOW to streamline remediation.
