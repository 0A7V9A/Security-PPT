Make informed mobile app security decisions with real-time threat intelligence
After an Android or iOS app is released, security teams and developers often lack visibility into the most common attack vectors and vulnerable parts of their code...until it's too late. Without this visibility, hackers can have free reign to set up attacks that could expose sensitive customer data, steal code and other intellectual property, cause financial or reputational damage, and more.
ThreatCast, a new mobile app security console for real-time threat monitoring, solves this visibility challenge. With ThreatCast, organizations can detect and analyze threat events happening across iOS and Android apps protected by iXGuard and DexGuard. ThreatCast gives teams continuous insight into their apps' security once they're published and downloaded--areas which have historically been black boxes for organizations.

Analyze environment, application and code threats with ThreatCast

Environment threats These general security threats don't directly target mobile applications, but are often the basis for targeted attacks. For example, your DexGuard or iXGuard protected application detects that it is being run in a potentially harmful environment--such as a rooted or jailbroken device.
Code threats These occur when someone attempts to statically or dynamically alter the internal logic of apps and modify their intended behavior. Code threats are the most explicit indicators that malicious users are targeting specific mobile apps.

Application threats
These are related to the integrity of the application, and indicate that there was an attempt to tamper with the application and possibly modify its behavior. If this happens, DexGuard and iXGuard RASP functionality is automatically triggered to respond to the detected threat.

Leverage your ThreatCast data to strengthen app security

Defend against primary attack vectors DexGuard and iXGuard help you implement security best practices, while ThreatCast allows you to fine-tune your exact security protocols based on real threats.
Optimize response to runtime analysis & live attacks Decide - based on objective data - whether an application should terminate, limit the available functionality, or display a notification when a particular subcategory of threats is detected.

Adjust release frequency to strengthen code protection
DexGuard and iXGuard's applied code protection is different in every build, so attackers must start from zero with each new release. ThreatCast shows you the average time it takes to compromise a new app version, so you can adjust release frequency.
