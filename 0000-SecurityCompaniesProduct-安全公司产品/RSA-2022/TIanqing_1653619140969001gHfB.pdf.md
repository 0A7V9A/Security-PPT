QI-ANXIN Tianqing Endpoint SecurityManagement System

QI-ANXIN Tianqing Endpoint Security Management System (referred to as "Tianqing") offers an integrated endpoint security solution that centers on effectiveness. Its "systematic defense and digital operation" method assists government and corporate clients in precisely identifying, protecting, and supervising endpoints and ensuring that these endpoints can always access data and business in a credible, secure, and legal manner. Based on QI-ANXIN's new "Trantor" endpoint security platform, Tianqing integrates high-performance virus detection, vulnerability

protection, and active defense engines and deeply incorporates innovative technologies such as threat intelligence, big data analysis, and security visualization. Besides, it includes a wide range of functions, including system compliance and reinforcement, threat defense and detection, operation and maintenance control and auditing, endpoint data breach prevention, unified management and operation, etc., to help government and corporate clients build endpoint security capabilities that ensure continued effectiveness.

Integrated capabilities and streamlined management Tianqing employs the integrated design concept, i.e., the integration of platform, function, and management, to significantly streamline the construction, operation, and expansion of the endpoint security system.
Precise control with legal compliance To guarantee that endpoints fulfill applicable internal and external requirements and are truly legally compliant, the management and control of assets, users, behaviors, and data have been refined throughout their lifecycle.

Risk management with closed-loop defense
A close-loop defense for security threats, i.e., the preventive and protective detection and response measures to effectively defend against various known and unknown security threats, has been implemented, thus considerably minimizing security risks.
Obvious effect with needs-based upgrade
Digital operation methods and visual operation tools are offered to deliver endpoint security effects in real time and analyze current deficiencies in a targeted manner, thus improving endpoint security factors as needed.

PRODUCT FUNCTION
System compliance and reinforcements Through conforming security baseline verification, effective vulnerability patch management, unified software management, and timely system reinforcements, the product can check and repair the operating system's security settings,

vulnerability patches, software installation compliance, etc. to minimize the system's exposures and keep it "fit."

Threat defense and detection
Integrated with multiple protection engines and QI-ANXIN's powerful offensive and defensive research capabilities and extensive rule base reserves and production capabilities, the Tianqing can execute real-time interception, efficient detection, accurate positioning, complete source tracing, and effective defense against suspicious behavior, known or unknown viruses, and various attacks. Besides, it can effectively defend against exploits against the outage system to ensure endpoints' constant security.

Endpoint data breach prevention

2022 O cial Sponsor of the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022

According to pre-defined policies, it can scan data in storage and transmission in real time, evaluate if the data violates the pre-defined policies, and automatically take protective actions, including warning, isolation or even blocking, by default; Tianqing is integrated with functions such as asset management, file tracking, and channel management and control and enables endpoint data breach prevention and tracking via security measures, including asset management and control and watermarking.

Endpoint control and auditing
A complete host control and behavior auditing system is built by controlling, operating, maintaining, and auditing the endpoints to enable the multi-level control and audit of the endpoints' external devices, mobile storage devices, system behavior, network behavior, and application processes.

Management and security operations
It provides the unified administration of endpoints throughout the whole network and the unified distribution of policies and tasks via the management center. Meanwhile, it enables digital security operations based on quantitative indicators by using its supporting security management platform.

Function integration Centralized control
The "integration" design concept combined with QI-ANXIN's "Trantor" endpoint centralized management platform allows Tianqing to implement patch management, anti-virus, endpoint management control, detection and response, data breach prevention, and other endpoint security capabilities via only "one client program + one management platform." It offers an integrated endpoint security solution with comprehensive functions, flexible expansion, excellent compatibility, minimal resource usage, and easy operation and maintenance management.

End-to-end collaboration Joint defense and control
Tianqing can share in-depth endpoint data with QI-ANXIN's Tianyan new generation threat perception system, zero-trust security system, Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), Internet Control Gateway (ICG), and other products, offering multi-dimensional access control and decision support for border security products; it can also receive and execute threat handling instructions issued by Tianyan's new generation threat perception system and security operation center, substantially improving the response efficiency of attacks.
