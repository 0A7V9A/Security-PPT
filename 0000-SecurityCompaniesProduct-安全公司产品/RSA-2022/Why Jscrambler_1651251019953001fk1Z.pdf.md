WHY JSCRAMBLER?
 Jscrambler started working on JavaScript code protection in 2009, more than 10 years ago. Many innovative features and patents in this area were introduced by Jscrambler's continuous R&D efforts.
 Jscrambler has both the largest and most powerful set of JavaScript code transformations, many of which are unique, like Jscrambler's Control Flow Flattening, Self-Healing, and robust source maps. Other code protection tools often break your code and are far less resilient.
 The most recent version of Jscrambler introduced JavaScript Threat Monitoring, which actively shows real-time alerts on the Jscrambler dashboard whenever its anti-debugging and anti-tampering features are activated to stop an attack.
 Jscrambler's R&D team has extensive experience working with JavaScript and Application Security. They continuously update Jscrambler to resist all reverse engineering tools and techniques and ensure that it's the most resilient JavaScript protection solution. Resilience can be analyzed with this checklist.
 Jscrambler's technology is very mature, with a sophisticated testing process that ensures every new feature is compatible with all browsers, JS frameworks, and libraries. If a single test fails, our build fails. This means that only pristine releases reach Jscrambler clients.
 Jscrambler offers premium support by JavaScript and Application Security experts that ensure smooth deployments with minimal maintenance required.
 Jscrambler is recognized by Gartner and trusted by thousands of enterprises that have protected over 1 million application builds with Jscrambler.
