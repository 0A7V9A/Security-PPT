Key Features Summary:
· Easily and fully integrates into a company's chosen EFSS, MDM or EMM environment, requiring only one integration per platform.

File Viewer DevKit (FVDK)
The FVDK provides code that can be used to build your own viewer in another product or your own embedded system. The code enables you to open/close files, to move forward/ backward pages, and to render those pages to bitmaps that the caller can then display. FVDK does not include a UI.
Page Viewer DevKit (PVDK)
The PVDK provides the ability to build an internal viewer that can return an image or thumbnail of every page in a document. Like the FVDK, there is no UI. Unlike FVDK, PVDK does not render to the screen; it simply returns an image of document pages.
