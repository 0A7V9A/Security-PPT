As enterprises face a shortage of skilled security professionals, your security teams often spend too much time monitoring and validating alerts, which limits their ability to address other security needs. Even more concerning, when attacks occur, many security analysts are limited by the tools and data available for analysis in their own environment. This is compounded by lack of visibility and context into the history of the event.
VMware Carbon Black Cloud Managed Detection and ResponseTM provides critical insight into attacks with recommendations for the policy changes you need to remediate the threat. Managed detection and response analysts notify you via email of threats and provide specific policy changes to address the threat in VMware Carbon Black CloudTM. In addition, analysts are available to provide you with incident remediation guidance as well as threat containment during an incident.
Built directly on the VMware Carbon Black Cloud platform, Carbon Black Cloud Managed Detection and Response is supported by a world-class team of security experts who monitor and analyze the data in VMware Carbon Black Cloud using advanced machine learning (ML) and algorithmic tool sets.

Protect endpoints with VMware Carbon Black Cloud
Transform your endpoint security with intelligent protection that adapts to your needs. Our cloud native protection platform combines the intelligent system hardening and behavioral prevention needed to keep emerging threats at bay, using a single, easy-to-use console. By analyzing more than 1 trillion security events per day, VMware Carbon Black Cloud proactively uncovers attackers' behavior patterns and empowers defenders to detect and stop emerging attacks.
Most of today's cyberattacks now encompass tactics such as lateral movement, island hopping, and destructive attacks. Advanced hacking capabilities and services for sale on the dark web compound the issue. These realities pose a tremendous risk to targets with decentralized systems protecting high-value assets, including money, intellectual property, and state secrets.
Legacy approaches to prevention leave organizations exposed. Cybercriminals constantly update tactics and obscure their actions within common tools and processes. You need an endpoint protection platform that helps you spot the minor fluctuations that hide malicious attacks and adapt prevention in response.
While other security products only collect a dataset related to known bads, we continuously collect activity data because attackers intentionally try to look normal to hide their attacks. We analyze attackers' behavior patterns to detect and stop never-seen-before attacks.
Protect workloads with VMware Carbon Black Cloud
As organizations continue their journey toward cloud transformation and application modernization, they require modern security solutions that are powerful and easy to operationalize. VMware Carbon Black Cloud WorkloadTM delivers advanced protection purpose-built for securing modern workloads to reduce the attack surface and strengthen security posture.
This innovative solution combines prioritized vulnerability reporting and foundational workload hardening with industry-leading prevention, detection and response capabilities to protect workloads running in virtualized, private and hybrid cloud environments. Reduce your attack surface and protect critical assets with purpose-built workload protection for the modern data center.
Tightly integrated with VMware vSphere®, Carbon Black Cloud Workload provides a seamless lifecycle management experience leveraging VMware ToolsTM. This alleviates installation and management overhead, and consolidates the collection of telemetry for multiple workload security use cases. This unified solution enables security and infrastructure teams to automatically secure new and existing workloads at every point in the security lifecycle, while simplifying operations and consolidating the IT and security stack.
