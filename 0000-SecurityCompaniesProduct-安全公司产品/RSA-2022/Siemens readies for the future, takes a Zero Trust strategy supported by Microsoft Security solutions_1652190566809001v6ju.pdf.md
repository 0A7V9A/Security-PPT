"We chose the best of suite approach with the Microsoft 365 E5 solution, and now we have an overview of our environment that helps us to react in real time and defend against attacks proactively."
.- Thomas Mueller-Lynch, Service Owner Lead for Digital Identity, Siemens

Situation:
When Siemens began to transition to the cloud, it emphasized real-time, proactive security in order to apply a Zero Trust approach. It needed a tightly coordinated set of security solutions to protect identities, data, and endpoints.

Solution:
Already committed to the productivity-enhancing apps in Microsoft 365, it now makes full use of the rich security built into the solution, including Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and more.

Impact:
Siemens is realizing the advantages of an encompassing security system that is worth more than the sum of its parts: a tightly coordinated set of solutions that helps protect company data and about 300,000 devices easily, efficiently--and proactively.
