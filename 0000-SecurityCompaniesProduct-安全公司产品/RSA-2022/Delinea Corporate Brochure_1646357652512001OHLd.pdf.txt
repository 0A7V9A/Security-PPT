Why Choose Delinea
Define the boundaries of access, without the excess.

As organizations continue their digital transformations and move to the cloud, they are faced with increasingly complex privileged access requirements for the expanded threatscape. Privileged access management is complex, but the solution doesn't have to be. At Delinea we believe the opposite of complex isn't simple ­ it's seamless.
Delinea is a leading provider of seamless privileged access management (PAM) solutions that empower cybersecurity for the modern, hybrid enterprise. We believe every user should be treated like a privileged user and wants seamless, secure access, even as administrators want privileged access controls without the excess. Our solutions put privileged access at the center of cybersecurity strategies by defining the boundaries of access.
With Delinea, privileged access is more accessible.

A partner for modern access requirements
Digital transformation, the cloud, and remote working have created new requirements for how to securely access what is needed to be productive, successful, and secure. Access controls are no different than any other cybersecurity tool--no matter who is using it, they just want it to be invisible and to work seamlessly. That's where we excel.
Whether it's IT, security teams, sysadmins, support teams, or developers, our solutions are easy to use and powerful enough to get the people you need on your side.
Engineered for seamless security
Maintain and evolve your privileged access management program with greater confidence and achieve higher stakeholder adoption levels. Our PAM solutions are designed to reduce complexity and minimize costs by helping delineate the boundaries of access.

We're a trusted partner to thousands of organizations around the globe--from small businesses to the Fortune 100--because we make privileged access more accessible for everyone. And we do it while eliminating the need for complex security tools while prioritizing productivity, flexibility, and control.
Whether in the cloud or on-premises, Delinea's solutions are readily customizable, scalable for growth, and powerful enough to secure your organization no matter where it is on its PAM maturity journey.
