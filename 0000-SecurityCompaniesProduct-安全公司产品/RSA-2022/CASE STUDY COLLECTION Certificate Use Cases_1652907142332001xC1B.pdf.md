CERTIFICATE USE CASES
HID PKI-AS-A-SERVICE HID PKIaaS helps enterprises manage machines, virtual servers connected to their networks and IoT devices. Using the security of PKI as the foundation, HID PKIaaS is perfect for addressing many customer needs across a wide range of industries and use cases. These use cases can be as simple as securing websites, securing email communications or digitizing paper-based processes using digital certificates; they can be as complex as securing network end points or securing connected IoT devices. Let's take an at-a-glance look at how several companies across multiple industries have benefitted from HID PKIaaS.
-C A S E S T U D Y

A FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY
Profile: A nationwide financial institution was using multiple certificate providers and inconsistently used an internal certificate authority (CA) platform responsible for outages. Diverse sets of certificate requestors were being managed by a central group with a desire to consolidate trusted and internal certificate issuance platforms without giving up investment in Microsoft management tools.
Need: The organization has a number of external websites that require Extended Validation SSL certificates. They also implemented a Microsoft CA a number of years ago for their internal network hosts infrastructure which has since grown into a mission-critical service. They do not have dedicated PKI resources and were looking to outsource the operations and management of the private key material while still being able to leverage native Microsoft tools for cert management and deployment.
Solution: HID provided a self-service Account Certificate Manager (ACM) that allowed the financial services company to issue and manage both trusted SSL and private-trust internal certificates from one interface. In addition, HID provided integration with Microsoft CA to automate certificate issuance and management.
Benefit: The organization now has a single place to manage all their certificate types and can still use autoenrollment, network device enrollment and any other tool that can integrate with a Microsoft CA.
A UTILITY COMPANY
Profile: A global utility infrastructure provider that manufactures smart meters required a private PKI infrastructure to provide certificates for both their products and the tools that communicate with them.
Need: Manufacturing millions of devices each year, the company needed a highlyscalable certificate solution that could be utilized by their existing key generation and certificate request capability. Due to constraints in storage, processing power and connectivity it was critical to choose a provider that could support a highlycustomized Elliptic Curve (ECC) certificate profile.
Solution: Using the HID's Certificate RESTful API, the company is able to send certificate signing requests to cloud-based PKI-as-a-Service and receive the certificate back in a single authenticated session at volumes that far exceed their requirements. The solution also includes the Account Certificate Manager for issuance of low-volume certificates for both "command and control" systems and code signing.
Benefit: The inherent scalability of the service enabled a phased rollout of certificate volume without requiring the company to make a significant investment up front for capacity that may not be fully utilized in the first year or two of operation.

A TRANSPORTATION COMPANY
Profile: A nationwide transportation company with a centralized IT function that determined the policies and procedures for certificate issuance generally delegated the actual request process to local administrators.
Need: The organization has a rapidly expanding trusted SSL and user certificate infrastructure. They implemented the Venafi TrustAuthorityTM key and certificate management platform for administration and policy enforcement but needed a fullservice PKI provider for the on-demand issuance of both server and user certificates as well as a predictable cost model.
Solution: HID provided a self-service Account Certificate Manager that allows the customer to manage the types of certificates that can be issued by the Venafi platform and can deliver digital-signing certificates to end users independent of Venafi licensing requirements. We also provided an HID adaptable CA driver built-in to the Venafi platform for fully automated issuance of both trusted SSL and digital-signing certificates.
Benefit: The organization now has a single vendor for all their certificate needs and a yearly subscription fee that removes the need to manage certificate credits and associated out-of-cycle budget expenditures.
AN INTERNATIONAL GAMING ENTERPRISE
Profile: A large commercial gaming enterprise with high-volume internal certificate demands to meet application DevOps requirements and a large stable of internet domains required to protect all host systems.
Need: Requiring both trusted SSL and internal certificates, the company desired a fully-branded private PKI solution with an offline Root CA and multiple online issuing CAs. They implemented the Venafi Trust Authority key and certificate management platform for administration and policy enforcement but needed a full-service PKI provider for the on-demand issuance of both trusted SSL and internal certificates.
Solution: HID provided a self-service Account Certificate Manager that allows the customer to manage the types of certificates that can be issued by the Venafi platform. The HID adaptable CA driver is now built-in to the Venafi platform for fully automated issuance of both trusted SSL and internal certificates.
Benefit: The organization has a single vendor for all their certificate needs that includes the ongoing protection and management of their offline Root CA.
HID PKIaaS Eases the Implementation and On-Going Operations for All Use Cases
HID PKIaaS helps enterprises leverage the power of PKI to better protect their networks. It secures every device that accesses your network -- even within a complex ecosystem. Certificate-based security easily integrates with core business applications and with management functions accessible in the cloud. Plus, robust automation features across use cases take the burden of enrolling devices and updating certificates away from your IT resources. With the shift to short-lived certificates, not automating is not an option.
