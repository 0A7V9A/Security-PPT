BE PREPARED WHEN ATTACKERS STRIKE
Cyber incident simulations are essential to keep your organization from being blindsided. If you haven't tested your incident management program with cyber exercises, you might not be prepared when hit with a security incident or data breach. Take the guesswork out of your response plan and protect your organization. Test your people, processes and technology with a tabletop exercise to prepare before disaster strikes.

BUILD CYBERSECURITY READINESS SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE

Cyber exercises are valuable for evaluating existing security defenses, testing new procedures and establishing a fundamental method for training your security personnel on evolving threats like ransomware.
Our team uses their real-world expertise to develop engaging, discussion-based tabletop exercises. Tailored, scenario-based engagements can improve your ability to detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents faster.

Exercises can include executive-level or practitioner exercises, or both, based on your goals. Expert facilitators host each session and provide in-depth post-exercise summary reports along with detailed recommendations for improvement.
We can provide turn-key events and build programs ranging from a single tabletop exercise to a series of exercises, all with no impact on network operations.

KEY FEATURES
EVALUATE ACTUAL VERSUS PERCEIVED CAPABILITIES
Tabletop exercises enable participants to walk through the who, what, when, where and how of a situation in a safe environment before an actual emergency occurs. Tabletops can be used at any level (management through the individual contributor level) and test what participants actually know about processes and procedures and how they might react in a crisis. This type of exercise can also be good for reviewing documented procedures to see if they work and if there are any documentation gaps.

DETERMINE WHERE TO INVEST SECURITY BUDGETS
Tabletop exercises can help you identify gaps in personnel, technology and processes to determine where to best invest limited cybersecurity funds. For example, are staff adequately trained, or is it time to invest in classes on cloud security? Do you need to replace outdated hardware and software to reduce your risks? Could you benefit from expert cybersecurity consulting services to conduct pentests or gap assessments? Could 24/7 managed security services reduce your operating expenses?
BUILD MUSCLE MEMORY AND REDUCE STRESS
Reducing stress in IT security comes from understanding threats and how you're vulnerable. It also comes from understanding how your IT, systems operations and other teams will work together to deal with an incident. Cyber exercises can be used to discuss and or practice your cybersecurity processes and give you confidence in your plan. Work through the `what if' and worst-case scenarios and identify any gaps in your plan to address before they become critical issues.
MEET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Depending on your industry, you may have regulatory requirements that can be met through a cyber exercise. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires training for all personnel that handle Protected Health Information (PHI). The requirements for data storage and protection fall directly on the cyber team(s). A cyber exercise can and should include these requirements to meet the regulatory requirements.
