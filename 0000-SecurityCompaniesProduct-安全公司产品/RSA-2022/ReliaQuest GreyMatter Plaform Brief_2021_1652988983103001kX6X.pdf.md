PLATFORM BRIEF
RELIAQUEST GREYMATTER:
OPERATIONALIZE SECURITY WITH OPEN XDR-AS-A-SERVICE

Enterprise security teams struggle with limited integration across tools, leading to a lack of visibility into data, processes, and risk. Thus, they are mired in manual processes, slow response times, and the inability to confidently implement automation. This leaves them stuck being reactive and unable to effectively detect and respond to threats or proactively advise the business.
The result: inefficiencies lead to increased risk to the business.

A majority of security teams have reached the tipping point where the number of security tools in place is so burdensome it adversely impacts security posture and increases risk.*

THE SOLUTION:
ReliaQuest GreyMatterTM, a cloud-native platform, unifies telemetry from any security solution, regardless of vendor or data location, for unified detection, investigation, response, and resilience, delivered with 24/7/365 security expertise.
INCREASE VISIBILITY · Data on demand · One centralized, user-friendly view · Operationalize existing technology
DECREASE COMPLEXITY · Alert-level automation · Codified best practices · Ensures optimal performance of current investments
MANAGE RISK · Track improvement in tools,
teams, and processes · Detection mapped to business risks, use
cases, and technologies

For years, vendors have promised to deliver a `single pane of glass,' but always fell short. ReliaQuest GreyMatter unifies security tools for visibility across layers, aggregated alerting, faster investigation and response, bolstered by proactive threat hunting and attack simulation to continually improve your posture, all wrapped with security advisory expertise for accelerating key initiatives. ­ John Childers, Director, Information Security, Aqua America
