Risk Cloud® Integrations
Risk Cloud adapts seamlessly to how your company already works.
Get Connected
Risk Cloud works with the tools and technology you use every day so you can hit the ground running. What does that look like for you? Avoid a learning curve, accelerate adoption, and get a truly holistic GRC experience. From plug-and-play to customized functionality, integrate your current tech stack into Risk Cloud.
Integration Types
1. Native Integrations Integrate with the technology you already rely on for your most important governance, risk, and compliance tasks. Native integrations are available in Risk Cloud through an API token ready for you to use. 2. Risk Cloud Connectors We wanted to make things easier, so we created a bunch of pre- and custom-built integrations to help you tackle common GRC use cases. Efficiency is waiting for you. 3. API Access With LogicGate's Open REST API, you can connect to any desired integration. Offering the most flexible and advanced level of integration, you can create exactly what you want.
