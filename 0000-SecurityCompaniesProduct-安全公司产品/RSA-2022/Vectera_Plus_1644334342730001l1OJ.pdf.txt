Hardware Security Module

General Purpose Hardware Security Module
Advanced HSM Technology for Cross-Industry Applications
The Vectera Plus is a general purpose hardware security module that excels in the most demanding cryptographic processing environments. The Vectera Plus combines high processing speeds and support for the world's most advanced encryption algorithms within a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated secure cryptographic device. With speed, scalability, and redundancy, the Vectera provides physically robust security that meets and exceeds all relevant compliance standards. From securing databases and applications to protecting sensitive intellectual property and customer data, the Vectera Plus fills incredibly varied roles across innumerable industries.

The Vectera Plus combines the best of both general purpose and financial data processing. The benefits of this multifunctional hardware are wide-ranging: reduced up-front capital expenditure, lower overhead costs for maintenance, simplicity of training, and reduced time involved in integrating cryptographic functionality with client applications.

Secure Code Environment
The Vectera Plus' Secure Code Environment provides a powerful, versatile, and extensible solution for organizations wishing to develop their own applications and operate them from within a secure, isolated, FIPS 140-2 Level 3-compliant environment.
The Vectera Plus offers a high level of flexibility in the application development process and provides an easy method for organizations to increase the value of their HSM infrastructure by developing applications in Java, PKCS #11, Microsoft CNG, and many other common cryptographic libraries.
Dynamic HSM Virtualization
· HSM virtualization allows a single Vectera Plus to function as multiple logically separated virtual HSMs, each with their own customizable firmware, security policy, and configurations.
