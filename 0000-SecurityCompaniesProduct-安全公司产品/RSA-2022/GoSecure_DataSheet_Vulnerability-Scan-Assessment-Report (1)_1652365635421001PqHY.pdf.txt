GOSECURE TITAN® VULNERABILITY SCAN ASSESSMENT REPORT
Understanding your organization's security gaps and how to address them

HIDDEN SECURITY GAPS
Organizations struggle to keep pace with the ever-increasing threat landscape and the targeting of vulnerabilities. The result is that even critical patches can take months to deploy. According to the MITRE.org database, more than 50 vulnerabilities were logged every day on average in 2021 which means that risks from vulnerabilities are continuously being compounded. Most organizations lack the time, tools, and expertise to effectively manage vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these shortcomings are often revealed through a breach or other time-consuming incident. Uncover those hidden security gaps before it's too late.
