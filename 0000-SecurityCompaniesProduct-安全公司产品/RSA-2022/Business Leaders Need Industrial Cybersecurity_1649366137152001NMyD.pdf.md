EXECUTIVE BRIEF
Business Leaders Need to Quickly Shift Focus to Industrial Cybersecurity

Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and strategic industrial assets are one of the top five global risks, according to the executives and world leaders who participated in the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Risk Report.1
To keep critical systems running and protect the financial results and reputation of your organization, it is essential to improve industrial cybersecurity. Cyberattacks have cost companies millions of dollars through the disruption of services and critical operations. Without visibility and cybersecurity, customer and employee safety are at risk.
Today's business leaders are expected to protect the entire organization beyond enterprise IT systems, including operational technology (OT) environments.

Focus on Industrial Cybersecurity

Two of the most important measures you can take to mitigate OT risk are to bring together your IT and OT teams and invest in new technology designed to improve the visibility and cyber resilience of industrial networks.
Why align IT and OT? Because the technologies they use are converging and their systems are becoming more and more connected. When IT and OT join forces, there is an opportunity to reduce risk and cost, and speed projects.
Why invest in new OT technology? Because it improves reliability and cybersecurity, as well as staff productivity and teamwork ­ and it is much simpler than you might expect, delivering nearly immediate ROI.
Learn how taking these two important steps can help you proactively reduce cyber risks, including damage that could be caused by cyberattacks.

What Drives IT/OT Convergence?

The Industrial Internet of Things The computing landscape of today is characterized by increasing connectivity and data sharing between disparate systems. It also involves data flows between local applications and cloud-based applications, where sophisticated analytics may be done.
Similarly, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 are both trends that involve connecting smart devices and sharing the data they produce to improve existing business models and enable new ones. Benefits include reduced costs, improved productivity, energy savings and faster response to customer demand.
While bringing many benefits, the IIoT also increases cyber risks. Traditionally insecure industrial systems, which include many legacy assets, are now exposed to the type of threats that IT has been dealing with for years. Complicating the picture is the dramatic rise in cyberattacks specifically targeting critical infrastructure and manufacturing systems.
Executive Concerns about Cyber Risks Are Increasing A 2018 Marsh report2 found three-quarters of energy executives worry about cyberattacks interrupting their business operations. Physical damage is the cyber loss scenario of greatest concern. As a consequence, most of the executives surveyed are preparing to increase their investments in cyber risk management.
And, both the U.S. and U.K. governments have issued warnings around state-sponsored attacks targeting critical network infrastructure.

Other examples of the business costs related to cyberattacks on industrial networks include:
· Merck: $780M losses from production shutdown, lost sales and remediation costs3
· Maersk: $300M losses from business interruption, lost revenues and remediation costs4
· FedEx: $300M in lost earning for one quarter, with additional losses to follow5
With the IIoT trend increasing cyber exposure for industrial networks, and cyberattacks increasingly becoming the tool of choice for nation states and cyber criminals, losses continue to increase.
Countering Cyber Risk with IT/OT Convergence To reduce cyber risks related to industrial systems, it is essential that IT and OT teams combine forces. IT personnel generally have better cybersecurity and cloud expertise, whereas OT staff know how to keep cyber-physical processes running. Collaboration between the groups reduces cybersecurity blind spots and costs.
However, as any initiative that involves people and process, making it happen takes strong direction and ongoing leadership commitment.
Depending upon an organization's convergence maturity level, executives should set appropriate goals. This can include things like having one executive responsible for both IT and OT, facilitating cross-training, and insisting on as much common technology between the groups as possible.

80% of the industrial facilities we visit do not have up-to-date lists of assets or network diagrams. The first step to better cybersecurity is better visibility of OT infrastructure. Our solution is easy to deploy and combines superior operational visibility and best-in-class threat detection. The ROI is very fast, delivered through increased productivity, enhanced cybersecurity and the use of a common tool for both IT and OT.

Why Invest in the Nozomi Networks Solution?

Solution Designed for OT, Benefits OT, IoT and IT As the cybersecurity risk to critical infrastructure and manufacturing organizations increases, it is important for enterprises to actively monitor and secure OT networks.
An important aspect of this is having complete visibility to OT networks and assets and their cybersecurity and process risks.
IT solutions do not apply as they do not meet the unique challenges of managing 24/7/365 operational systems where availability is often a bigger concern than confidentiality or integrity.
Nozomi Networks is the OT and IoT security and visibility vendor of choice because we thoroughly understand industrial networks and processes. Our technology is completely safe for industrial control systems (ICS) and delivers superior visibility, real-time network monitoring and threat detection in a passive, non-intrusive manner. It also integrates seamlessly with IT infrastructure, easily sharing data with existing applications and assets.
Our company has innovated the use of artificial intelligence to automate inventorying, visualizing, monitoring and identifying threats to OT networks. The result is improved cyber resiliency and reliability.
Immediate Value Delivered to Multinational Organizations Unlike some enterprise-class applications, deployment of the Nozomi Networks solution is straightforward and starts providing ROI quickly. Here is why:
· It is a passive solution that is completely safe for industrial networks and processes.
· It is a mature, 4th generation solution that is ISO9001:2105 certified and quick to deploy.
· It immediately brings benefits by identifying existing threats in the industrial network and improving the productivity of operations and IT staff.
Example Time Savings of One Employee · It readily scales to monitor hundreds of facilities and
thousands of devices from a central location. · It integrates easily with IT/OT infrastructure, supporting
existing investments in technology and skills.
