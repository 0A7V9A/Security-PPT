DATASHEET

Cloud security requires a deeper understanding of the shared responsibility model between the customer and cloud provider. Current products use solutions designed for the on-premises environment and do not provide complete visibility of cloud security posture.
The current products are challenging to scale, need an update, and have management dependency on the security team. These tools for cloud security follow a fragmented approach.
The frequency of alerts from point security tools are in silos and cannot give endto-end visibility on the comprehensive security posture of the enterprise business. Agentless solutions can help bridge the gap in the cloud environment.
Xcloud's agentless technology finds the most elusive threats across your entire cloud and container environments. With nothing to install, deploy, or configure Xcloud keeps you secure automatically.
Xcloud combines multiple security tools into a single comprehensive platform to bring unparalleled risk visibility and essential insights into the risks that threaten your cloud and container environments. Within minutes security teams can discover vulnerabilities, find malware, detect misconfigurations, and monitor the state of your cloud compliance. Once risks are found our prioritization engine highlights the most damaging issues so you can quickly and efficiently remediate.
