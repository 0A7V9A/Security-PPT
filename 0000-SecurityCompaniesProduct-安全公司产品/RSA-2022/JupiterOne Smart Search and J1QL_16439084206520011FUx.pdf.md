How JupiterOne Smart Search Works
Search for the "what". A simple search for a user's full name returns account access, devices in use, resources, and even changes to code repositories made by the user.
Understand the "so what". JupiterOne connects and visualizes the relationships between assets, for example specific users and identities to the resources they own and utilize.
Prioritize and act to mitigate risk. Take immediate or automated action on vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or risks that don't align with your compliance or security policies.

Use JupiterOne Smart Search in one of three easy ways:
1 Full text search and ask natural language
questions by typing in keywords to search across all pre-built and saved text matches and questions. Search for cloud accounts, asset names, usernames, device IDs, IP addresses, instance ID, vulnerability IDs, and more. And ask questions such as: Who are my vendors? What lambda functions do I have in AWS? Who has access to a specific cloud workload? It's as easy as typing in your question.
2 JupiterOne query language (J1QL) is a
simple query language for querying data created by JupiterOne. J1QL seamlessly blends simplified full-text search and graph queries for precise querying of your entities and relationships; this is for teams who want

a deeper, more robust analysis capability to their most sophisticated questions.
3 Visual Query Builder helps teams build
queries with simple drag and drop icons and asset visualizations within seconds. Build complete visualization and understanding into your environment and cyber asset relationships without the code.
