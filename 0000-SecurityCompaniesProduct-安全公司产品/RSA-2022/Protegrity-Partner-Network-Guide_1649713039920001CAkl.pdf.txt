1.0 About Protegrity
WE PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA in such a way that the right people can use it and the wrong people can't. And this protection applies across IT platforms and beyond...
Protegrity is for world-leading organizations that hold and use large volumes of sensitive data (and are likely under regulatory pressures) who are trying to maximize the value of this data by applying it to the critical initiatives that will transform and grow their business. Organizations struggle to balance the need for widespread data access and sharing against the burden of compliance and the necessity of robust data protection. We provide a platform that gives organizations precision control over how data is protected, and who can access it, at a field level.
Unlike other data protection solutions, we protect data wherever it goes ­ across platforms and external systems. The Protegrity platform is quick, robust, and built to be integrated with any existing IT infrastructure (including micro-services).
For the first time, organizations can get the most from their sensitive data, without compromising on security. And when sensitive data flows across the organization, it accelerates the initiatives that push business forward.

2.0 Partner Network Overview
Protegrity Partner Network makes customer adoption of a partner's solution and services a smooth and seamless process. The requirements of the program, not to mention who benefits from maximized customer success, encompass two types of partners: SERVICES PARTNERS AND TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS. The network enables all those in our ecosystem to work with Protegrity and our joint customers in a variety of engagement models:
1. Services partners provide customers with Protegrity-related services such as technical, advisory, and implementation services. These partners include systems integrators, value-added resellers, and distributors. Services partners may refer new business or become eligible to resell the Protegrity platform.
2. Technology partners typically integrate software with the Protegrity platform and take the friction out of implementing a joint solution at a customer. These partners include independent software vendors (ISVs), as well as cloud hyperscalers.
Participation in in the program is subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Protegrity Partner Agreement (Protegrity Partner Network Agreement) and to the policies, guidelines, and terms described in the network tiers outlined in this document. To join the Protegrity Partner Network, go to www.protegrity.com/partners and complete the application form. Protegrity will review all applications and reply accordingly.

6.0 Joint Marketing with Protegrity

The Protegrity Partner Portal has developed several joint marketing opportunities and removed the usual friction that can surface with go-to-market resources. Specifically, we have developed co-branded assets in which the partner can add their content to create jointly branded content like a solution brief. In addition, we will introduce additional joint content based on partner demand.
