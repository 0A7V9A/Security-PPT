YubiKey 5 FIPS Series: FIPS 140-2 Validation Ensures Strong Security and Compliance

The YubiKey 5 FIPS Series is the first FIPS validated FIDO2/WebAuthn, multi-protocol authenticator lineup. From left to right: YubiKey 5 NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5C NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5Ci FIPS, YubiKey 5C FIPS, YubiKey 5 Nano FIPS and YubiKey 5C Nano FIPS.

Relying solely on username and password security puts enterprise data at risk
Catastrophic security breaches top world headlines every day, and for good reason. The cost of global cybercrime expected to be $6 trillion in 2021, an increase from $3 trillion in 20151, and 81% of breaches are caused by stolen or weak passwords.2 As a result, IT organizations can't rely exclusively on passwords to protect access to corporate data. They have to adopt stronger employee and vendor authentication--or risk becoming the next target.
The YubiKey 5 FIPS Series eliminates account takeovers
The YubiKey FIPS lineup makes it easy to deploy strong, scalable authentication that eliminates account takeovers from phishing attacks. The YubiKey is a hardware-based solution that:
 Offers multiple authentication and cryptographic protocols including FIDO2/WebAuthn, FIDO U2F, Personal Identity Verification-compatible (PIV) Smart Card, OpenPGP, and Yubico One-Time Password (OTP) to protect employee access to computers, networks, and online services with just one touch
 Support passwordless secure login with smart card and FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication
 Works across major operating systems including Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux, as well as leading browsers
 Available in a choice of six form factors that enable users to connect via USB-A, USB-C, NFC and Lightning

YubiKey has been the trusted choice of Google, Facebook, and Salesforce since 2012
Delivers strong multi-factor authentication: The YubiKey combines hardware-based authentication and public key cryptography to ensure strong authentication and eliminate account takeovers. Capabilities include FIDO2/WebAuthn and FIDO U2F, open authentication standards supported by the FIDO Alliance, as well as Smart Card functionality based on the PIV interface specified in NIST SP 800-73.
Reduces IT costs: After evaluating data gathered from a deployment of more than 50,000 YubiKeys in 70 countries, Google found that the device's ease of use and reliability reduced password support incidents by 92%. This saves the company thousands of hours per year in support costs.3
Provides easy, fast, and reliable security for employees: YubiKey hardware is reliable because it does not require a battery or network connectivity, so it's always on and accessible. Authentication is fast with a simple touch that is four times faster than SMS and mobile two-factor authentication.
Since deploying the YubiKey in 2010, Google has experienced:
 Zero account takeovers  4x faster logins  92% fewer IT support calls

YubiKey: Proven, easy-to-use security that's trusted by the world's leading companies

Phishing defense for secure enterprise authentication
The YubiKey stores the authentication secret on a secure element hardware chip. This secret is never transmitted and therefore cannot be copied or stolen.
Reduces IT costs
The YubiKey dramatically reduces the number one IT support cost--password resets--which cost Microsoft over $12M per month.4
By switching from mobile OTPs to YubiKeys, Google reduced password support incidents by 92% because YubiKeys are more reliable, faster, and easier to use.

Easy to deploy
IT can deploy YubiKeys in days, not months. A single key can access several modern and legacy systems, which eliminates the need for separate keys or extra integration work.

Easy to use, fast, and reliable
Users don't need to install anything--customers or employees simply register their own YubiKey, enter their username and password as usual, and plug in and tap the YubiKey when prompted.
The YubiKey 5 NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5C NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5Ci FIPS and YubiKey 5C FIPS conveniently fit on a keyring, while the YubiKey 5 Nano FIPS and YubiKey 5C Nano FIPS are designed to remain in the USB port. This ensures every YubiKey is easy to access and provides the same level of digital security. The YubiKey 5 NFC FIPS / 5 Nano FIPS are crush-resistant and water-resistant.

YubiKey capabilities: These functions are included in the YubiKey 5 NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5C NFC FIPS, YubiKey 5Ci FIPS, YubiKey 5C FIPS, YubiKey 5 Nano FIPS and YubiKey 5C Nano FIPS security keys.
