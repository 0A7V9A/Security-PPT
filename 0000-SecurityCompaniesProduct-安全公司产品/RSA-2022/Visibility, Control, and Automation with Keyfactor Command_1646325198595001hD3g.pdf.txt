DATASHEET

Shift to cloud-native certificate
lifecycle automation
Today, hybrid and multi-cloud are the norm. However, regulatory or policy needs require some organizations to keep all or part of their public key infrastructure (PKI) on-premise. With Keyfactor Command Certificate Lifecycle Automation as a Service (CLAaaS), teams can discover and manage certificates across public CAs, cloud-based CAs, and private PKI behind their firewall -- all from the cloud.

"The SaaS model has us running with 100% uptime and 0% infrastructure footprint..."

Key Benefits

Prevent certificate outages and blindspots
Get complete visibility of every certificate issued from cloudbased, public, and on-premise private CAs -- all from a single SaaS platform.

Eliminate manual, errorprone processes
Reduce hours of manual work to just a few clicks -- or no clicks -- with automated issuance, renewal, and deployment.

Deploy fast and scale without limits
Get all the advantages of Keyfactor Command without the need to run the server, database and software on-prem.

Key Capabilities
Get full visibility of every certificate, everywhere
Keyfactor automates the discovery and inventory of certificates across on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments via the Remote CA GatewayTM, AnyCA GatewaysTM, network-based discovery, and direct integrations to your key and certificate stores.

HOW IT WORKS
Keep your PKI
The Remote CA GatewayTM securely integrates with onprem PKI behind your firewall.
Stay Secure
No complex VPN or firewall setup -- it requires just a single API connection over port 443.

Manage Remotely
Manage your on-prem PKI via the cloud to issue, enroll, renew and revoke certificates.

Easily track and monitor certificates all in one place
Group certificates by business need, application, or team, tag them with unique metadata, and create automated alerts and workflows to renew before expiration. Simplify audits with scheduled reports for certificate owners and auditors

"I can view all my CAs from a single screen. Keyfactor allows me to issue and revoke certificates quickly."

Define policies and role-based access controls
Integrate with AD or your identity provider to define granular role-based access and permissions. Set rules for certificate enrollment, key generation and retention, and more. Meanwhile, you'll have a complete audit log of all user and certificaterelated activities.

"Keyfactor Command is a single stop shop to manage CAs in multiple environments."
Ernesto T Sr. IAM Analyst

Enable self-service and lifecycle automation
Give your teams the ability to generate, request, and issue certificates from any CA via self-service UI or REST API. Use agentless orchestrators to automate issuance, renewal, provisioning, and installation of certificates to endpoints.
