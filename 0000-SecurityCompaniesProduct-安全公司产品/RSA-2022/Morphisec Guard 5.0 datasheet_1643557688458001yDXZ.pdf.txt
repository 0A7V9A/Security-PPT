Proactive Endpoint Protection with Morphisec Guard
For too long, cybersecurity vendors have focused on detecting and responding to threats that bypass traditional antivirus. These detection-centric tools have proven to be ineffective despite their high cost and skill requirements to operate. Morphisec Guard is a more effective and lower cost alternative that works immediately and automatically.
Morphisec Guard works on top of the security controls that are built into Windows 10 by adding patented moving target defense technology to your endpoint security stack. This prevents the threats that are designed to bypass status quo prevention and detection mechanisms. Furthermore, Morphisec Guard adds visibility, control, and antitampering to Windows's native security controls including antivirus, drive encryption, firewall, and device control.
Improve your endpoint security and simplify your operations with the lowest possible TCO.

Earliest Stage, Proactive Endpoint Protection
Morphisec Guard extends your prevention capabilities beyond that of any other antivirus through Moving Target Defense by creating a zero-trust execution environment. By morphing memory resources only trusted code can run so advanced threats are prevented even when there is no known signature or behavioral pattern. Additionally, rich forensic information is captured for teams who need it.

KEY BENEFITS
PREVENT ALL MODERN THREATS True prevention that extends beyond antivirus means stopping fileless attacks, exploits, and zero days without the need for manual investigation and remediation.
DON'T PAY FOR WHAT YOU HAVE Morphisec Guard brings enterprise grade visibility and control to Windows' native antivirus, drive encryption, firewall, and device control.
CONSOLIDATE YOUR STACK Morphisec Guard offers a complete endpoint security solution with one agent that is managed through the Morphisec Security Center -- a single pane of glass.
SET AND FORGET The cloud deployed, user mode agent is easily installed without requiring a reboot. Endpoints are immediately protected without anyconfiguration required.
ELIMINATE SYSTEM IMPACT The 3MB stateless agent consumes zero CPU and works silently so end users machine performance will be unaffected.
AVOID MANUAL EFFORTS No false alerts and no need to investigate or remediate means Guard will secure your business automatically and immediately.

MORPHISEC GUARD: PROACTIVE ENDPOINT PROTECTION

Security Without Compromise
Cut your security risk and costs without cutting into business operations or productivity. Morphisec is built from the ground up to align business and security needs.
Morphisec Guard is a single agent solution that fully maximizes Windows' native security features, with no runtime component and no performance impact. It runs autonomously so your endpoints are always protected, even when not connected to your company's network. The Morphisec Security Center, an on-premises or cloud-based management console, provides end-to-end visibility into organization-wide threats, including file-based and fileless threats, and effortless control over settings and functionality.

How It Works
Morphisec creates a zero-trust execution environment by morphing the application memory. This changes the memory structure of your applications so only trusted code is allowed to execute. By doing this, Morphisec prevents zero days, fileless attacks, in-memory exploits, and evasive malware.
Additionally, Morphisec Guard takes control of native Windows' antivirus (Defender), drive encryption (BitLocker), personal firewall, and device control. By adding visibility, control, and antitampering to native OS security, you don't have to pay for what you already have. Achieve better protection while reducing costs.

Secure Everything
Morphisec Guard secures your physical, and virtual endpoints, including VMware Horizon View and Citrix. Visit www.morphisec.com to learn more or email demo@morphisec.com for a closer look.
