How We Hunt 24/7
We operate with a zero-trust philosophy to defend your business from evolving threats. Our cloud-native XDR platform, eSentire Atlas, provides processing scale and speed to combat emerging threats by ensuring that new detections across every customer environment are immediately translated to protect our entire global customer base. We call that the eSentire Security Network Effect.
eSentire Atlas is the foundation of our MDR service, providing security, reliability and redundancy at scale, and on-demand. Leveraging patented Machine Learning models and proprietary artificial intelligence threat hunting applications, Atlas automatically disrupts over 3M threats daily. When an automated disruption isn't possible, Atlas arms our 24/7 Security Operations Center Analysts and Elite Threat Hunters with the enriched intel to perform deep investigations and execute manual containment, when required, in minutes.
The Result? We stop threats before they impact your business.
