The Developer's Guide to an Easier Life
You Code. We Renovate.

Why should I update my dependencies?
Ensuring your dependencies are kept up to date is one of the easiest ways to keep your software secure and reduce your technical debt. Yet, most developers find the process painful.
What is Renovate?
Renovate is an open source tool by Mend for developers and DevOps that automatically creates pull requests (PRs) for dependency updates. Our PRs embed all the information you need to ease your update decision. Renovate keeps your open source, internal, and cloud-native dependencies up-to-date with the latest versions to improve security, maintainability, and overall functionality.
How does Renovate work?
1. Scans your repos to detect dependencies (support for more than 65 package managers)
2. Checks if newer versions exist 3. Raises PRs for available updates with crowdsourced tests status,
package adoption data, release notes, and commit histories.

4 reasons to automate dependency updates with Renovate
Save time. Developers save up to 20 percent of their development time by automating their dependency updates.
Improve your zero-day readiness. In the event of a zeroday vulnerability, you'll be able to simply apply the fix, instead of dealing with a complex upgrade.
Improve security. Over 90 percent of new vulnerabilities are fixed with security patches before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed. These newly disclosed vulnerabilities are prevented by maintaining up-todate dependencies.

Stop worrying about breaking your build. Crowd-sourced Merge Confidence and package adoption data are used to identify whether an update can be safely merged or contains potential risk.

Get started with 3 simple steps
1. Go to the GitHub Marketplace and install the Renovate app.
2. Select the repos you would like Renovate to scan. An onboarding PR will be created for each repo you select.
3. The onboarding PR contains a preview of the actions Renovate will take. Review them and merge the PR.
Just like that, no configuration needed, you're up and running!
