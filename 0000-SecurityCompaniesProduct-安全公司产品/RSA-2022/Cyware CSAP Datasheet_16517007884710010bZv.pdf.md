Cyware Situational Awareness Platform (CSAP)

A real-time threat information sharing and communication platform for faster and better informed cyber threat response
More and more, security teams are putting their businesses at ever-greater risk by failing to keep up with the increasing volume of alerts and to comprehend these risks given the constantly changing threat environment truly. Compounding the problem is the singular nature of most security tool interfaces (too many screens) and the lack of cross-communication within security teams.
Security teams need a solution that enables them to e ciently deal with security alerts and do so more e ectively through better communication, greater collaboration, and expanded knowledge of the threat landscape to get ahead of the situation. They need a tool that will allow them to more quickly collect, analyze, and respond to alerts in real-time, thus reducing the organization's overall cyber risk exposure.
Cyware Situational Awareness Platform (CSAP) is a real-time threat information sharing and communication platform that enables you to share accurate and actionable strategic threat intelligence systematically. CSAP automatically aggregates threat alerts and equips security teams with information to improve situational awareness and resilience. CSAP's unique mobile capability is the underpinning for a powerful "On-the-Go" availability of information and platform access that empowers security teams to take action in real-time or warn security teams of an immediate crisis.
CSAP is truly a cybersecurity force multiplier. Its strategic threat intelligence-driven approach ensures faster and better-informed responses. It drives collaboration between security teams, breaks down communication silos and improves overall security team e ciency and e ectiveness.
