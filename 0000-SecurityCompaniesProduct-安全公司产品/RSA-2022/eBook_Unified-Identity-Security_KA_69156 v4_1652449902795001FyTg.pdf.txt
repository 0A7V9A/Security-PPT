Cybersecurity resilience in an era of identity sprawl
How unified identity security can help close critical exposure gaps and support Zero Trust initiatives
®

As a CISO, your concerns expressed to the board of directors about cybersecurity have been largely drowned out by macroeconomic challenges, pipeline complexity and a need to enable a drastic increase in remote access.

Now it's Saturday morning and your work mobile phone is buzzing in your home office.
Why is your director of IT security simultaneously texting and calling you?
"This isn't good news," you think.
It isn't.
There's been a cyberattack. The extent of it is unknown, but your director of IT security tells you that the team is assessing the situation.
Questions race through your head: · How did they get in? · Was an internal user part of the attack? · How much privileged information did they access? · How am I going to communicate this to the board of directors? · Will this help or hurt my proposed cybersecurity
budget for the next fiscal year? · Do I need to update my resume?
There's been a cyberattack.
The extent of it is unknown, but your director of IT security tells you that the
team is assessing the situation.

The risk of identity sprawl
Your organization has been victimized by its own identity sprawl. It's a security risk of insidious creation that incrementally takes shape behind the guise of productivity and innovation intended to help the organization to operate faster and more effectively.
It seemed like the right thing to do to support the business with resources that enhanced the execution of its daily tasks. The problem is that each new system, app or database that your users connect to has a unique credential-handling process and requirements. Some less stringent than others. Some less secure that others. Some better. Many worse. Often, there's no visibility into who has access and what they are doing with it.
Layer on top of those issues, the ongoing need to provide privileged remote access to your admins; manage an increasing number of external users connecting with an even greater number of devices, operating systems and browsers; and attempts to control a roiling expanse of accounts, IDs and passwords.
You've got identity sprawl.
What are you going to do to control it, manage it and balance productivity against security?
The following is a high-level, eight-step overview of identity sprawl. This ebook discusses the disappearance of the traditional security perimeter, acheiving cybersecurity resilience and the Zero Trust model. You will learn how to take a holistic approach and how a unified identity security platform can protect your organization -- and your reputation.

CHAPTER 1 CHAPTER 1:
Trends that drive identity sprawl
As described above, the IT landscape is evolving before our eyes, which is having significant implications on how organizations must protect themselves to ensure cybersecurity resilience. It's tough to keep up. Some examples of changes with which security professionals must quickly adapt include:
· The rapid disappearance of the traditional office and infrastructure · Dispersed organizations are here to stay ­ employees are
increasingly working from home and from remote locations · A reliance on contractors and external
partners to scale and expand value · The push to adopt new platforms and technologies to accommodate
remote access and non-traditional work environments · The rise of cloud-first computing and the distribution
of cloud services to different physical locations

· The constant desire to optimize for efficiency, accessibility and cost savings
· Increased IT complexity due to adapting to privacy regulations, such as, GDPR, HIPAA and CCPA) and datasharing processes that help to maintain privacy or security
· Automation Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is progressively being used to streamline formerly manual and time-consuming processes.
Each of these trends creates new opportunities for efficiency and increased cybersecurity resilience, but each can create new challenges as well. Why? A common thread among each is the explosion of identities. Simply put, more people (internal and external), robots, machines and devices need to access company assets. On top of that, user accounts proliferate as organizations support a multi-generational IT landscape. All of this contributes to perhaps the biggest cybersecurity challenge yet: Identity Sprawl.

CHAPTER 2 CHAPTER 1:
Why taming the sprawl matters
We all know that bad actors exploit cybersecurity gaps wherever the gaps exist and often at scale. This is playing out in real time with identity sprawl, as we've seen a massive increase in identity and credential theft attacks recently.
For example, Verizon's 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found 63 percent of all breaches involved credentials, and CensusWide found that nearly half of organizations surveyed were hit with privileged credential theft in the previous year.
You see the devastating impact of these identity-related gaps featured on the front page of news sites virtually every day. The SolarWinds hack, the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and an Exchange Server vulnerability are just a few examples of highly visible incidents. These breaches not only impacted the average person's safety, livelihood, and security, but also resulted in negative repercussions for the organizations.
What's more, the success of some attacks could have been easily thwarted. Cybersecurity Insiders noted in a recent report that almost half of all users have more privilege than they need to do their job. That's why you not only see enterprises prioritizing identity and privilege, but you even have governments calling out their relative importance. In a September 2021 draft memo, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) highlighted a set of deliverables due by the close of fiscal year 2024, including for government agencies to adopt multifactor authentication and to set up enterprise-wide identity management processes.
For organizations to close this cybersecurity exposure gap, they will need to tame identity sprawl -- or face fines, lawsuits, and lost customer confidence and revenue.

The rise of identity as the new perimeter
With identity-related challenges becoming more prevalent and impactful, it stands to reason that the importance of identity security is increasing. The traditional perimeter remains an important defense for a cyberattack, but in many ways, it was born for another era. This infrastructure-centric approach, which has been a cornerstone of cybersecurity strategies for many years, is based on the belief that it is possible to protect everything inside the enterprise. Naturally, the only way to achieve this lofty goal is to optimize your defense at the outer-most points where preventing compromise at all points might be possible. With the security perimeter rapidly becoming IT lore, relying on this approach is simply not practical and antiquated. Senior IT security executives now recognize that compromise is inevitable. And as such, a more pragmatic strategy is to take measures to keep bad actors out, but also to prevent exploitation once they get inside the network. With this identity-centric approach, forward-looking organizations are prioritizing what's most critical, and then taking steps to verify everything before ever granting access in the first place -- e.g., who is this user? what should they have access to? what are they doing with that authorization? and when should their rights change? In short, the traditional perimeter is eroding, and identity is emerging as the new edge.

Key roadblocks to cybersecurity resilience
While identity security is a key emerging trend, success in this endeavor isn't always straightforward. This is largely due to how identities are evolving. In the past, organizations were primarily concerned with internal employees who were hired to do a single job, who were office bound, and who accessed resources from a single point. Most identities were users.
Contrast that with today, and it's an entirely different dynamic. Not only do security professionals have to worry about internal employees, but they also need to consider identities of contractors, suppliers and partners. Instead of doing one job, employees tend to change roles frequently, they are not office bound and they access what they need often from multiple points. And security professionals need to consider not just users, but also applications and machines as well. Users now can have multiple identities across even more accounts, users can be machines and robots, human users can have multiple devices that connect with different versions or generations of applications and they can all be moving about hitting resources from different physical access points and systems.
Moreover, most organizations today manage access rights in silos. According to the Third Annual Global Password Security Report, the average large enterprise identities in 25 different systems. This broad and varied environment can prevent the IT security team from attaining complete visibility into user activities. It also prevents the team from applying analytics in an end-to-end fashion. These challenges ultimately cause gaps and inconsistencies, and they can become a barrier to verifying everything before granting user access, which is a critical part of to implementing a modern security approach.
A failure to bridge these gaps could prevent your organization from adapting to changes in user roles/responsibilities, changes IT infrastructure, and to new and developing threats. Properly addressing the gap will contribute to your organization's cybersecurity resilience.

The case for a holistic approach to identity security
Identity security is flexible and can take very different forms depending on user populations and needs, and what resources are connected to and the make up an enterprise. The key to success is to shift from a fragmented to a unified identity-security state.
Many organizations address the key forms of identity security -- Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Identity Access Management (IAM), Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Active Directory Management and Security (ADMS) -- in a separate manner. Within each there are often multiple silos to consider and people, applications and data are all distinctly managed. This fragmented state creates a good deal of friction, prevents automation and forces organizations to make best guesses on when and how to manage access rights.

The emerging model is much more holistic with the key forms of identity security addressed together. This means that applications overlap, data silos are emancipated -- and people, applications and data are all aligned as one. This unified identity security approach you can correlate all identities, remove friction with better integration, reduce your attack surface, and strengthen your cybersecurity resilience.

CHAPTER 6 CHAPTER 1:
Unified identity security as a core building block for Zero Trust
By now, it's largely understood that Zero Trust is proven model for implementing robust and selective security. It eliminates vulnerable permissions, unnecessary and excessive access in favor of specificrights delegation and provisioning with granularity. Shifting from a fragmented to a unified state for identity security allows organizations to take a giant leap forward in delivering on this promise.
Zero Trust success starts with casting the net wide enough. This means focusing not just on people but also on machine identities and ever-expanding accounts as organizations move to a multigenerational, hybrid and edge, IT landscape. If you draw the circle too small, you stand to leave the side door open to bad actors. Unifying your identity security strategy helps ensure you avoid this issue.
A second key element of Zero Trust is delivering a continuum of rights across the organization. With added visibility and insights available, security professionals can more quickly and efficiently add, remove and adjust privilege just in time. In doing so, they can control user access to only what's needed for his or her job, and only at the right moment ­ while eliminating error-prone manual processes and heavy IT involvement.
Finally, a key element of Zero Trust is adaptability, which is enabled with a unified identity security strategy. By leveraging holistic approach that includes contextual awareness and behavior analytics, organizations can more quickly and efficiently anticipate, detect and take corrective actions that address emerging threats.

Best practices for unifying your approach to identity security
Technology can dramatically improve an organization's chances of success in unifying identity security, but what should security professionals look for in a solutions provider to optimize their outcomes? Below are five must-haves as you consider alternatives: 1. Holistic correlation: First and foremost, organizations will need
end-to-end unification of all identities and accounts to optimize visibility and to make optimally informed decisions. 2. Automated orchestration: A second core element of a unified identity security strategy is frictionless governance, across identity and privilege. This allows you to drive efficiencies at scale. 3. Robust analytics: Given the breadth and evolving nature of identity security, organizations need solutions that deliver the level of insights necessary to anticipate, detect and take corrective actions on emerging threats at scale. 4. Adaptive cybersecurity resilience: With a recognition that the threat landscape and the enterprise are no longer static, cybersecurity professionals should have the ability to quickly pivot as needed and future proof their investments. 5. Continuous verification: Unified identity security is most successful when you can verify everything before access is granted. Technology enriched with situational awareness, session monitoring, and behavior analytics will help deliver.
