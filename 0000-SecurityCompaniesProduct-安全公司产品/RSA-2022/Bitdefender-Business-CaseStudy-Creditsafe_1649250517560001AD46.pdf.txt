Creditsafe earns high scores for hybrid
cybersecurity
Protects highly sensitive financial information on endpoints and in data center

Case Study

THE CHALLENGE
Businesses want to verify that prospective partners are financially viable, with strong credit histories. Offering the industry's most predictive scoring algorithms, Creditsafe helps businesses make sound, informed decisions about engaging with other firms.
Creditsafe must ensure its information is secure from cyberattacks, while maintaining superior system performance for its employees and high virtualization density for optimal efficiency. The company's prior security solution offered IT limited visibility and reporting about outbreaks. Its scanning of servers and laptops would also slow system performance and reduce productivity of users.
To resolve these issues, Creditsafe conducted proofs of concept against a range of competitive solutions.
Dan Crofts, Senior Infrastructure Engineer, Creditsafe Group, explains why Bitdefender led the pack: "Bitdefender is the perfect package for us. Not only does Bitdefender have great antivirus and malware detection, but it barely consumes any CPU resources. It also integrates USB control, web filtering and laptop encryption--all at a cost-effective price point."
THE SOLUTION
Creditsafe has deployed the Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security Enterprise solution to protect more than 1,200 systems on various operating systems, including virtual machines. Creditsafe also depends on Bitdefender for full-disk encryption.
GravityZone Business Security Enterprise strengthens Creditsafe's protection against sophisticated attacks with effective endpoint detection and response. Geraint Treharne, Creditsafe's head of information security and compliance, explains: "Bitdefender EDR has helped us increase our resilience against cyber-attacks. EDR makes detection more accurate and provides a solid background on what's happening at the endpoint. This helps us decide how to respond--whether we block suspicious files or processes or isolate an endpoint."
The company's 1,500 employees use thin clients or desktops to access Bitdefender-protected Citrix resources via the cloud. IT uses the GravityZone cloud console to manage the entire environment.
Bitdefender's integration with Active Directory, automatic uninstall of McAfee, and control via relay servers all helped make the deployment quick and easy for the IT team.

Creditsafe is the world's most-used supplier of online company credit reports. With 200,000-plus subscription users and 16 offices in 12 countries, Creditsafe delivers accurate and up-to-date credit information on over 240 million businesses in an easy-to-use format for businesses of all sizes.

THE RESULTS
After overcoming initial issues in removing existing protection, which is an industry-wide challenge, Bitdefender has demonstrated its strong detection capabilities and increased infrastructure performance and efficiency. For example, Bitdefender completes full scans in a few minutes, compared to an hour previously. CPU utilization has also fallen, from 60 percent to barely registering on usage scales. This helps increase virtualization density for the infrastructure, along with the performance of the systems for end users.
"We're impressed with Bitdefender's minimal resource usage," says Crofts. "We simply don't notice it running, even on our most heavily used systems. Bitdefender completely wiped out bandwidth latency, and servers are more snappy and responsive. Our users are happier, and we gained breathing room to grow."
In addition, Creditsafe avoided increasing its Citrix server environment by 30 percent when it moved to Amazon Web Services.
Creditsafe also highly values the GravityZone Full-Disk Encryption because of the sensitive nature of financial and credit information and the risk of theft or loss of employees' laptops.
"Rolling out encryption can be a daunting task," says Crofts. "With a few clicks, we deployed encryption in just 30 minutes and users didn't even notice. The project was a massive win for us."
Since deploying Bitdefender, Crofts is happy to report no malware or infections infiltrated the infrastructure. Now, IT spends about half the time on security-related issues and administration.
"Bitdefender's reporting is miles ahead of our previous solution," Crofts said. "With Bitdefender, it's easy and clear to see everything across our data center on a granular level and then customize how we want systems to react and perform. When we make policy changes with Bitdefender, they carry through our estate in seconds when before we had to wait for 30 minutes."
Bitdefender's layered, multi-stage approach to security has been a major asset to Creditsafe, according to Crofts. "With machine learning, behavior analysis and detection at various stages, Bitdefender gives us a lot more confidence that threats will be picked up along the line before they inflict any damage. It's this layered approach that makes the product a real standout compared to competitors."
