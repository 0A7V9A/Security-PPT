2021 identities and security survey
Understanding the trend toward unified identity security as a countermeasure to identity sprawl

With the proliferation of human and machine identities, the race to the cloud, and the rise of remote working, the move to unified identity security and protecting user data has never been more important. In order to learn more about identity security challenges and associated emerging needs, One Identity commissioned a survey to poll top cybersecurity professionals around the globe.
The online survey was conducted in September 2021 and was completed by more than 1,000 respondents ­ with representation from all three major regions around the world and a spread of company size and verticals. Below is a summary of some of the key findings.

Organizations of all sizes are experiencing identity sprawl
· 25% say that the number of identities they manage has increased by a factor of 10 or more
· More than 8 in 10 people said that the number of identities they manage has more than doubled
· 95% report challenges in managing identities overall
Identity security is currently managed in a fragmented fashion
· 21% say they manage identities in 100 or more different systems
· Half manage access rights in 25 or more silos across the enterprise
· 51% said that multiple silos yield a lack of visibility regarding who has access to what system

Managing identity security in a fragmented fashion yields complexity and risk
· 55% say a wide range of applications and identity technologies complicate provisioning and deprovisioning
· Almost 9 in 10 say that employees have more privileged access than is necessary
· 12% are fully confident that they can prevent a credential-based attack
The ideal path forward is unified identity security
· Half say an end-to-end unification of identities and accounts is needed
· 47% are looking for automated orchestration across identities and privileged accounts
· 2/3 said they are looking for a unified identity security platform

85%
Report employees have more privileged access than needed
2/3
Say that a converged platform would be an optimal solution

Recommendations
Enhancing your cybersecurity posture means taming identity sprawl and shifting from a fragmented to a holistic approach to identity security. Key to accomplishing this is to unify your approach to managing access rights, to verify everything before granting access to your most-important assets, and to take pragmatic measures so you can adapt to an ever-evolving threat landscape.
