DATASHEET

Digital signing is in our DNA
As a globally recognized Certificate Authority (CA) and Trust Service Provider (TSP) with over two-and-a-half decades of experience, GlobalSign is uniquely equipped to provide document signing solutions that meet a variety of legislative guidelines and strict compliance measures. That's the GMO Sign advantage.
High-assurance digital signatures at your fingertips
While basic eSignatures are acceptable for many different document types, there is no easy way to prove the signer's identity and they are generally not considered legally binding. To help address these questions of authenticity and integrity, digital signatures were developed. When you apply a digital signature to a document, cryptography employed behind the scenes binds your digital certificate with the data being signed into one unique "fingerprint."
For today's remote and distributed workforces, the ability to apply secure digital signatures is critical, so they can keep business moving. GMO Sign not only has an intuitive interface but also provides a seamless, cloud-based solution for applying digital signatures across the enterprise. No more juggling tokens or managing complex HSM solutions. Since GMO Sign is powered by GlobalSign's Digital Signing Service (DSS) you get all of the benefits of trusted and compliant digital signatures without the hassle of managing digital certificates.
One platform, so many uses
Unlike many other document signing solutions on the market, GMO Sign offers both electronic and digital signatures in one interface, allowing you to customize signatures depending on internal and/or external use cases for the enterprise.
Users can easily add document details like renewal period, termination notice, and expiration date. Plus, the application contains eight custom fields that can be used to provide additional details related to the document so you can file away and search for documents as they're needed.
GMO Sign is available to purchase in packs for electronic signatures, digital signatures, or both.
How It Works:
For electronic signatures, the process can be facilitated 100% through the initiating company's instance of GMO Sign. Electronic signatures can be applied by employees within the organization, or partners/customers of the organization.
For secure digital signatures, both parties would require their own instance of the GMO Sign application. Digital signatures can be applied by employees within the organization or, if both companies are using the GMO Sign application, digital signatures can be applied by both parties.
