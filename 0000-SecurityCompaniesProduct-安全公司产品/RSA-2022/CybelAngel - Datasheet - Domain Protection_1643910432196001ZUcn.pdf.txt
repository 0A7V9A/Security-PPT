DOMAIN PROTECTION
Heavy on cybersquatters, light on your resources

DATASHEET

Quick, cheap, and lethal: there's no end to the enduring fame of cybersquatting as a go-to attack vector. In 2020, 20% of cyberattacks started with successful phishing attempts1. In the long run, domain spoofing strains cybersecurity teams as they must focus their attention on thousands of doppelgangers at once. Existing solutions fail to provide real-time exhaustivity and actionability, simultaneously.
That's why top organizations rely on CybelAngel to monitor, detect and take down malicious domains, both dormant and active, to keep their brand, business and customers secure.

We received an Incident Report confirming the presence of child abuse content on a lookalike domain. We blacklisted the domain in our firewalls, and escalate the issue to our legal team, with information from the report, including the registrar name and Whois information.
