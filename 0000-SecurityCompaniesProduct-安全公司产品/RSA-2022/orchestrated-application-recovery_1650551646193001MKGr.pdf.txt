Orchestrated Application Recovery

Ensuring security and resiliency for data and business services in the face of cyber attacks and other disaster events is a critical responsibility of modern digital enterprises. However, installing and maintaining new infrastructure and software for Disaster Recovery (DR) can be expensive and time consuming. Executing manual plans for applications with multiple tiers and interdependencies slows down the recovery process and introduces opportunities for error.
Enterprises can avoid these burdens by using Rubrik Orchestrated Application Recovery for a tightly integrated and automated DR service. Orchestrated recovery is delivered as a SaaS-based application. It provides orchestration of DR failover/failback, testing, and together with application-focused Ransomware Investigation will radically simplify recovery for business services running in VMware vSphere environments. As a result, IT organizations can eliminate multiple point solutions, management complexity, and avoid unnecessary costs.

FAST VM RECOVERY
Protect vSphere VMs across sites with just a few clicks for coordinated failover
and failback completed in minutes rather than hours.

FLEXIBILITY AND SAVINGS
Eliminate the cost of standalone, per-VM priced solutions. Licensed per Rubrik
cluster to enable DR protection for all of your applications.

SINGLE CONTROL PLANE
Combining SLA-driven backups with user-defined application Blueprints, enable easily coordinated DR and
ransomware recovery.

No installation required. DR orchestration is integrated into the SaaS-based Rubrik platform. Rubrik unifies management of your data protection policies (backup, archival, replication, and DR) to minimize data loss and downtime with a focus on management simplicity at scale.
Replication between sites, VMware Cloud on AWS or Azure VMware Solution serves as a prerequisite.

1. Define a Blueprint, which contains information on the application's VM recovery sequence and resource mapping configurations (compute, storage, and network). Blueprints provide management simplicity and orchestration focused at the application-level.
2. VM snapshots are ready-to-go, replicated to your DR site based on the assigned SLA policy.
3. Failover to your on-premises site, to VMware Cloud on AWS or Azure VMware Solution in just a few clicks. Achieve nearinstant RTOs with point-in-time copies of VMs pre-staged on vSphere Datastores and continuously updated in the DR site. Enable RPOs of about 60 seconds by leveraging CDP-enabled (continuous data protection) SLAs for the most demanding application recovery plans.
4. Failback to your on-premises data center while continuing your existing snapshot chains and CDP recovery points to maintain SLA compliance throughout the event. No new full-backups are required.

RECOVER FROM CYBER ATTACKS WITH INTEGRATED RANSOMWARE INVESTIGATION Integration with Ransomware Investigation intelligence identifies encrypted data and the most recent, clean state. Orchestrate DR with local recovery at the production site from uncompromised backups.
