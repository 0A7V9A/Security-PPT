Flexible Key and Policy Management for Stronger Encryption

Highly capable key and policy management, a foundation for strong encryption

Can be used with a wide range of third party solutions

Available as virtual machines or hardware appliances

Overview Encryption key management is one of the biggest challenges in data security. Keys must be managed over their full lifecycle and sophisticated policy management is needed to ensure strong data protection without impacting operations. Poor quality encryption keys can significantly weaken data protection. Finally, integrating with legacy devices can complicate or delay implementation and drive up costs.
Improving Key Management Strong encryption requires effective key and policy management to properly protect your data, keeping it safe even in the event of a breach. Many key managers are not interoperable with other devices or platforms, generate weak keys, or lack the proper policy control, resulting in siloed data protection, negative impacts on operations, and potentially weaker encryption.
QuintessenceLabs' Trusted Security Foundation® (TSF®) key and policy manager delivers secure, centralized, and highly interoperable key and policy management across any organization. As either a virtual machine or hardware appliance, the TSF key and policy manager can manage keys over their full life cycle, implement strong object and user policy management, and offers built-in replication -- up to 16 nodes for maximum availability.
QuintessenceLabs uses quantum technology to capture a level of randomness only seen in nature, resulting in perfectly unpredictable random numbers, encryption keys or other security objects, of much higher entropy than those generated by typical deterministic sources.
The TSF key and policy manager can integrate and manage this highspeed, high-entropy source of keys to enable the implementation of strong encryption.

TSF Integration The TSF key and policy manager products support:
· OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP): The TSF product range has been tested with many third party devices commonly in use. These include products from IBM, HP, Oracle and NetApp, enabling the TSF key and policy manager to be seamlessly integrated into legacy infrastructure with minimal disruption and delay
· NIST SP 800-57 key life cycle requirements: The TSF key and policy manager supports thousands of end-client systems, tens of millions of keys, and transaction rates of 8,000 key requests per minute per node
TSF Deployment The TSF key and policy manager products are offered in several configurations:
· From an efficient Hyper-V or VMware virtual machine (TSF 100) to dedicated key management appliances (TSF 200, TSF 300)
· A comprehensive appliance with both true random number generation and hardware security module
The TSF key and policy manager fits the needs of any organization looking to transform their key management.
