Unleashing the Power of 5G
Telecom service carriers are transitioning from legacy fixed-line, proprietary hardware to more versatile infrastructure utilizing advanced software technologies, such as SDN and NFV, to virtualize and offer more services over the cloud. The potential benefits include reduced CAPEX, flexible scalability, shorter development time and lower investment risk for functional upgrades. Since SDN and NFV are complementary and synergetic, the opportunity around the network software will be more dynamic than ever for the industry, and by 2020, it is expected that the emergence of 5G specifications will totally transform business service models for MSPs.
As more leading service providers are realizing the benefits of SDN and NFV to their business advantage, Lanner, the global supplier in networking platforms, has taken the mission to assist operators in the transition from traditional network infrastructures to today's agile and flexible architectures by supplying optimized and proven networking hardware for SDN and NFV deployments in telecommunication services.

Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)
MEC refers to the ability to perform critical core network functions, covering the compute, storage and analytics, at the network edge so that latency is substantially reduced when traffic can be routed to the edge first instead of to the cloud directly. Under this infrastructure, the orchestration aggregates the compute and storage resources, along with networking capability to run user applications at the edge, within proximity to where requests and traffics are generated.
Use case: Programmable Network Platform Empowers Scalable Firewall
Lanner collaborated with NoviFlow to deliver a scalable firewall solution. The integrated multivendor solution leverages modular hardware and software to provide 145 Gbps to 1 Tbps of scale-out Firewall service with unmatched remote configuration and monitoring, while delivering significant reductions in capital and operating costs, footprint and power consumption.

vRouter
The edge computing and intelligent gateway architecture require the capabilities to tremendous volume of traffic for real-time pre-processing, data analytics, policy control, communication and messaging to connect, collect and manage network programmability.
With the rollout of the CORD network infrastructure, the Virtual Router requires to Perform L3 unicast routing to and from the Central Office and participate in dynamic routing protocols, multicast signaling and forwarding, apply Quality of Service (QoS) policies and support and apply NAT functionalities.

vBNG / vCGNAT
Rapidly increasing subscriber IP traffic is putting pressure on telecom operators and service providers to upgrade their network and keep up with demand. There is a growing shift within operators to disaggregate certain legacy hardware infrastructure in favor of a more agile software defined architecture. One typical scenario would be replacing a fat central edge router (running BNG) with next gen distributed access devices utilizing NFV to optimize their last mile networks. This includes deploying software based vBNG that will be sited closer to the access devices.
Lanner hardware platforms have been successfully tested and deployed as a vBNG delivering significant performance improvements, shorter service delivery timescales and a scalable future-proof solution. Our extensive range of hardware platforms designed for NFV applications are aimed at delivering lower TCO and maximum flexibility for our partners and customers.

5G Open RAN
OpenRAN is anticipated as the next revolution for Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure, and considered as an optimal solution to enhance capacity and coverage, while reducing latency caused by escalating growth of data on the 5G network. OpenRAN solutions offer flexibility and scalability through the disaggregation of hardware and software, and the utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware.
The rapid growth of Open RAN has enabled numerous innovations in the space of wireless connectivity, driving service and supply chain diversity as the disaggregation of radio access networks facilitates the implementation of open interfaces. With pre-validated Open RAN solutions, Lanner and ecosystem partners are dedicated to accelerating Open RAN deployments to reach the economies of scale.
