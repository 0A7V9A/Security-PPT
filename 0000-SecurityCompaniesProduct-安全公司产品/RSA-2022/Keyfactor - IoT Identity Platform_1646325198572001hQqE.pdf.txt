Design and Build Secure IoT Devices at Scale.
Keyfactor Control enables manufacturers to design, deliver and maintain the most trusted connected devices on the market.

DATASHEET

Secure any device, anywhere
Tight budgets, hardware constraints and complex IoT supply chains make it hard to build strong security into devices at scale. But when safety and security are at stake ­ it has to happen. With Keyfactor Control, device manufacturers can easily and cost-effectively embed identity into their connected devices at any scale.

Ensure device safety, security, and privacy
Securely design, provision, and update connected devices to prevent warranty recalls and protect against threats.

Comply with cybersecurity requirements
Implement identity by design to comply with regulatory standards and cybersecurity mandates.

Reduce costs and deliver products faster
Reduce the cost, effort, and complexity of implementing security with end-to-end IoT identity lifecycle automation.

Key Features
Provision unique identities for millions of devices
Embed keys and certificates into devices at any stage in the manufacturing process -- from initial device provisioning to enrollment in the field. Use a flexible C or Java agent to enable on-device key generation (ODKG), encryption, and signature verification.

HOW IT WORKS
Identify
Embed unique identity and authentication into each and every device.
Protect
Protect data-at-rest and in-transit between devices, apps, and cloud platforms.

Verify
Ensure device integrity with secure boot, firmware signing, and verification.

Secure firmware signing and over-the-air updates
Protect against malicious updates by ensuring that only trusted and authorized code runs on your devices. Secure the firmware signing and delivery process with policy-driven workflows, centralized signing tools, and built-in HSM key protection.

Control
Issue and manage keys, certificates, and trust stores across your device fleet.

Assure device integrity with secure boot and encryption
Verify device identity and firmware by integrating with trusted platform modules (TPM), secure elements and embedded cryptographic engines. Implement encrypted TLS or IP VPN communications and encryption of data-at-rest.

"We recently had to do a bulk revocation for an end-of-life product line that covered hundreds of thousands of certificates. Previously, it would've taken an admin a year to do it manually, but with Keyfactor, we revoked everything within 10 minutes."

Automate PKI and the IoT identity lifecycle
Rapidly issue, provision, renew, and revoke certificates and keys throughout the device lifecycle from one platform. Integrate with your on-premise PKI or leverage a fully managed, dedicated, and high-assurance PKI from Keyfactor.

"At this processing rate, it was estimated that the replacement for a typical two tier PKI (two chain certificates plus the end entity certificate) would operate at two million vehicles per-hour"
