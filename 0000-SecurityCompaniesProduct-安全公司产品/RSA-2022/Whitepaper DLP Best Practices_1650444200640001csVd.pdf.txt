Data Loss Prevention Best Practices
Whitepaper
Protecting your entire network

Objective

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools have become an essential part of data protection strategies. Highly flexible and adaptable to any company size, DLP solutions can be tailored to different needs and support compliance efforts with new data protection regulations. This whitepaper outlines the best practices companies should adopt when implementing DLP tools.

Background & Importance of Data Loss Prevention

There are few companies nowadays that do not keep digital records. Everything from accounting to marketing and basic communication happens on a computer and over the internet. This also means that every company, no matter its size, collects digital data including sensitive categories such as personal information regarding employees, customers, or partners that are protected by law.
With a growing number of security breaches and different cybercrimes, with data being mined, monetized, and resold, not only are customers getting more irritated and upset, but these incidents are also causing reputational, financial, and legal damages to companies that mishandle sensitive data.
Therefore in today's world, data security is a vital factor and a major challenge for every organization, underlined by stricter regulations and severe consequences in the case of data loss.
Data Loss Prevention solutions have become a core component of a company's cybersecurity strategy as they help to ensure that sensitive or critical business information does not get outside the corporate network or to a user without access. With DLP software, companies can defend against data theft, loss, and exfiltration as well as make a difference in the process of data protection. By implementing one, it becomes possible to better identify, manage, and protect valuable business information and assets.

A DLP solution comes with several benefits and helps companies to:

Mitigate insider threats Safeguard customer data

Protect Intellectual Property (IP) Ensure regulatory compliance

Best Practices to Ensure Data Security
DLP solutions have become an essential part of data protection strategies. Highly flexible and adaptable to any company size, they can be tailored to different needs and support compliance efforts with new data protection regulations such as the GDPR or the CCPA.
We have compiled a list of best practices that will help companies in the DLP selection process and will ensure an efficient data protection strategy.

Identify and monitor sensitive data
Enterprises must identify the type of sensitive data they collect, where it is being stored, and how it is being used by employees. DLP tools come with predefined profiles for sensitive data while also allowing companies to define new profiles based on their own needs. By turning on data monitoring, companies can find out how data flows within and outside their network. It can help them discover vulnerabilities in data handling and bad security practices among their employees.

Implement a cross-platform DLP solution
macOS and Linux are slowly catching up with Windows and organizations should not ignore them when choosing their DLP tools. Cross-platform DLP solutions like Endpoint Protector offer feature parity between Windows, macOS, and Linux which means that sensitive data will have the same level of protection regardless of the operating system a computer is running on. It also allows for all endpoints on the company network to be controlled from the same dashboard.

Set up policies and test them
To control the sensitive data they identify, DLP tools offer companies a wide array of pre-configured-rules and policies that can be enforced across the company network. These can block sensitive data from being transferred via potentially unsecure channels such as messaging apps, file sharing, and cloud services. It can also limit who sensitive data is sent to by email. When it comes to data at rest, DLP solutions allow companies to delete or encrypt sensitive data when it is found on unauthorized computers.

Control what can connect to a company endpoint
Data can be lost not only via the internet but also through the use of removable devices. Companies can use DLP solutions to block USB and peripheral ports on devices or allow only whitelisted devices to connect to them. Enforced encryption can also be a way to ensure that, if a USB is being used, all files transferred to it are automatically encrypted and thus inaccessible to anyone without a password.

Set different levels of authorization
Access to sensitive data and its use should be limited depending on an employee's duties and the group they belong to. DLP tools allow admins to set up different levels of authorization for users across a company network based on individual users, devices, groups, or departments. In this way, companies can ensure that employees who do not normally work with sensitive data have limited or no access to it while not hindering the work of individuals who deal with it on a day to day basis.

Set up a remote work policy for DLP

Educate employees on DLP and data security

Many organizations invest heavily in the security of company networks which, once a computer is taken home, can leave the sensitive data stored on it vulnerable to breaches. It is important to set up a remote work policy that includes DLP tools that will work outside the company network and whether a device is online or offline. In this way, they can ensure that data is continually protected, no matter where a company computer travels to.

It's critical that employees understand the need for DLP tools, the best security practices, and the consequences of a data breach. Enterprises can use the results of DLP data monitoring to raise awareness over bad practices and help employees correct them. An understanding of the importance of DLP can also prevent employees from attempting to circumvent policies and instead report any problems they may be experiencing to admins who can then tweak DLP policies for higher overall efficiency.
