Introduction
Perhaps the greatest challenge in the whole of cybersecurity operations is the informational asymmetry that's inherent to the field. After all, organizations ­ regardless of whether they're publicly-held companies, privately-owned corporations or partnerships, government agencies, or non-profits ­ exist in the public realm. They're registered entities, and information about their structure, makeup, and purpose is readily discoverable. Adversaries can conduct in-depth research about their targets while relying only on sources that are available to the general public.
Attackers, on the other hand, exist within a shadowy underworld realm that's clandestine, difficult to break into (or even learn about), and fluid.
This means that attackers will always know more about their targets than defenders know about their adversaries. What's more, no one can ever be confident that they understand the size and scope of the threat that cybercrime and cyber-espionage pose, though this threat seems to have grown significantly over the last 18 months to two years.

INTRODUCTION
Cybercriminal activity tends to trend up every year, but it escalated in unprecedented ways as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe in 2020. Research conducted by the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) and the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) reveals that defenders confronted a 63% increase in overall attack volumes in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic's outbreak.1 2020 also saw a dramatic increase in ransomware attack volumes, and ransomware was responsible for a full 10% of the data breaches examined in Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report, a rate that's more than twice the previous year's.2 In total, ransomware victims paid out approximately $350 million worth of cryptocurrency that year, a 311% increase from 2019.3 Nation-state attackers became more brazen during the same period, with research indicating that `significant' nation-state attacks increased by 100% from 2017 to 2020, with attacks becoming more frequent and attack techniques more varied.4
According to David Shearer, CEO of the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2, today's defenders are simply "outnumbered ­ the people that are doing bad things, whether it's nation-state type activity or cybercrime ­ the good guys and girls were vastly outnumbered even prior to the pandemic. [The pandemic] had a compounding effect on what was already a challenge... take all of this technology we are becoming more reliant on and [this challenge] is scaling at a massive pace."5
Approximately 2.8 million professionals currently work in the cybersecurity field worldwide, but an estimated 3.1 million roles would need to be filled to meet demand

3.1 million roles
would need to be filled to meet the current demand
completely, close the skills gap, and adequately protect organizations.6 Still, these numbers are only estimates. And there's simply no way of telling how many individuals participate in cybercriminal activities or are involved in cybercriminal networks. We can be confident that attackers and defenders aren't evenly matched, but we can't be sure how great the imbalance is.
It's clear, however, that the demands on today's security operations (SecOps/SOC) teams are greater than ever. Nearly one-third of the security and IT professionals surveyed by ISSA/ESG (above) reported that their workload had increased in the past year. Nearly 25% said that their on-the-job stress levels had risen as well.
Threat intelligence and operational information-sharing can help right the balance of power between attackers and defenders.
In the face of challenges that cybersecurity teams currently confront, it's more important than ever that they're able to use all of their resources ­ including knowledge, creativity, and analytics skills ­ as effectively as possible. There's an enormous need for solutions that will enable them to maximize their human potential.
When it's properly applied and integrated within an enterprise-grade security program, that's exactly what threat intelligence does.

How Threat Intelligence Acts as a Force Multiplier for Highly Effective Security Teams

On average, an enterprise SecOps team investigates only 48% of the alerts that it receives. Among these, only 26% are found to have any value or legitimacy whatsoever.7
On average, an enterprise SecOps team
investigates only 48%
of the alerts that it receives
Threat intelligence gives security teams a mechanism for assessing whether alerts or events are meaningful within the context of broader situational awareness. This enables analysts to train their attention on the greatest real-world risks that their organization faces at any particular time.

Providing access to aggregated threat data from government agencies, private enterprises, and independent security researchers ­ all consolidated into a single centralized threat library ­ high-quality threat intelligence acts as a lens to better understand the outside world.
Threat intelligence allows security teams to act more quickly and purposefully, by informing them how adversaries act and what tools they tend to use. This enables analysts and responders to better understand where to look during all phases of an investigation.

To be most effective, threat intelligence must be actionable.
This means that it can be used as a basis for tactical and strategic decision-making. If threat intelligence is to be actionable, it must be accurate, aligned with your organization's individual requirements, predictive, and relevant.
Actionable threat intelligence should also be delivered through tools and solutions that work together. Seamlessly integrating this intelligence into operational and strategic workflows helps decrease security teams' stress and workload and reduce risk managers' uncertainties.

What Is Threat Intelligence? Why Does It Matter?
Threat intelligence is the collection, investigation, and analysis of data about an adversary's capabilities, infrastructure, motives, goals, and resources. This information gives security teams a holistic picture of the threats they face ­ one that can be applied within the operational and strategic defense of computing resources. This knowledge better enables an organization to detect, understand, and prevent attacks.

A threat intelligence platform (TIP) is a centralized solution that consolidates information from multiple threat intelligence sources and indicator feeds into a single place where it is filtered, screened, and processed.
This makes it usable and actionable. Humans can rely on it as a knowledge source to draw upon when analyzing and responding to incidents, and automated tools can act upon the real-time data it provides.A TIP transforms what would otherwise be decontextualized data into highly relevant insights. The TIP thus gives security teams a holistic view of threats, adversaries, and tradecraft in their current state. And it lets them understand how the cyberthreat landscape is evolving ­ in real-time.
Incorporating a TIP into your security operations program can improve your detection, prevention, and response capabilities. To do so successfully, the TIP must provide actionable intelligence that can guide proactive threat hunting, alert triage, and incident response activities. It can also help teams prioritize where to invest their efforts and can guide business decision-makers in evaluating risk.

Threat intelligence is derived from two types of sources:
Internal sources: These are sources retrieved from your own network and computing environment. Internal sources include log files, alert histories, incident response reports, and network and security tool telemetries. Many security teams leverage a Security Information Event Management (SIEM) solution as their primary repository of internal threat data. Adding details from past incident response processes ­ such as which systems were impacted, which vulnerabilities were exploited, and which malware was employed ­ can increase the maturity of your internal threat awareness program. Internal systems often reveal the threats that are most relevant to your organization on an individual basis.
External sources: There are a wide variety of external threat intelligence sources to choose from. These include open-source and commercial threat intel feeds as well as blogs written by security researchers and vendors and publicly available reputation and block lists. Besides threat intel feeds, private or commercial sources of threat intelligence can include structured data reports, unstructured reports, and informal sources (such as an email message from an industry expert). Often, the challenge with this wealth of data is to determine its relevance as well as to refine it with context to ensure that it's actionable within your organization's unique threat landscape.

Not all threat intelligence sources are of equal value.
After all, detailed data about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by an adversarial group that's no longer active aren't terribly useful. Nor is information about exploits targeting a vulnerability in software that's not deployed anywhere in your environment.
In order to evaluate a particular threat intelligence source, you'll need to consider its merit within each of the following categories:
 Relevance: How well does this source help you understand the threats that are most relevant to your individual organization? In order to understand the relevance of data about active threats, you first need to understand whether the information is pertinent to assets that are actually present in your computing ecosystem. Then, you'll need to map your business processes to specific geographical, political, and industry-focused threat types. This will help you understand which are most likely to target you. In actuality, determining a threat intelligence source's relevance is an iterative process. The more you learn about the unique and specific risks that your organization faces, the better you can understand which intelligence is most relevant to your threat profile.
 Timeliness: How frequently and rapidly is the feed or source updated? And how does this frequency compare to the frequency of changes in the threat landscape? Some types of threat intelligence are more subject to change than others; this is largely dependent upon adversaries' skills and resources. If a threat intelligence source provides a way to detect adversarial activity that persists despite the evolution of those adversaries' capabilities and infrastructure, that intelligence won't need to be updated as frequently. In general, though, feeds and sources that evolve rapidly to reflect changing adversarial capabilities are best.
 Accuracy: How often does this source create or contribute to the creation of false-positive alerts? How well does it reflect the true state of adversarial capabilities today? And how well does this intelligence help analysts and incident responders understand the critical context surrounding their decisions? Accuracy is reflected not only in confidence ratings or certainty scores, which are evidence of the source's fidelity to the real world, but also in the information's usefulness for helping members of your team figure out which steps to take next when they confront an alert. Accurate threat intelligence enables incident responders to direct their efforts where they'll matter most, and can help both cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and security operations center (SOC) analysts to understand the motives and capabilities of their adversaries.

Threat intelligence can be gathered to serve two primary functions:
Operational: Threat intelligence with operational functionality is used to increase detection capability as well as to help teams identify the vulnerabilities within organizational assets that are most likely to be exploited. Sources of operational threat intelligence typically include vendor feeds, open-source intel feeds, and tactical reports that give details on adversaries' techniques, capabilities, and infrastructures.
Strategic: Strategic threat intelligence can help business, technology, and security leaders understand the size and scope of current and future financial, reputational, and operational risks that the organization faces. This is information about the extent of the exposure the organization has to particular threats as well as the status of its assets and revenue streams. Strategic threat intelligence can be gathered through threat assessments, critical business process mapping, and comprehensive risk analysis.
 Variety: How broad is the array of host- and network-based indicators or signatures that this source leverages? Across how many phases of an intrusion or attack lifecycle is the information relevant? The more indicators or detection techniques employed, the better.
The more relevant, timely, accurate, and varied the threat intelligence source is, the better it will be able to fulfill its primary purpose ­ to empower security teams to take the right action at the right time. When a TIP incorporates additional insights into how specific feeds are performing, analysts have a better basis for making decisions about which feeds to enable for their individual environment. For instance, ThreatConnect TIP includes Intel Report Cards, which enable analysts to tell at a glance how much credibility to give a particular Indicator of Compromise (IoC), based on what's known about its source.

A Job Well Done: The Purpose of an Effective TIP
To be able to advance the effectiveness of an organization's SecOps program (and its cybersecurity maturity overall), a TIP must have three primary sets of capabilities.

Aggregation
The TIP should be able to consolidate data from a diverse variety of sources including SIEM platforms, packet capture tools, incident response reports, and multiple external threat intel feeds into a central repository, which can serve as a single source of truth for anyone who needs access to this information. This enables security analysts to pivot (place information in context by relating it to other threat activities and external intelligence) during an investigation.

Analysis
The TIP should help security teams ­ from analysts all the way to the CISO ­ to understand which threats are most relevant to their specific role, as well as which pose the greatest risk to the business. Analysis can be manual but should be automated whenever possible because this generates faster scalable results. High-quality analysis is a critical step that must be undertaken before security teams can act upon threat intelligence.

Action
The TIP should be integrated with detection and defense technologies so that it can be seamlessly incorporated into monitoring and incident response workflows. This dissemination of information is what enables the security program to derive value from the insights it produces.

When it's integrated into all aspects of security operations and incident management, threat intelligence enables security professionals to focus on what matters most.
This increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the security team overall, and thus enhances the organization's overall security.

II. Leveraging Threat Intelligence in Security Operations:
The Power of Integrations
It's no secret that being overwhelmed is par for the course inside the modern SOC. And the events of 2020 and 2021 have amplified the stressors and challenges that SecOps professionals confront. In one recent survey, 70% of security professionals said that their home lives were negatively impacted by the threat and alert volumes they faced at work. 54% described themselves as "drowning in alerts" and 55% said that they were simply unable to prioritize and respond to threats at work.8
When leveraged to help security teams work smarter not harder, a TIP has the power to dramatically improve security teams' on-the-job performance, professional satisfaction, and sense of accomplishment. It can do so by enabling them to direct their efforts where they'll make the biggest difference. To achieve this aim, the TIP must be integrated within workflows spanning the entirety of the incident lifecycle.

Security Monitoring and Alert Triage
High false-positive alert volumes remain one of the greatest challenges that security analysts tasked with monitoring and triage face in day-to-day SOC operations. When threat intelligence is used to provide contextual enrichment of alerts and events, it enables analysts to "connect the dots" with greater confidence. If a SIEM solution is ingesting invalidated, raw threat feeds, it's likely that the result will be an excess of noise ­ along with unnecessary triage and overwhelmed unproductive security teams. With a TIP, the threat data the SIEM receives has been aggregated and rationalized. This transforms noise into a clear signal that improves alerting accuracy and makes it easier for analysts to spot trends or patterns that are out of the ordinary.
Phishing Attack Triage
Phishing is an old and well-established cyber threat that still tops the list of the most popular initial attack vectors. And phishing activity reached new heights during the pandemic. According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, January 2021 saw the highest-ever monthly total of phishing attempts in the group's reporting history. Then the record was broken again in July 2021, with an unprecedented 260,642 phishing attacks.9
Having accurate phishing threat intelligence on hand makes it possible for security teams to quarantine known phishing emails before they ever reach employees' inboxes. When this intelligence comes in a form that's readily integrated with email security solutions and other network protection products, security teams can act with speed and confidence, or automate response actions to known phishing threats. Furthermore, should a phishing attack be successful, a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution that's integrated with the TIP (like ThreatConnect SOAR) will provide a workflow that enables rapid and successful triage of the incident.

Business Email Compromise (BEC) Prevention
A subset of phishing attempts, BEC attacks have become more prevalent over the past year. One recent study found that 71% of organizations had experienced a BEC attack between 2020 and 2021, with the majority of these attacks leveraging spoofed identities, look-alike domains, or compromised account credentials.10 Such attacks are notoriously difficult to detect, especially at scale. SecOps teams often need to review emails manually to identify fraudulent communications. With accurate, current threat intelligence, they'll know exactly where to look, saving time and effort while improving detection accuracy.
Incident Response and Threat Hunting
Having accurate information about the capabilities of threat actors enables security teams to understand their strategies as well as their TTPs. Responders can use threat intelligence to accelerate investigations since this information provides essential context and direction that can help them piece together cause and effect, and understand the relationships within event chains. Threat hunters often begin hypothesis-based hunts with a particular piece of threat intelligence in mind, searching for evidence that current threat actors have been present in the environment.

ThreatConnect TIP At-a-Glance
The ThreatConnect Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) centralizes the aggregation and management of all the threat data that's relevant to your security program within a single platform. This makes it possible for CTI and SOC analysts, incident responders, threat hunters, and business decisionmakers alike to have a clear view of the current threat landscape ­ one that can provide a basis of evidence for human decisions or be used to drive automated response actions.
To protect valuable cyber assets against today's sophisticated and wellresourced adversaries, defenders need to know who, how, why, and when those adversaries are most likely to attack. The TIP handles massive amounts of information from diverse sources. It's able to normalize data, enrich it with additional context, and automate manual threat intelligence-related security processes. This facilitates rapid response and gives all stakeholders a panoramic view of the current threat landscape.

Better Together:
Intel-Driven Security Platform (SOAR + TIP) Closes the Gap Between Knowledge and Action
There's a dramatic difference between security tools and solutions that simply ingest threat intelligence and those that are smart and flexible enough to make it actionable. This refined intelligence enables analysts and incident responders to automate routine actions or make better decisions during event triage, investigation, and remediation.

A security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solution should fall into the second category.

Automation means creating standardized, repeatable, machine-executed processes to handle tasks (such as querying logs, creating a ticket, or running a vulnerability scan) that would otherwise be performed manually. Orchestration involves bringing together disparate tasks within a coordinated response workflow, usually incorporating conditional logic to manage decision points. SOAR platforms were built specifically to automate and orchestrate rote activities within security operations workflows, and thus to reduce security teams' workload so that they can focus their efforts on higher-value tasks. SOAR makes it possible to block threats quickly while easing containment and accelerating response.
When properly integrated with other solutions and tooling in the SOC, the SOAR platform becomes the single, centralized hub that's home to all the processes and workflows, insights and intelligence, and reporting capabilities that SecOps teams need to collaborate successfully. Most security programs have dozens if not hundreds of tools in use, each of which creates logs and generates alerts. This means that over time it becomes increasingly challenging for analysts to figure out what's most worthy of their attention. SOAR was designed to solve this problem by providing a single place to turn for decision support, understanding associations across intelligence and use cases, and automatic triggering of response actions.

To achieve this aim, however, SOAR must be integrated with the rest of the organization's cybersecurity ecosystem. In particular, when TIP and SOAR are fully integrated, intelligence about adversarial capabilities, attack patterns, and strategies can be built into the logic that determines how orchestration operates to defend the environment. This means that situational awareness and historical context will determine which automated actions are taken. And, incorporating intelligence allows the process to be self-improving and adaptive.
When threat intelligence is applied to inform and drive orchestrated action, data on the resulting outcomes can be gathered and used to enhance the threat intelligence. This creates a feedback loop that can enhance the security team's understanding of what's effective, enabling ongoing and continuous improvement.

How an Intel-Driven Security Platform (SOAR + TIP) Bolsters Security Operations
As analyst firm Gartner recently noted, "Modern security tools can ingest and leverage threat intelligence. However, they often don't include guidance on the best way to leverage it."11
ThreatConnect has long been known as a leader in the TIP market. We added SOAR to our platform in 2019 with the specific goal of helping SecOps teams better incorporate threat intelligence into real-world SOC workflows. On the basis of our extensive experience integrating security technologies to create an intelligence-driven security platform that can unify the entire security team's activities, here are the four most important ways SOAR can help you leverage threat intelligence.
 Linking cases and intelligence: When SOAR and TIP are integrated, every event is enriched with invaluable contextual information. This makes it easy for analysts and incident responders alike to understand defined as well as probable associations.
 Enhancing detection and alert triage: Indicators of compromise (IoC) and detection signatures from the TIP can be leveraged to enhance detection capabilities across the whole of your cybersecurity solution ecosystem. The TIP can inform and enrich alerts generated by SIEM platforms

Modern security tools can ingest and leverage threat intelligence. However, they often don't include
guidance on the best way to leverage it.
along with network detection and response (NDR), endpoint detection and response (EDR), and extended detection and response (XDR) tools to enhance the entire ecosystem's accuracy and intelligence. This will reduce false-positive rates and speed time-to-action by providing insights and relevant context.  Adding actionable artifact context: ThreatConnect's IntelDriven Security Platform (SOAR + TIP) includes a dashboard view that makes it easy to correlate context with artifacts and events so that analysts have a deeper understanding of the relationships between potentially malicious activities.  Making threat intelligence available everywhere: With the ThreatConnect Browser Extension, analysts can instantly scan and identify relevant pieces of information from any web-based resource or web-based security tool. This makes it possible to quickly understand what you currently know about an indicator and add it to your threat library to aid in future analysis and investigation efforts.

Risk-led Intelligence Comes Together with Intelligence-informed Risk:
TIP + Cyber Risk Quantification Enables Faster, Better Decisions
In the past, many organizations relied solely on qualitative assessments of cyber risk. Often little more than educated guesses, these are imprecise estimates that can't adequately convey the full extent of the potential harm or financial damage that could result from a successful cyberattack. And such measures tended to be entirely divorced from the essential real-world context that high-quality threat intelligence provides. Today, automated cyber risk quantification (CRQ) is changing the game in quantitative risk assessment and business decision support.

What is Cyber Risk Quantification (CRQ)?
Cyber risk quantification involves using customer evidence, industry intelligence, and scientific methods ­ including mathematical modeling ­ to empower business and cybersecurity leaders to make better decisions by quantifying cyber risk into financial impacts. Long a standard practice in the insurance industry, banking, and the financial sector, the quantitative modeling of potential losses from adverse cyber events enables business leaders to integrate cybersecurity risks into cross-organizational risk portfolios, and make standardized comparisons and evidence-based decisions.
CRQ applies the risk and financial models that are most relevant to the business, its technical environment, and industry-specific situation so that strategic and technical or operational decisions can be brought into alignment. This way, the entire business is aligned around the threats that matter most based on primary and secondary loss magnitude. This makes it easier to figure out where to invest, where to focus operational efforts, and even what types of cyber insurance to consider. It also makes it easier for CISOs to communicate with business stakeholders using monetary value to describe risk. And it can give leadership teams full confidence that risk management decisions are being made on the basis of accurate situational awareness.

18
CRQ + TIP: A Mutually Beneficial Combination
Leveraging both threat intelligence and CRQ helps teams solve issues of prioritization by providing actionable recommendations to security leaders and practitioners ­ recommendations that are based on current, real-world threats. In particular, a solution like ThreatConnect RQ enables teams to choose which Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to patch first according to the potential financial impact of their exploitation.  For threat intelligence teams, cyber risk
quantification creates unambiguous, clearlydefined priorities. This ensures that people are focusing their efforts where they'll have the greatest impact.  A CRQ solution can guide business decisionmaking in the only way that's truly effective: incorporating real-world conditions into the evidence upon which it bases its assessment of financial risks.
ThreatConnect RQ is the only cyber risk quantification product on the market today that's able to automate the financial computation of an organization's cyber risk according to the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) standard. The FAIR standard is a practical methodology for measuring and analyzing cyber risks. It has been adopted by 45% of the Fortune 1,000 and 80% of the Fortune 10.

Conclusion:
Work Smarter, Not Harder in Security Operations
Today's cybersecurity professionals face a myriad of challenges, including tireless, resourceful, and endlessly innovative adversaries. But informational asymmetry no longer needs to be among the stumbling blocks that hold defenders back. A modern threat intelligence platform can help right the balance of power between attackers and defenders by showing SecOps teams exactly where to apply their efforts to yield maximum results.
Integrated into a comprehensive platform that includes SOAR and risk quantification capabilities to provide complete operational and decision support, a TIP can also serve as a single source of truth that enables security teams, IT leaders, and business decision-makers to better understand the threat and risk landscape that the organization must navigate.
Not only will a TIP enable technical professionals to see which threats matter most, but the best platforms will also help them communicate risks to business leaders so that the organization can make the wisest-possible investments. In this way, TIP helps SecOps teams maximize their efficiency and the value they deliver at the same time that it prepares the business to face tomorrow's threats.
