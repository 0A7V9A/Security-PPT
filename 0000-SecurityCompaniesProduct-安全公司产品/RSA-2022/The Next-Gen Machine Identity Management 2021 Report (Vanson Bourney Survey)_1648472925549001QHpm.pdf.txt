Introduction

In a time of rapid, exponential growth of IT networks, a robust approach to Machine Identity Management is key for organizations. Without the ability to effectively manage the identity of machines across their growing IT infrastructure, organizations risk opening themselves up to a wide range of consequences which could cripple their operations.
Yet, it is clear that there is room for improvement when it comes to organizations' approaches to Machine Identity Management, both in terms of the efficiency with which they are able to manage their solutions, and also the effectiveness of these solutions when it comes to keeping track of machine identities across their IT infrastructure. As it stands, many organizations are not fully aware of all of the certificates and keys across their digital assets, a state which leaves them exposed to risks including cybersecurity attacks, outages and financial losses.

However, there is light on the horizon, and organizations are starting to take the steps needed to overcome these issues. This whitepaper will investigate key trends when it comes to the next generation of Machine Identity Management ­ the types of solutions organizations are looking to implement, the benefits being experienced by those who are doing so, and the hurdles they will need to overcome.
In so doing, we will lay out a roadmap for organizations looking to improve their own Machine Identity Management, highlighting the key areas which should be the focus when improving Machine Identity Management processes, and the awareness that organizations have of certificates and keys. Armed with this knowledge, security teams can take the steps to ensure their Machine Identity Management solutions are robust, future ready, and enable sustainable growth of their IT infrastructure.

Looking to the future, organizations are taking steps to upgrade to the next generation of Machine Identity Management tools. The vast majority are planning to or currently implementing automated Machine Identity Management workflows (96%), the ability to manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid deployment models (95%), or Machine Identity Management-as-a-Service (95%) (95%)

The Challenge of Machine Identity Management:
Most Companies Lack Awareness of & Ability to Track Certificates and Keys
Survey Report 5

There are few technology trends more universal than that IT networks don't stand still. They are ever growing in size and complexity, adapting to the needs of organizations, facilitating growth and providing platforms and processes for the benefit of both employees and customers. But the growth of these networks is not without its challenges ­ security most prominent among them. As networks become ever larger and more elaborate, tracking who, or what, is on them inevitably becomes more difficult.

Indeed, organizations are facing a number of challenges in managing machine identities in their organization, with keeping track of certificates and keys across the various areas of their IT infrastructure currently proving far from easy. Close to three quarters currently face difficulties keeping track of these certificates and keys across each of the following: operational technology/IoT infrastructure (78%), cloud infrastructure (76%), on-premises IT infrastructure (75%) and containerized infrastructure (74%).

78%

76%

Keep track of certificates and keys across all areas of its operational technology (OT) /IoT infrastructure
75%

Keep track of certificates and keys in a cloud infrastructure
74%

Keep track of certificates and keys across all areas of its on-premises IT infrastructure

Keep track of certificates and keys in a containerized infrastructure

Figure 1: Showing respondents who find the following "Very difficult", "Somewhat difficult" or "A little difficult" [1,000]

Survey Report 6

These difficulties likely mean that organizations are not able to track certificates and keys as efficiently as they could be, or even that they aren't able to track some of them at all. As it stands, more than three-fifths (61%) of organizations do not hold full awareness of all certificates and keys across all of their digital assets, meaning that they aren't able to track the identities of all machines across their IT networks.
The potential ramifications of this lack of awareness are broad and widely felt. Almost all (96%) organizations which don't have full awareness of certificates and keys in their organization have experienced consequences as a result. Our research indicates that more than half (55%) have experienced a cybersecurity breach, while 52% say that new technologies implemented into their infrastructure have been left unprotected, and 47% have lost productive employee time as they have tracked unknown certificates and keys. Additionally, system outages (35%) and financial losses (33%) are also sizeable concerns for organizations.

Survey Report 7

Cybersecurity breaches are an issue of particular concern in smaller enterprises of 1,000-2,999 employees, of whom 59% have experienced a breach, compared to 48% of organizations of 5,000 or more employees. With operations, revenue and reputations at risk when cybersecurity breaches occur, it is imperative that organizations take proactive measures to improve awareness of the certificates and keys in their digital assets.
These consequences indicate that there is a clear need for organizations to ensure that their Machine Identity Management solutions are not only able to track certificates and keys across their current technologies, but also across new technologies implemented as their IT infrastructures grow. However, many Machine Identity Management solutions are still based on manual, legacy tools ill-suited to tracking identities across expanding IT infrastructures, with spreadsheets in use as part of these solutions in 93% of organizations. In fact, in 53% of organizations, spreadsheets are still a key part of the solutions, suggesting that organizations are struggling to move away from these types of tools. This reliance on legacy technology helps to explain why so many organizations find Machine Identity Management difficult, and struggle to cope with the resulting consequences.
Further, organizations' approaches to Machine Identity Management are likely also complicated by the fact that they are, on average, managing digital certificates from 5 Certificate Authorities (CAs).
It is evident Machine Identity Management poses a great problem to many, and the consequences of not being able to keep track of these identities across the IT infrastructure could be catastrophic. To address the risk they are currently facing, organizations need to urgently improve their approaches to Machine Identity Management.

Many Companies Face Machine Identity Management Challenges,
But How Are They Responding?
Survey Report 9

Positively, while many organizations are struggling to have full awareness of certificates and keys across their digital assets, there is strong belief that implementing the right solution would provide tangible benefits, and the vast majority (87%) agree that a robust certificate lifecycle management tool would eliminate outages in their organization. With outages potentially causing disruption to workflows, financial repercussions and damage to customer relationships, the case for improvements to be made is clear.
With the benefits of using the right Machine Identity Management solution being so clear, it is promising to note that many are indicating that they are committed to ensuring their solutions are up to task. The vast majority of respondents (90%) say Machine Identity Management is a top or high priority in their organization.

In addition, 92% agree that having the right Machine Identity Management solution would help their organization achieve crypto agility. With so many believing the right solution could provide benefits, the onus is on vendors to prove that they can provide the "right" solution.

93%

of organizations with 1000-2,999 employees are greatly prioritizing Machine Identity Management as compared to

89%

of organizations with 3000-4,999 employees and

87%

of organizations with more than 5000 employees.

The prioritization of Machine Identity Management seems to have caused organizations to take actions to improve their approaches to it. Nearly four in ten (38%) organizations are in the process of making improvements to their Machine Identity Management approach, and nearly two-thirds (62%) are planning to do so.

38% Yes, We are in the process of making improvements 62% Yes, We are planning to make improvements 01% No, we are not planning to make improvements

Survey Report 10

Looking at the differences between regions, organizations in North America are more likely to be making improvements to their current Machine Identity Management approach (41%) than those in Europe (35%). As a result, organizations in North America may pull ahead of their European competitors in their ability to manage machine identities across their IT networks. It is important to note that these improvements are planned or being made across the board, regardless of organization's current ability to manage machine identities. Those which hold full awareness of certificates and keys across their digital assets are more likely (53%) to be in the process of making improvements than those who do not (27%), suggesting that these improvements are paying off. However, organizations which do not yet have full awareness of their certificates and keys are not resting on their laurels ­ 72% of them plan to make improvements. The fact that they haven't yet suggests they may be struggling with how to best improve their approach, rather than resistance to spending money to fix the issues they face. With almost all organizations either making changes or planning to, we are arguably on the cusp of a new era when it comes to Machine Identity Management ­ organizations need to make sure they are making the right changes to move into this new era, and aren't left behind.
For organizations making these improvements, there are a range of factors driving them. Implementation of new devices and infrastructure such as IoT (41%) or containers and/or containerized applications (37%) are some of the most common reasons driving these improvements. This demonstrates that even amongst those who currently have full awareness over their certificates and keys, there is a constant need to make improvements in order to ensure IT infrastructures remain secure as they evolve.
11

Additionally, four in ten (40%) are making improvements in order to manage the increasing volume of certificates in their organization. A similar proportion (39%) state that they are making improvements in direct response to a problem they have experienced, such as outages and security breaches, as a result of current solutions being inadequate ­ further evidence that the problems organizations are facing due to current poor awareness of certificates and keys are spurring them into action to make improvements.

Survey Report 12

Among organizations of 1,000-2,999 employees, these improvements are most commonly being driven by a response to a problem the organizations have experienced, such as outages or security breaches (42%), further reinforcing the notion that organizations of this size are more vulnerable to these issues than larger ones. In contrast, this is only a driving factor in just over a third (34%) of organizations of 5,000 or more employees. Despite the focus on improvements, almost all (98%) organizations still face numerous challenges as they enhance their Machine Identity Management approach. Most commonly ranked in the top three challenges organizations face here are the complexity of ensuring that certificates are provisioned across all areas of their IT infrastructure (67%) and lack of skillsets within their IT/security team when it comes to Machine Identity Management (66%). This indicates a need for solutions which can be provisioned across the entire IT infrastructure, and can be easily implemented even where skillsets are lacking.
Lack of skillsets are a particular concern for smaller organizations of 1,000-2,999 employees, 70% of whom rank it in their three biggest challenges, compared to 65% of organizations with 3,000-4,999 employees, and 62% of those with 5,000 or more employees.

The Path Forward :
The Next Generation of Machine Identity Management Solutions
Survey Report 15

Understanding the steps organizations are taking to improve their Machine Identity Management requires knowledge of the features which will form key parts of the next generation of Machine Identity Management solutions. When looking at the features which organizations consider crucial to their solutions going forwards, there is a clear picture forming when it comes to what organizations expect the next generation of Machine Identity Management solutions will look like ­ 59% see the ability to run and manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid deployment models and 57% see automated Machine Identity Management workflows as essential to a next-generation solution. Other key areas are Machine Identity Management-as-a-Service (49%), the ability to manage certificate lifecycles for container-based applications (47%), smart discovery (39%), and service catalogues (38%). These are the areas organizations need to ensure their Machine Identity Management solutions include, if they are to achieve crypto agility and guarantee their solutions provide visibility across their entire IT infrastructure.

Hybrid Cloud Deployment ­ the ability to run and manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid deployment models
Automated workflows ­ automation of generation, renewal and management of certificates and keys for applications
MIMaaS (Machine Identity Management as a Service) ­ fully managed as a service offering
Containerized deployments ­ the ability to manage certificate lifecycles for container-based applications
Smart discovery ­ scanning cloud and on-prem devices
Service catalogues ­ the ability to offer relevant self service capabilities

Figure 6: Which of the following features do you believe are the essentials of a next-generation Machine Identity Management solution? [1,000]. Not showing all answer options
However, while recognition of the importance of these features is often high, only few have fully implemented each of these areas so far. The features which have been most commonly adopted, automated workflows and hybrid cloud deployment, have only been fully implemented by 33% and 32% of organizations, respectively. While most organizations either have started implementing each area, or have plans to do so, there is still a much work to do until they catch up with the market leaders.
Survey Report 16

Globally, research suggests some notable distinctions between regions. For example, organizations in North America are more likely to have started to, or fully implemented automated workflows (86%) and/or hybrid cloud deployment (87%) than those in Europe (78% and 76% respectively).
In the following three sections we will investigate the three areas most likely to be seen as essentials of Machine Identity Management solutions, and the benefits organizations can gain from implementing them successfully.

Essential area one: Automation
As previously noted, automation will be a key component of Machine Identity Management solutions going forward. 96% of organizations have either fully implemented, started implementing or have plans to implement automated workflows in the context of their Machine Identity Management workflows. However, progress has been slow, as only 33% have fully implemented these solutions so far.

33% We have fully implemented this

48% We have stared to implemented this

15%

We haven't started to implemented this, but have plans to

4% We have no plans to implement this

0%

0% Don't Know

Figure 7: To what extent has your organization implemented Automated Workflows in the context of its Machine Identity Management solution(s)? [1,000]

Survey Report 17

The evidence suggests that the move towards automated workflows is with good reason, as organizations which have fully implemented automated Machine Identity Management workflows are more likely (50%) to have full awareness of certificates and keys across all of their digital assets, than those who have only started this implementation (35%) or who haven't started yet but plan to (28%). Implementing automation of Machine Identity Management workflows should therefore be front of mind for organizations looking to be able to better track certificates and keys.
Automation of workflows wouldn't just improve organizations' ability to track certificates and keys; there is also a strong belief that it would reduce the cost and time of doing so ­ evidence of why it has become a key trend in Machine Identity Management.
IT security decision makers from North America are particularly likely to recognize the benefits of automation, with 95% believing it could help simplify and streamline Machine Identity Management workflows in their organization, compared to 88% of those in Europe.

94%
of IT security decision makers state that automation of Machine Identity Management workflows would reduce the costs, and
89%
state it would reduce the time spent managing certificates and keys. Further,
91%
state that it would simplify and streamline Machine Identity Management workflows in the organization.

Further, among organizations which have started to implement automation, almost all (99%) report at least one benefit as a result of doing so. These benefits include better awareness of certificates and keys across new and emerging technologies (54%), the ability to access certificates and keys more quickly (51%), stronger security credentials (51%) as well as the reduction in the chance of outages due to certificate expiry or human error (41%). With organizations experiencing this multitude of benefits the case is clear: automating Machine Identity Management should be a top priority for organizations looking to improve awareness of certificates and keys across their organization, as well as improve their Machine Identity Management processes.

Respondents from organizations which have started to implement automation in the context of their Machine Identity Management solutions. Not showing all answer options
However, it should not be ignored that the path to automation for many organizations will not be without its hurdles. With only 27% of IT security decision makers completely confident that their organization has the skillset to fully automate its Machine Identity Management workflows, organizations that are facing these issues should look for solutions and/or vendors which can help them to compensate for this skill shortage. Solutions which can be easily implemented, and reduce burden on the workforce are therefore more likely to be in high demand.
This is of particular concern in Europe, where only 24% of IT security decision makers are completely confident in this, compared to 31% in North America. This skills shortage may explain why organizations in North America are more likely to be implementing various aspects of next generation Machine Identity Management solutions than those in Europe.

Smaller organizations also face this issue to a greater extent, with only 22% from organizations of 1,000-2,999 employees reporting that they are completely confident, compared to 29% from organizations of 3,000-4,999 and 30% from organizations of 5,000 or more employees.
Survey Report 19

Essential area two:
Hybrid/multi cloud deployment
The move to the cloud has brought with it serious issues for organizations when it comes to their Machine Identity Management solutions. 92% of organizations have had to rethink and change these solutions as they have moved from on-premises deployments to the cloud. However, organizations haven't had overwhelming success in doing so ­ 76% of IT decision makers from organizations which are currently or planning to operate Machine Identity Management solutions across multi or hybrid cloud deployments express the belief that their organization isn't completely prepared to manage these solutions across these environments.
It is the case that organizations have started to take the steps to improve how they operate their Machine Identity Management solutions across hybrid and multi cloud environments in order to address this. 95% plan to or have already started implementing hybrid cloud deployment in the context of their Machine Identity Management solution, although only 32% have so far fully implemented this.

32% We have fully implemented this

48% We have stared to implemented this

15%

We haven't started to implemented this, but have plans to

0% 1% Don't Know

Figure 9: To what extent has your organization implemented hybrid cloud deployment in the context of its Machine Identity Management solution(s)? [1,000]

Survey Report 20

Among those who don't have plans to implement the ability to run and manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid deployment models, 74% state that an obstacle to improving their Machine Identity Management approach is that their current approach is manual and time consuming to upgrade ­ suggesting that they may be stuck using legacy tech, unable to prepare for the next generation of Machine Identity Management solutions without a total overhaul of their current approach.
The approaches that organizations are taking when it comes to operating their Machine Identity Management solutions across multi/hybrid cloud environments are varied. 40% currently or plan to have one solution covering all cloud deployments, 37% have or will have one certificate authority and solution for each cloud with a central policy, and 22% have or will have one certificate authority or solution for each cloud, without a central policy.

There are some differences between North America and Europe when it comes to this. 46% of those in North America have or will have one Machine Identity Management solution covering all cloud deployments, compared to 37% in Europe. In Europe, organizations are more likely to currently/plan to treat each cloud as an island with its own CA and Machine Identity Management solution, without a central policy (25%), compared to those in North America (17%).

Survey Report 2211

Where organizations have managed to fully implement the ability to run and manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid deployment models however, the benefits are clear. 48% of organizations who have done this hold full awareness of the certificates and keys across their digital assets, compared to only 36% of those who have started to implement this ability, or 28% of those who plan to, but haven't started yet. These benefits make clear the need for organizations to ensure they are able to run and manage certificate lifecycles on hybrid cloud deployment models. If organizations don't take the steps to manage their certificates across hybrid cloud deployments, they risk not being able to track all certificates and keys in their infrastructure, and exposure to the risks this can create. Automation and hybrid cloud deployment are not two trends emerging in isolation ­ they are intrinsically linked, and by doing both, organizations can reap even more benefits. 80% of IT security decision makers from organizations planning to implement Machine Identity Management solutions across multi or hybrid cloud, state that automation will play a crucial or very important role in doing so.
This is particularly likely to be the case in North America, where 86% report that automation will play a crucially or very important role, compared to 76% in Europe.
22

Essential area three: Machine Identity Management-as-a-Service
Along with automation and hybrid/multi cloud deployment, the third and final essential area of a Machine Identity Management solution is Machine Identity Management-as-a-Service (MIMaaS) ­ these types of solutions are likely to be widely used as part of organizations' Machine Identity Management approaches going forward. 95% are planning to implement them or have started to do so. However, this is another area where adoption is in the early stages, with only 28% having fully implemented it so far.
32% We have fully implemented this
46% We have stared to implemented this
28% We haven't started to implemented this, but have plans to
4% We have no plans to implement this
1% Don't Know
Figure 11: To what extent has your organization implemented MIMaaS (Machine Identity Management as a Service) in the context of its Machine Identity Management solution(s)? [1,000]
A key reason driving the adoption of this is the general push towards as-a-Service solutions more broadly, with this being a reason for their adoption in 54% of organizations which are planning to or have started to implement MIMaaS. However, in many cases the benefits they directly provide to Machine Identity Management processes are also influencing organizations. 49% are doing so to reduce the time they need to spend on Machine Identity Management compared to other types of solutions, 43% to reduce the complexity of their approach to Machine Identity Management, and 41% so that they require less in-house expertise. Workforce skillset is one area that is quite a challenge for organizations, particularly when it comes to automation as seen in that section - if vendors can provide a solution such a MIMaaS which helps alleviate this issue further, it will be a winning situation all round.

Respondents from organizations which have implemented, are implementing, or are planning to implement Machine Identity Management-as-a-Service. Not showing all answer options

Organizations which have fully implemented MIMaaS tend to have better awareness of the certificates and keys than those who haven't.

96% of those who have fully implemented MIMaaS have full awareness of certificates and keys across their digital assets, compared to

37% of those who have started to implement it, and

28% of those who haven't started yet but plan to.

MIMaaS therefore has great potential to simplify organizations' approaches to Machine Identity Management, and help them to overcome the issue they are currently facing in tracking digital certificates and keys across their digital assets.

However, while the benefits of MIMaaS tools are clear, there is uncertainty among organizations over the best approach to take when deploying Machine Identity Management solutions ­ this is something vendors should take note of as their advice around the benefits of each deployment model could be vital in assisting with this process. In an ideal world, 43% would deploy them as-a-Service and 41% would deploy them only in the cloud. Only a small number - 15% - would deploy them only on-premise.

Lastly, as-a-Service is more likely to be preferred by organizations in North America (45%) than Europe (42%), and by larger organizations of 5,000 or more employees (49%) than those of 1,000-2,999 employees (38%).
Survey Report 24

Conclusion:
It is clear from the research findings that the future of security lies in machine identity management and organizations need to shift focus to make Machine Identity Management an integral part of their cybersecurity strategy. But, Machine Identity Management , by itself, is a complex process. This degree of complexity is elevated when digital identities are managed across multiple geographies, networks, and cloud ecosystems. To add to this, when there's no concrete management system in place, lifecycle management becomes an ad-hoc routine that's siloed by departments, ultimately leading to a lack of visibility. In the long run, this translates to lack of agility.
The lack of a defined system to manage digital identities is simply a synonym for mismanagement. And the effects of mismanagement are often manifold leading from network outages to data breaches to federal penalties to loss of productivity and most importantly, loss of business and customer trust.
Organizations need to have a dedicated focus on governing and orchestrating these digital identities like certificates and keys, which form the building blocks of a true zero-trust framework. There is a huge paradigm shift, and it is critical for enterprises to embrace Machine Identity Management for an enhanced security posture. Organizations need to focus on crypto agility for improved digital trust, while making Machine Identity Management a vital cog in the wheel of identity and access management.
