Protect Organizations from Risk when Engaging 3rd-Party Vendors/Partners Abstract
This white paper discusses how RidgeBot capabilities--including asset discovery, attack surface identification, iterative security validation, automated and on-demand penetration testing, and vulnerability exploitation and remediation--can help organizations comply with the Service Organization Control (SOC 2) specifications. A SOC 2 certification substantially increases confidence and peace of mind when organizations engage 3rd-party vendors or partners in their business processes, for example, many security-focused organizations require SOC 2 compliance before considering a SaaS provider.
Introduction
Organizations rarely operate in isolation. Increasingly organizations of all sizes outsource aspects of their operations to leverage the economic benefits of business relationships with other organizations--service providers, cloud providers, partners, vendors--to achieve their objectives more efficiently and competitively. While these relationships may increase revenues, expand market opportunities or reduce costs for an organization, they also introduce risks arising from the interactions between the systems of the organization and those of the service organization.
The SOC 2 specifications was developed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) circa 2010, and revised in 2013 and 2017. AICPA is the national professional organization of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) in the United States, with more than 400,000 members in over 100 countries in business and industry, public practice, government, education, student affiliates and international associates. The Institute was founded in 1887 with the objective to set ethical standards for the U.S. accounting profession, as well as auditing standards for private companies, non-profit organizations, federal, state and local governments.

SOC Overview
System and Organization Controls (SOC) is a suite of service offerings CPAs may provide in connection with system-level controls of a service organization, or entitylevel controls of other organizations. The SOC suite of offerings include:
· SOC for Service Organizations: Internal-control reports on the services provided by a service organization. These reports document valuable information to enable organizations to assess and address the risks associated with an outsourced service:
° SOC 1: SOC for Service Organizations--Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) ° SOC 2: SOC for Service Organizations--Trust Services Criteria ° SOC 3: SOC for Service Organizations--Trust Services Criteria for General Use Report · SOC for Cybersecurity: A reporting framework through which organizations can communicate relevant useful information about the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management program, and CPAs can report on such information to meet the cybersecurity information needs of a broad range of stakeholders.
· SOC for Supply Chain: An internal-control report on an entity's system and controls for producing, manufacturing or distributing goods to better understand the cybersecurity risks in their supply chains.
The remainder of this white paper focuses on compliance with the requirements of the SOC 2: Trust Services Criteria, as documented here.
SOC 2 Auditing and Certification
The purpose of the SOC 2 Trust Criteria is to provide confidence and peace of mind when organizations engage 3rd-party vendors in their business processes. To achieve SOC 2 certification, an organization is audited by an independent licensed CPA who provides an attestation after determining if the organization has the appropriate safeguards and procedures in place.
Auditors provide a SOC 2 report for an organization that details the systems and controls you have in place for security compliance. Auditors check for proof and verify whether you meet the relevant trust principles. The report documents valuable information to enable organizations to assess and address the risks associated with an outsourced service
SOC 2 Trust Criteria
SOC 2 compliance enumerates specific criteria for managing customer data correctly. As is the case with other legal and industry standard requirements such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS and HIPAA, SOC 2 compliance specifications contain a mix of organizational management, process and procedural requirements, as well as technology-focused stipulations.

The SOC 2 Trust Criteria consist of 5 Trust Services Categories:
· Security
· Availability
· Processing Integrity
· Confidentiality
· Privacy
The Security Category covers access controls to prevent malicious attacks, unauthorized alteration or destruction of data, misuse of the organizations systems, or unauthorized access or disclosure of company or client information. A checklist of controls to be implemented include:
· Logical and Physical Access Controls: Restricting and managing logical and physical access to prevent unintended and unauthorized access.
· System Operations: Detecting and mitigating deviations from set procedures.
· Change Management: Implementing a process to prevent unauthorized system changes.
· Risk Mitigation: Risk mitigation activities to prevent business continuity disruptions.
The SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria are aligned with the 17 principles laid out in the COSO framework: the Internal Control Integrated Framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In addition to the 17 principles of the COSO framework, certain common criteria are shared amongst all the Trust Services Categories (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy), as well as certain added supplemental criteria applicable to each category, as given in the table below.

° Run RidgeBot attacks, scans and exploitations as a standard part of your ongoing security policy.

· Continuous Security Validation

° RidgeBot provides no-cost iterative, continuous hardening and asset inventory. You can run different scans and exploitations periodically or continuously--because it is fully
automated, no manual intervention is required until a vulnerability is reported.

° Continuous monitoring and asset discovery protect against hacker intrusion caused by an employee (or any other person) accidentally or maliciously connecting untrusted or
unplanned IoT, wireless or other unauthorized devices to the environment.

° Scan reports provide a short list of must-fix exploitable vulnerabilities to document and resolve. Report output ensures all software patches and updates needed to resolve
dangerous vulnerabilities are installed on all affected assets.

· DevOps/SecOps Software Development and Patch/Release Testing

° Use RidgeBot during the software development process to help ensure that dangerous coding practices that introduce vulnerabilities never ship in new releases of software.

° Use RidgeBot to harden software patches, software upgrades, new devices, and any configuration changes before pushing them into the production environment.

· Security Posture Validation
° Continuously, iteratively attack the production environment to maintain security posture and discover misconfigurations in wireless or defensive security appliances or services such as firewall rules or UTM appliances.
° Continuously monitor and harden login credentials on sensitive assets.
· Compliance Audit
° Continuous asset discovery scanning, and attack and exploitation attempts (and the reports issued) mean your environment is always audit-ready.
° Use RidgeBot reports to submit evidence of vulnerabilities probed, remediated and resolved.
· Security Incident Response
° Scan reports, containing recommended solutions for each vulnerability found, provide critical information to your security incident response/escalation team.
° Risk ranking of vulnerabilities feed into the priorities and procedures for incident response.
° RidgeBot AI/ML exploitation attacks provide forensic capabilities to investigate the origin and path taken by a breach, as well as step-by-step guidance on how to resolve the entry point vulnerability.
RidgeBot includes several template scans that you can easily use, as well as the flexibility to completely customize your own scans. The system templates include:
· Full scan: This test launches numerous attack techniques used by real-world hackers. Based on threat intelligence and an exploit knowledge base, RidgeBot profiles assets, mines vulnerabilities and launches attacks against target assets, which may be internal or external to your environment, in a private or public environment.
· Ransomware scan: This test is specifically focused on combating ransomware attacks. It launches scans for 27 high-profile ransomware entry point vulnerabilities, includes the ability to attack and exploit these vulnerabilities, and reports in detail exactly how successful exploitations were achieved. Definitions of more ransomware attacks will be added over time, and you can add these to your security arsenal by downloading periodic RidgeBot updates.
· Weak password scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on sensitive information collected via weak credential or unauthorized access vulnerabilities. Attack targets include redis, elasticsearch, ActiveMQ, database, web login and other applications.
· Struts2 scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on known 1-day or n-day vulnerabilities detected on targets using the Struts 2 framework.
· Weblogic scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks based on known 1-day or n-day vulnerabilities detected on targets using Weblogic middleware.
· Web scan: This test launches cyberattacks against target websites, web applications and all related attack surfaces to gain control of the target website for both self-developed and contact management system-based websites.
· Host scan: This test launches direct or iterative attacks from inside a corporate network to validate the security system's response to an internal threat. Target systems include all network-accessible internal hosts and servers.
