TOP 10 Capabilities to Look for from your SASE Provider
In a perfect world, transitioning to a SASE architecture would be as easy as pushing a button and moving your entire network architecture into a dreamy and secure cloud environment. Unfortunately, that is not the world we live in, but the transition doesn't have to be complicated and overwhelming either.
The magic of a smooth transition to a SASE architecture starts by finding the right provider for you to help you on your journey. Your SASE provider should begin by helping you leverage your existing investments, lead with experience, and help you transition to cloud-delivered security seamlessly, securely, and at a pace that is best for your business.

1 UNIFIED POLICY MANAGEMENT
Manage security anywhere and everywhere, onpremises and in the cloud, from the cloud all within a single UI.
Unified Policy Management must ensure a secure user experience with policies that follow users, devices, and applications wherever they go.

2

FAST AND EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST ADVANCED THREATS

Protect against invisible and unknown threats, even if they are encrypted.
Find a cloud-based service that performs static and dynamic malware detection that identifies and enables near real-time blocking of even the most sophisticated and evasive threats all within moments of detection.

3 RESILIENCE AND SCALABILITY
Scale for physical, virtual, and cloud-based security environments easily and effectively.
You need operational simplicity and security at scale that is invisible to the end user and never negatively impacts the user experience.

5

CONSISTENT SECURITY FOR YOUR DISTRIBUTED WORKFORCE

Give your remote workforce secure access to the applications and resources they need to do their job effectively.

Consistent security policies must follow users, devices, and applications without having to duplicate or recreate rule sets.

7 SINGLE SOURCE OF IDENTITY
Seamlessly integrates with any identity solution provider on the market.
Your SASE provider must empower you to choose the identity provider who will best serve your business needs, not the one that best fits theirs.

9 VALIDATED SECURITY EFFICACY
Do the research and find a SASE provider with proven security effectiveness.
Your SASE provider must show effective threat protection including client-side and server-side exploits, ransomware, botnets, and DNS tunneling. They must meet the challenges of the threat landscape head-on and stop attacks in your environment onpremises and in the cloud and must be delivered as-a-service.

4

SINGLE STACK ARCHITECTURE WITH A SINGLE POLICY FRAMEWORK

Leverage existing investments as an on-ramp to business-critical cloud security services.

Create policies once and apply them anywhere and everywhere with unified policy management, including user- and application-based access, IPS, anti-malware, and secure web access within a single policy.

6 SUPPORTS HYBRID ENVIRONMENTS
It shouldn't matter to your SASE provider whether your infrastructure is on-premises, in the cloud, or a combination. They should support it all.
Your SASE provider must help enable your transition to a SASE architecture seamlessly and securely, and at a pace that is best for your business.

8 DYNAMIC USER SEGMENTATION
Ensure your users are protected wherever they are.
Incorporate follow-the-user policies and provides automated access control based on risk through granular policy, locking down 3rd party access as an attack vector. Addresses 3rd party access, further reducing the attack surface at the edge.

10

TRANSITION SEAMLESSLY TO A CLOUDDELIVERED SECURITY AT YOUR OWN PACE

No one should be forcing you to move to a SASE architecture before you are ready.

Transition seamlessly to a cloud-delivered security architecture at your own pace within the same management UI with unified policy and intuitive deployment wizards. Easily and effectively orchestrate, provision, and manage policy services wherever those services are located.

11 BONUS POINTS: SECURITY ASSURANCE
Make policy rule changes confidently and ensure policy changes are effective.
Whether it's a rule for a traditional firewall policy or policy delivered as a service, they must be placed in proper order so they're effective. Your SASE provider must help your IT team make sense of these rule sets and automatically surface duplicate and shadowed rules before they're committed.

Every SASE journey will be unique to you and your organization, but ultimately it is your choice how you go about the design, build, and maintain this new architecture to optimize the user experience, services, and data you need when you need it. Whichever path you choose, it is critical to have a provider that can help you implement SASE by meeting you where you are and is with you every step of the way on your journey.
