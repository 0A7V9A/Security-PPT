THE MID-MARKET CHALLENGE
THE MID-MARKET STILL HAS BIG CHALLENGES: QUANTIFIED
QUANTIFYING THE MID-MARKET CHALLENGE:
· 28% of middle market executives claimed that their company experienced a data breach in 2020, up from 18% in 2019.
· 42% of executives at larger middle market organizations reported a breach, compared to 16% at smaller counterparts.
· The middle market has the exposure and digital assets to make them an attractive target for data theft.
· The expectation to know the cybersecurity market. · They also struggle to lure or maintain cybersecurity talent and balance the
resource constraints of a mid sized business.

· Cyberinsurance is still maturing with actuarial models evolving, in some cases causing rapid swings from year to year for rates and coverage.
· The mid-market has driven the bulk of claims submitted, though what this means for the future isn't certain, but given the disproportionate share of claims going to mid-market firms one can conclude the market will adjust to a more even distribution.
· To get there, will firms see their rates increase? Coverage decrease?
· Security leaders need to take steps to reduce their reliance on insurance claims.

MID-MARKET BUSINESSES RELY ON THE SAME SENSITIVE DATA AS GLOBAL ENTERPRISES

Just because your organizations lives in the middle, it doesn't mean the types and volumes of sensitive data are any simpler to protect than the large enterprises. As a security leader you need locate (Data Discovery) and understand (Data Classification) all the data in your business to deliver the protection (Data Loss Prevention) for secure growth.
While there are commonalities, each industry and business will have unique data types or data type combinations.

Finance · PCI · Shares and
Repositories · PII · Web Sites
Technology · PII · Source Code · CCPA · Web Sites

HealthCare · HIPPA · Medical Records · PCI · Web Sites

Manufacturing · Compliance (like
ITAR) · Repositories · Intellectual Property

Retail · PCI · Employee Data · Customer Data · File Types

MID-MARKET REQUIRES DATA GOVERNANCE
Once you've discovered and classified your data, the next step is the control and retainment of your data as part of your overall governance program.

Organization wide visibility is paramount. Data lives on endpoints, in storage repositories, in the cloud, and moves among them. Real time visibility and analysis of the movement delivers the insights to spot data risks or trends that can become data risks. Blind spots here cause big problems.

Visibility without control is useless. Telling you data left without an ability to stop it delivers minimal value. Data protection solutions *must* be able to automatically stop the activities your team deems the highest risk.

Balancing the conflicting interests may take adjustments and is driven by industry, regulatory environment, and corporate culture. Over time you will need to modify where the line between too strict and too lenient is. A data protection program must evolve to stay relevant.

SECURITY STAFFING IS BIGGER ISSUES FOR THE MID-MARKET
Of the big three, People, Process & Technology, people come first. Without the right team, few solutions can be effective. Mid-market security leaders have the task of hiring and maintaining their team when the lure of larger companies can decimate a lean team. A mid-market company may have 2-3 dedicated security people, losing 1 really hurts!

In a mid-market company, the team needs to function well. Conflict in a team of only a few people can kill communication and effectiveness in no time. This lack of good process is what leads to missed alerts and alarms... and leads to data loss.

The good side of a small team is it's easy to know who to talk to for local knowledge. It's rarely more than a few people away. That unique setting in the firewall can be explained...but that if that person leaves and the local knowledge goes too, then what?

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR THE MID-MARKET

Accepting the reality that not all the answers to all your cybersecurity challenges exist inside the (virtual) walls of your business is the 1st step.

77% seek external expertise

"Among organizations with 1,000­9,999 employees, only 23 percent said they rely most on internal staff for security expertise."

There are new tactics, techniques, and procedures that organizations need to stay on top of. Many security teams are lean, and in the case of mid-market enterprises, often handle information technology and information security, the challenge doubles. There simply isn't enough time in the day to do your job and stay fresh on the changing environments. New malware, new ransomware, new steal-your-data-ware.

DG has a broad collection of customers in our managed services program - manufacturing, high tech, healthcare, financial services, business services, etc. They all rely on us to protect both their intellectual property and their regulated data.

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR THE MID-MARKET

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR THE MID-MARKET

We analyzed all those customers to see how they were using DG, looking for patterns across industry size, vertical, etc. We found a core set of control rules and types of controls that tracked data egressing through a core group of channels. We also noticed the data had a pattern of classification categories. All these combined for a data-driven data protection solution.

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR

THE MID-MARKET

From our data, 9 core uses cases in 2 broad categories covered the bulk of what customers needed.*

1) Data Discovery

LOCATE AND IDENTIFY

2) Data classification (content-based and context-
based)

3) Visibility into data usage without policy

CONTROL AND RETAIN

*If your data protection needs fall outside of this, Digital Guardian also offers a full and customizable suite of Data Loss Prevention options to protect your organization.

4) Web Browser

5) Email

6) Copy and paste

7) Printing

8) USB / removable
media

9) Archiving

DATA PROTECTION USE CASES

Locate and identify is where we start. The adage goes, if you can't see it, you can't protect it. And a corollary to that, if you can't understand it, you can't effectively protect it.
1st priority is the find and classify your data. This includes data movement that you are unaware of too, Visibility into data usage without a policy is something only DG delivers. It's rare for a company to have 100% knowledge of 100% of their data.

LOCATE AND IDENTIFY

1) Data Discovery
It's as simple as it sounds, find all the data, but can be a complex challenge with endpoint data, NAS data, cloud data, etc. You need a baseline of your data to design a proper data protection program.

2) Data classification (content-based and context-
based)
Once you found it, you need to organize it into discrete, meaningful categories. Here, more isn't always better. Starting with 3 (Regulated, Internal, & Public) is where we recommend you start

3) Visibility into data usage without policy
Being able to track data movement without a policy is unique to DG, and yields the most complete view of data movement. From here you can build a data driven, and far more effective program.

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR THE MID-MARKET

DATA PROTECTION USE CASES

Next, Control and Retain, is the proactive data protection that can stop data loss before it happens. This can be from either a user simply trying to get their job done and inadvertently putting data at risk, or intentional and malicious actions.

CONTROL AND RETAIN

4) Web Browser

5) Email

6) Copy and Paste

More and more apps are browser based, many of these touch sensitive data, or can be used to transmit sensitive data. Seeing data in these apps can help safeguard it.

We're in email almost all day, and with this familiarity comes complacency. Entering sensitive data into email can be a potential data loss vector when auto-fill grabs the wrong address or you are simply sending what you shouldn't.

Yes, it saves us time during the day, but can also speed up the data loss process. Grabbing a large chunk of text may include sensitive data that shouldn't be shared externally.

16

DESIGNING A DLP PROGRAM FOR THE MID-MARKET

DATA PROTECTION USE CASES

Part 2 of Control and Retain expands upon the common data protection uses cases we see and rounds out the 9 core use cases we saw in the data analyzed.

LOCATE AND IDENTIFY

7) Printing

8) USB/removable media

9) Archiving

This may seem an outdated method for data loss, but with all the remote workers printing remans a top concern. Once it's on paper, there is no way for InfoSec teams to track or protect the data.

The "candy drop" attack is still out there, but more common is saving data to a USB and losing it, putting data at risk. With the remote workforce, this vector saw tremendous growth.

Putting information into an archive can facilitate transfer, but it can also obfuscate what's in the file. Seeing what is being archived *before* it happens lets infosec teams make informed decisions.

WHY DIGITAL GUARDIAN?
INCREASING SPEED TO LEND; REDUCING DATA LOSS RISK FOR RE INVESTORS

SITUATION A rapidly expanding, private financial services firm with a focus on real estate investors, needed to reduce information security and regulatory compliance complexity without sacrificing protection of their clients' sensitive data. Their existing data protection platform was driving up support costs, slowing down lending times, and costing them customers. They needed a better way to protect PII and PCI data.

SOLUTION The organization, working closely with their data security channel partner, deployed the DG Managed Security Program DLP for Mid-Market across their entire organization. The CIO was sold on the datacentric view the platform provided along with the fully cloud hosted delivery model. They were able to eliminate the on-site complexity of their previous data loss prevention solution and gain access to the 24x7 cybersecurity experts, both helping to offload work from their IT/IS team.

RESULTS During the deployment, DG helped the IT/IS team improve upon their data protection rules, ensuring sensitive data could safely move as needed to speed their business processes. Their DG analyst instantly became a part of their security team, bringing the DLP expertise they needed. Finally, with the cloudbased solution, the customer went through the planning and deployment process in a few weeks.
