Atlas - The Next-Generation Cloud Certificate Authority

For Today's Overleveraged Enterprise IT and Security Teams
While public key infrastructure (PKI) is generally recognized as one of the strongest foundations for information security, PKI continues to be a challenge for many companies. Global enterprises are losing million per year in costs and penalties as a result of mistakes with PKI. It requires a high level of training, in an area that is already dealing with a substantial shortage of qualified talent.
Additionally, as organizations scale in size, PKI complexity increases as well. There are more identities to manage, more touchpoints, and more considerations to factor in. The typical enterprise organization is running between 50-70 security programs or platforms and the teams managing them are struggling to keep up. And, with the booming Internet of Things (IoT) and DevOps market, the number of PKI use cases continues to grow. Some reports estimate there will be over 40 billion IoT devices by 2027, all of which will need to be secured. The demand for automation ­ and the crypto agility to deal with a constant stream of cyber threats ­ is greater than ever.
What organizations need is a solution for issuing and managing this ever-growing number of certificates that is reliable, flexible, and scalable.
