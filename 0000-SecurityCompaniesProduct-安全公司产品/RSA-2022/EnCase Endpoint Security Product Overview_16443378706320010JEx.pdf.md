Product overview

OpenText EnCase Endpoint Security
Deep endpoint visibility for earlier detection of insider and external threats, alerts validation and forensic-grade incident response including complete remediation

Earlier detection of endpoint security threats
Faster response to malicious activity of up to 90%
More efficient recovery from security incidents of up to 77%
Greater visibility via continuous monitoring of endpoints

The rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape is reducing the effectiveness of traditional perimeter and signature-based security systems. Additionally, Security Information Event Management (SIEM) and other alerting technologies are bombarding security teams with alerts, overtaxing their ability to analyze, prioritize and respond to threats before irreparable damage or data loss occurs. Organizations need to establish better visibility into endpoints to face these challenges.
OpenTextTM EnCaseTM Endpoint Security provides security teams with 360-degree endpoint visibility to validate, analyze, scope and respond to incidents quickly and completely. As a best-of-breed Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution, it empowers organizations to tackle the most advanced forms of attack at the endpoint, whether from external actors or internal threats. EnCase Endpoint Security is designed with automation and operational efficiencies that help incident responders find and triage security incidents faster to reduce the risk of loss or damage.
Earlier detection of endpoint security threats
EnCase Endpoint Security enables security teams to redefine their workflow from passive `alerting' mode to proactive `threat hunting', actively scanning for anomalies indicative of a security breach. It creates a baseline of endpoint activity used to detect anomalous behavior or recreate how a data breach occurred using historical intelligence.

Faster response to malicious activity
EnCase Endpoint Security accelerates response time, significantly reducing the risk of data loss and damage to systems. It reduces triage time by up to 90%, helping incident response (IR) teams validate and assess the impact of malicious activity ­ even polymorphic or memory-resident malware. Organizations can realize even greater efficiencies by integrating EnCase Endpoint Security with third-party alerting technologies via RESTful APIs.
More efficient recovery from security incidents
Once a threat is identified, EnCase Endpoint Security surgically contains and remediates malicious files, processes and registry keys without the need to conduct a full wipe-and-reimage. This approach avoids the costly system downtime, loss in productivity and lost revenue associated with traditional forms of remediation, reducing the time to remediate a threat by approximately 77%.
Greater visibility via continuous monitoring of endpoints
Today's security teams require the ability to capture endpoint data on an ongoing basis to quickly identify changes and create a historical timeline of activity for root-cause analysis. Configurable realtime, continuous monitoring capabilities provide the necessary level of visibility and insight required to monitor all network endpoints at any scale.

OpenText EnCase Endpoint Security features

Complete endpoint visibility with advanced detection Integrated and streamlined alert notifications with realtime, continuous monitoring and timeline analysis; cloud-based threat intelligence and automated reputation lookup are also available.

Tools for actionable insight

· Timeline and differential analysis for root cause analysis. · Ability to flag processes, IPs or connections of interest. · Process tree visualization and navigation. · IOC scans that support YARA and STIX. · Forensic-grade remediation of files, registry keys and system processes.

Automated response workflows

Purpose-built automation tools and integrations with open RESTful APIs to mitigate security risks and reduce costs associated with incident response.

Bi-directional Splunk integration

Ensures all event data generated within EnCase Endpoint Security can be automatically exported into Splunk, including all processes, DLLs, connections and DNS. Bi-directional integration enables incident responders to triage their security events directly within Splunk for a "single-pane-of-glass" experience.

Differential analysis

Enables security analysts to quickly conduct efficient root cause analysis. With any given security event, incident responders can rapidly compare snapshots from the target endpoint to any other baseline snapshot--whether on the same machine or a different one.

Metadata scans

Allows users to create data collection scans that take daily snapshots of metadata, like DLLs and processes, from one or more host machines for efficient review, comparison and analysis.

Secure Authentication for EnCase (SAFE) architecture Authenticates users, retains transaction logs and brokers secure data transmission to ensure no information can be intercepted and interpreted.

Intuitive UI and workflows

A modern and streamlined user interface, intuitive for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts or early Incident Response (IR) responders, to reduce human error and save time and frustration.
