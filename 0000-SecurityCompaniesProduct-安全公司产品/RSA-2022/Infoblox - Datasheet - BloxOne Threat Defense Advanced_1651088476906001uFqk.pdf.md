DATA SHEET
BloxOne® Threat Defense Advanced
Strengthen and Optimize Your Security Posture from the Foundation

KEY CAPABILITIES
· Secure existing networks and digital transformations like SD-WAN, IoT and cloud leveraging existing infrastructure
· Prevent data exfiltration techniques with analytics and machine learning including DNS-based data exfiltration, DGA, DNSMessenger, and fast-flux attacks
· Detect and block exploits, phishing, ransomware and other modern malware
· Identify malware propagation and lateral movement through east-west traffic monitoring
· Restrict user access to certain web content categories and track activity
· Protect your brand with Lookalike Domain Monitoring for your most valuable internet properties
· Reduce response times through automated blocking and sharing of incident detailsto 3rd party ecosystem solutions through public APIs or onpremises integrations
· Accelerate investigations 3X and streamline threat hunting
· Enhance visibility: Get precise visibility "and rich network context including IPAM and asset metadata about your network devices for better correlation of events
· Control the risks of rising DoH use: block DoH (DNS over HTTPS) domain access and gracefully revert DoH requests to existing, trusted DNS

The Need for Foundational Security at Scale
The traditional security model is inadequate in today's world of digital transformations.
· The perimeter has shifted, and your users directly access cloudbased applications from everywhere.
· SD-WAN drives network transformation and branch offices directly connect to Internet with no ability to replicate full HQ security stack.
· IoT leads to an explosion of devices that do not accept traditional endpoint technologies for protection.
· Most security systems are complex, and do not easily scale to the level needed to protect these dynamic environments.
Moreover, security operations teams are chronically short staffed (there is a shortage of 2.93 million security operations personnel worldwide according to a recent ISC2 report), use siloed tools and manual processes to gather information, and must deal with hundreds to thousands of alerts everyday.
What organizations need is a scalable, simple and automated security solution that protects the entire network without the need to deploy or manage additional infrastructure.
Infoblox Provides a Scalable Platform That Maximizes Your Existing Threat Defense Investment
Infoblox BloxOne Threat Defense strengthens and optimizes your security posture from the foundation up. It maximizes brand protection by securing your existing networks as well as digital imperatives like SD-WAN, IoT and the cloud. It uses a hybrid architecture for pervasive, inside-out protection, powers security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) solutions by providing rich network and threat context, optimizes the performance of the entire security ecosystem and reduces your total cost of enterprise threat defense.

Maximize Security Operation Center Efficiency
Reduce Incident Response Time · Automatically block malicious activity and provide the threat data to the rest of your security ecosystem
for investigation, quarantine and remediation
· Optimize your SOAR solution using contextual network and threat intelligence data, and Infoblox ecosystem integrations (a critical enabler of SOAR)-reduce threat response time and OPEX
· Reduce number of alerts to review and the noise from your firewalls
Unify Security Policy with Threat Intel Portability · Collect and manage curated threat intelligence data from internal and external sources and distribute it
to existing security systems
· Reduce cost of threat feeds while improving effectiveness of threat intel across entire security portfolio
Faster Threat Investigation and Hunting · Makes your threat analysts team 3x more productive by empowering security analysts with automated
threat investigation, insights into related threats and additional research perspectives from expert cyber sources to make quick, accurate decisions on threats.
· Reduce human analytical capital needed

"In this day and age there is way too much ransomware, spyware, and adware coming in over links opened by Internet users. The Infoblox cloud security solution helps block users from redirects that take them to bad sites, keeps machines from becoming infected, and keeps users safer."
Senior System Administrator and Network Engineer, City University of Seattle

THE ROI OF INFOBLOX SECURITY
Offload strained security devices · Decrease the burden on strained
perimeter security devices such as firewalls, IPS, and web proxies by using your already available DNS servers as the first line of defense
· Up to 60 times reduction in traffic sent to NGFWs*
Improve ROI on existing investments · Get more value out of adjacent/
complementary products by bidirectionally sharing threat and attacker information
· If sending DNS data to SIEM, reduce the cost of SIEM solutions by sending only suspicious DNS data sent to these platforms
Automation · Reduce cost of human touch/error
using automation
· Overcome lack of skilled resources - 60% less demand on your team to implement (configure in hours instead of months) and operate, for both skills and cost
· Make your threat analysts 3x more productive with an easy to use, single console for deep threat intelligence
· Based on real customer data

Hybrid Approach Protects Wherever You are Deployed

Analytics in the Cloud

Threat Intel Scaling

Full Integration with On-premises
Ecosystem

Remote Survivability

·Detect more threats in the cloud and enforce anywhere

·Apply more threat intel in the cloud without limitations of appliance

·Enable faster response ·Achieve network wide remediation

·Continue to protect and service clients even if connection to internet is down

Analytics in the Cloud · Leverage greater processing capabilities of the cloud to detect a wider
range of threats, including data exfiltration, domain generation algorithm (DGA), fast flux, fileless malware, Dictionary DGA and more using machine learning based analytics
