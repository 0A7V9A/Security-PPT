Introduction
As IT infrastructure has grown in scope and complexity, vulnerability reports have soared. In 2020, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) added 29,867 new vulnerabilities.
With more sophisticated infrastructure comes a rise in the complexity and visibility of vulnerabilities. Past issues that went unnoticed, at least for long periods, are discovered daily today.
Organizations need a mechanism to uncover vulnerabilities in their digital assets or risk damaging and costly security incidents. Basic controls like scanners help alleviate the problem by providing broad coverage for basic security issues, but there's no substitute for the testing depth and creativity offered by expert human testers.
What is a Pentest?
A pentest is a foundational requirement for any security program. Pentest engagements enlist human expertise to scrutinize digital assets--most commonly software--with the objective of uncovering and resolving security vulnerabilities before a malicious actor can exploit them. Despite their critical role, many organizations misunderstand pentests.
Traditional pentests are engagements delivered by a security services provider that attempt to find vulnerabilities in a specified asset or group of assets. In most cases, testing is delivered by on-staff security experts and follows a checklist-based approach. While this can help to ensure consistency and coverage between engagements--an important consideration, particularly for compliance-driven testing--it also limits the effectiveness of pentest engagements for finding non-standard vulnerabilities.
Today, pentests can go beyond these limited engagements to deliver comprehensive security and compliance benefits. The most important addition is diversity, both of testers and testing practices.
Where traditional penetration testing relies on a small pool of on-staff experts, organizations now have access to a huge pool of testers worldwide through the global hacker community. This introduces a far wider range of expertise, techniques, and tools to the pentest process, helping to uncover more exploitable and high-risk vulnerabilities--once again, before a malicious actor can exploit them.

Why Pentest?
Organizations need pentesting that supports key business objectives. These begin with basic regulatory and compliance obligations, but ultimately encompass a wider range of security, risk reduction, and business needs. The most common pentesting objectives include:
1. Compliance -- Almost all regulatory and compliance frameworks like FedRAMP, NIST, and CISA require organizations to conduct pentests, usually on an annual basis.
2. Meeting stakeholder requirements -- Many organizations will only work with partners or customers that uphold certain security standards.
3. Protecting assets and preventing downtime -- Damage and disruption to digital assets can be costly. With the right visibility into application and system vulnerabilities, organizations minimize their risk.
4. Protecting customer data -- Sensitive data is heavily regulated, and it's also an asset used to understand customers and improve products and service. Securing that data is both a business imperative and a regulatory requirement.
5. Minimizing cyber risk -- Data breaches are a substantial risk and cause financial, operational, and reputational damage. The IBM 2021 Cost of a Data Breach report found breaches cost on average $5.52 million. Security testing like pentests help organizations understand and proactively manage risk with valuable vulnerability intelligence.
6. Supporting software and product development -- Organizations need more frequent and thorough pentests that deliver timely information to support rapid development cycles and allow collaboration between security and development teams. Ideally, organizations choose a combination of external pentesting and internal controls that supports existing development workflows (e.g., DevOps or CI/ CD pipelines) and reliably delivers secure code to production.
While improving security and reducing risk are top priorities, compliance has historically been the main driver for penetration testing. Failure to meet compliance requirements can result in multi-million dollar fines, and until recently the risk associated with these fines was often greater than the risk of a security breach.
Most penetration testing providers deliver a simple approach to meet testing requirements across various regulations and frameworks.
But organizations' needs go beyond passing audits and checking a box, and penetration testing engagements must evolve to support the more pressing need for proactive cyber risk management. The use of pentesting for additional risk management by finding vulnerabilities before exploitation extends an organization's security profile while still meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.

Additionally, as dependence on software and non-traditional network architecture grows, the need to maximize security has overtaken compliance as the most important consideration for many organizations. Organizations now need additional pentest options that go beyond compliance coverage to proactively reduce cyber risk by uncovering vulnerabilities throughout the attack surface--including cloud and hybrid infrastructure. These options must combine more advanced testing for security weaknesses with the flexibility to support regular updates to business-critical software assets.

Which Pentest is Right for Your Organization?
Many organizations have a variety of security and compliance objectives that require pentesting. Organizations can combine various pentests to achieve these objectives and support security, IT, and development workflows.
Earlier in this guide, we listed seven common objectives for pentesting, beginning with the most basic: 1. Compliance 2. Stakeholder requirements 3. Protecting assets and preventing downtime 4. Protecting customer data 5. Minimizing cyber risk 6. Protecting reputation 7. Supporting internal software and product development
Compliance and Stakeholder Requirements
These needs are the most rigid in their criteria. Since stakeholder requirements are often linked to compliance frameworks, this section will address both objectives together.
To ensure compliance, your organization must determine what its obligations are, legal and otherwise. However, most compliance frameworks lack specific guidance.
For example, the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) requires U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors to: "Conduct penetration testing periodically, leveraging automated scanning tools and ad hoc tests using human experts."
Other examples of vague requirements include:
 I SO 27001: "[...] information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used shall be obtained in a timely fashion, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk."
 N IST 800-53: "Employ an independent penetration testing agent or team to perform penetration testing on the system or system components. [...] Independent penetration testing agents or teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational systems."
Your organization can choose any pentest for compliance and stakeholder requirements--as long as it meets these criteria. This leaves your organization free to select pentests that support internal security and risk reduction objectives rather than choosing a pentest purely to satisfy a compliance checkbox.

Security and Risk Reduction
Depending on your organization's objectives, you should choose a pentest (or combination of pentests) accordingly. For example:
 Protecting assets, preventing downtime, and protecting customer data require your organization to maximize security. You can achieve this with a continuous hacker-powered pentest which exposes assets to a wide range of techniques.
 Minimizing cyber risk requires pentests that combine broad asset coverage with exposure to real-world cybercriminal tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Continuous and one-off hacker-powered pentests are ideal for protecting reputation, as this is one component of cyber risk.
 Supporting internal software and product development requires a pentest that can be arranged quickly with no wait time. It should also provide immediate communication with pentesters, allowing developers to clarify issues and request prompt retesting of patched vulnerabilities. Hacker-powered pentests are ideal because they provide real-time access to ethical hackers with diverse expertise and skill sets.
"Being able to have issues retested during the same engagement is a game-changer. That's something that hasn't been available in the past because traditionally, you didn't receive the results of a penetration test until after the engagement was over."
Rich Kellen, VP and CISO Wind River
Your organization should combine pentest options as needed to support current and ongoing needs. For example, you may use a continuous hacker-powered program for ongoing security coverage, hacker-powered pentests to support development roadmaps and most compliance objectives, and a traditional penetration test for PCI-DSS compliance.

"Being able to have issues retested during the same engagement is a gamechanger. That's something that hasn't been available in the past because traditionally, you didn't receive the results of a penetration test until after the engagement was over."

Tracking Pentest ROI
Ideally, organizations would measure pentest return on investment (ROI) using a metric such as a dollar value or measurable risk reduction. However, this is challenging because pentests are preventative measures. It's impossible to know which vulnerabilities, if not reported, would have led to a security incident or breach.
While most organizations can't measure pentest ROI in these concrete terms, there are several metrics organizations can use to track their pentest value or compare the effectiveness of different pentests. While cyber risk reduction can be difficult to quantify, the metrics below are useful guidelines for organizations without a mature risk management program.

Tracking pentest metrics manually can be difficult and prone to error. HackerOne makes it easy to track metrics, export data to security tools, and correlate pentest results with other activities, e.g., product releases and updates, program scope changes, and external events.

 Reduction in cyber incidents related to vulnerability exploits -- Completely avoiding incidents related to malicious hacking isn't possible -- but a combination of pentest engagements should lead to incident reduction.
 Number of vulnerabilities reported over time -- A mature pentest should expose assets to a broad and evolving range of TTPs, so vulnerabilities should continue to be reported over time, particularly for regularly updated assets.
 Number of critical vulnerabilities reported -- A pentest that consistently finds critical vulnerabilities demonstrates a high ROI because it limits security breach risk.
 Breadth of program coverage -- An ideal combination of pentest engagements provides coverage (and vulnerability reports) for all assets.
 Internal effort required to manage the program -- Traditional penetration tests often require an internal coordinator. A platform avoids this resource cost by allowing direct communication between security practitioners, developers, and the testing team.
 Ability to support development without delaying roadmaps -- Speed and flexibility are critical. Pentests that support release schedules have a high ROI, as they support business profitability.

Tracking these metrics will help organizations understand how their investment in pentesting correlates with results and see how different pentests compare.

It's Easier with a Platform
T racking pentest metrics manually can be difficult and prone to error. HackerOne makes it easy to track metrics, export data to security tools, and correlate pentest results with other activities, e.g., product releases and updates, program scope changes, external events, etc.
