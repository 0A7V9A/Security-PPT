CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT Cyber crime is on the rise. The number of data breaches is on an upward trend ­ and those breaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated, costing organizations and agencies billions of dollars in a matter of minutes.

This ever-increasing risk requires security professionals with the right skills and expertise to address and combat potential cyber attacks. Unfortunately, there is a growing shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals ­ one that is only expected to get worse. Cybersecurity training and education can address that gap and help your organization protect against cyber crime.

OUR COMMITMENT TO THE LEARNING CONTINUUM
Embracing new technologies and capabilities across your ecosystem, as well as through its lifecycle, requires continuous education and training. To this end, our Learning Experience Portal (LXP) supports a learning continuum, where we make available targeted,

timely assets to address any given situation across that lifecycle. Training programs cover users prior to receiving the solution, during implementation and ongoing deployment. Following deployment we provide ongoing updates and information about additional features.

TOP CYBERSECURITY CONCERNS

The uncertainty and financial implications of a cyber attack have made cybersecurity a top concern for organizations. Our training programs can help you address these areas:

Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks This is the weapon of choice for disrupting networks, servers and websites. TDoS / DDoS taps into large numbers of compromised computers, as well as other electronic devices to force the shutdown of targeted assets.

Ransomware Resurgence Agencies are being targeted with more sophisticated ransomware as hostile actors refine and shift their tactics to maximize success. The longer a ransomware attack endures, the higher the potential losses to all system facets.

Incident Response Readiness Effectively prepare for, defend against and respond to cyber attacks. Key elements of an effective response plan include risk assessment, threat intelligence collection, data analysis and postattack response.

Cloud Security Prioritization Cloud security is the next evolution that IT departments need to consider. As the volume of data increases in the network so do the risks. Keeping data safe and secure is a prime consideration for enterprises today.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Privacy Planning The complexity of public safety operations creates unique challenges in developing and implementing a risk management approach that ensures data privacy is addressed and ensured at all times.

POPULAR CYBERSECURITY COURSES
Cybersecurity Training from Motorola Solutions can give you the skills needed to navigate an increasingly complicated cyber world. The following is an overview of our most popular courses. Contact us for more information on these courses or for topics not listed below.

incident response at your own pace. This self-directed, self-paced Computer Based Training (CBT) program shows you how to effectively prepare for, defend against and respond to cyber attacks. Specifically covered in the course is risk assessment, threat intelligence collection, data analysis and post-attack response.

This course provides your entire workforce with end-user awareness training. It focuses on the specific threat landscape impacting public safety today, shown through the perspectives of social engineering, phishing and malware. Also included is a review of best practices that both individuals and organizations alike can use to guard against these threats.
CYBER FUNDAMENTALS ONLINE EDITION Audience: Individuals who need to understand cybersecurity implications on their system as well as those who need to reskill and / or upskill.
This course provides a high-level overview of various aspects of cybersecurity in the context of a modern and internet-connected environment. You will gain a foundational perspective on the challenges of designing a cybersecurity program, implementing secure systems and other factors needed for a comprehensive cybersecurity solution. Upon completion of this course, you will be able to define cybersecurity terminology, adhere to compliance requirements, triage basic attacks and understand the impact of current threat trends on cybersecurity implementation.
CYBER INCIDENCE RESPONSE Audience: Security operations individuals whose roles require them to identify and respond to cyber attacks.
Recognizing the need for flexible learning schedules, the cyber incidence response course offers you the opportunity to master the steps to cyber

COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF NIST 800-171 UPDATES Audience: Enterprise stakeholders who are either doing business with / or want to do business with the US Federal Government and must understand CUI compliance.
To provide some background, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created Special Publication 800-171 to help protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Simply put, CUI is information that is sensitive and relevant to the interests of the United States, but not strictly regulated by the Federal government. If you or your organization are interested in and subject to the requirements and regulations of NIST SP 800-171 this course is for you. It offers a primer on exactly what constitutes CUI, along with a detailed discussion of the 14 domains of compliance implementation and verification.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (RMF) FOR DOD SECURITY CONTROLS ASSESSOR (SCA) Audience: Individuals who are tasked with the responsibility to conduct independent technical assessments of security controls.
This course first focuses on understanding how to use various security documents and then how to validate NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4 Security Controls to meet the requirements for the Assessment and Authorization phases of the IT system. The course was developed to help individuals who have the assigned roles and responsibilities of a Validator or an Assessor. It also provides students who are not Validators with the insight into how the security controls will be assessed.
