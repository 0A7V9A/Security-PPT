IoT Edge Enroll

Simplify PKI Device Enrollment Set Up and Integration
Optimize IoT Device Enrollment Operation
Harden IoT Security and Authentication
Proper PKI device enrollment is key to provisioning unique, strong and secure devices identities. IoT Edge Enroll is a full-featured, registration authority service that ensures secure and optimized device enrollment. It's a key component of our PKI-based IoT Identity Platform that enables Device Identity Lifecycle Management. It's the most comprehensive, flexible, commercial PKI device enrollment feature set available.

BENEFITS
IoT Edge Enroll  Powerful, cloud-based device
Registration Authority as a Service  Simplified implementation and
management of device enrollment  The most comprehensive
commercial RA feature set available, built on a single framework with advanced control and management  Hardened security via stringent enrollment authentication and policy enforcement, communication encryption and secure identity storage  Seamless integration with our GlobalSign Certificate Authority  Experts guidance for RA set up with pre-configured workflows and custom certificate profiles and templates  Standard-based API for interoperability  Minimizes the impact of security integration, enabling device manufacturers and operators to their core IoT innovations

How it's built - Extensible and Secure
IoT Edge Enroll is built on a modular, extensible framework making it flexible for evolving and emerging IoT needs. It's fully integrated with GlobalSign's Certificate Authority (CA) so customers can select the root of trust they need ­ dedicated private hierarchies, branded public intermediate CAs, shared public or private roots of trust. It is scalable with high-performance processing and meets FIPS 140-2, level 3 standards.
It uses standards-based device enrollment protocols with dedicated enrollment servers to speed integration and maintain secure interoperability. Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST RFC 7030), EST Client, and CMP v2. It includes support for secure elements such as SRAM PUF, Secure MCUs, HSMs and TPMs including TPM 2.0 identity attestation integration. It uses custom x .509 certificate profiles and templates to tackle tough IoT requirements and can be applied to all types of x .509 certificates. It integrates with top IoT platforms and cloud applications including Azure IoT Hub, DPS and Edge, AWS IoT Core, and Arm Pelion.

Who is IoT Edge Enroll for?
 IoT device manufacturers including components with certificateauthenticated identities (IDevIDs) in their connected products
 Critical infrastructure operators looking to reduce the costly operational expense and liability of on-premise device registration, enrollment and management
 Semiconductor manufacturers producing identity-embedded microcontrollers or Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) to create competitive advantage for downstream supply chain security
 IoT developers wanting to secure device identity from production through deployment

IoT Edge Enroll is an Intregral Part of the GlobalSign IoT Identity Platform
Certificate Templating Engine for Exacting Enrollment Leverage custom certificate fields and data to deliver maximum flexibility for unique IoT authentication requirements. The certificate templating engine enables the creation of logical mapping or derivation rules to dynamically generates custom certificate fields from external sources and authenticates against enrollment policies to maintain certificate and data integrity.
Device Identity Manager for Admin Control The device identity manager consolidates RA functionality enabling effective management without specific PKI or RA expertise. With a dedicated admin API, it facilitates certificate auditing, reporting, device whitelist management and device enablement/ disablement. Admins can manage unique device identities throughout their lifecycles, set eligibility for device enrollment on a group or individual level, or register new devices as well as deprecate old devices.

Enrollment Policy Engine for Enhanced Security
Configure trust chains by defining enforcement rules to easily set the level of authentication for enhanced security and compliance. Flexible and customizable enrollment policies allow for more stringent authentication protocols, while leveraging plug-in connections and supporting TPM attestation for secure hardware.
Plug-in Architecture for Customizing Enrollment
Plug-in features and functions can call external sources and code for maximum flexibility. Build API integrations to 3rd party data sources for enrollment attestation requirements or to build certificate templating enrollment and authentication rules.
Custom Workflows Address Unique IoT Use Cases
There is no one standard. Enrollment workflows accommodate each individual IoT use case based on specific parameters, while still maintaining a predictable, repeatable and secure enrollment process. Workflows incorporate the certificate templating engine, enrollment policies, plug-in architecture, and GlobalSign's CA for seamless processing.
Enables Device Identity Lifecycle Management
Manage device identities through all five stages of their lifecycles. From initial securty by design to birth certificate provisioning and local certificate provisioning, during their useful life and through to their end of life.
