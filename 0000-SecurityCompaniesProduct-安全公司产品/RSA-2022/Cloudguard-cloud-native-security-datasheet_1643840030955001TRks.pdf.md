Cloud Workload Protection
CloudGuard Workload Protection provides seamless vulnerability assessment and runtime protection of modern cloud workloads, including serverless functions and containers ­ automating security with minimal overhead across your multi-cloud environment. Continuously scan workload environments to increase security posture and provide continuous observability and assessment, with self-protection to continuously evaluate and adapt security posture.
Cloud Web App & API Protection
CloudGuard moves application security closer to the edge of the workload, giving more real-time granular protection than a traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). CloudGuard protects web applications and APIs from the most sophisticated types of threats, with an automated, cloud-native security platform. Where traditional WAFs are built using "one-size-fits-all" rule tables even though no two applications are the same, CloudGuard transcends rule-based security by leveraging the power of AI. Automation is a critical component which ensures that security is maintained even in dynamic app development cycles.
