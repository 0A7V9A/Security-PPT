Onspring Case Study: Contract, Vendor & IT Asset Management

Contract, Vendor & IT Asset Management
A Technology Services Case Study

OVERVIEW
Building technology roadmaps as a CTO-as-a-Service provider was so successful for Leverage Corporation that it was only a matter of time before they expanded into technology sourcing, servicing, and asset management to better serve their nationwide customer base.
They outgrew a home-coded, spreadsheet-fueled data warehouse and were looking for a unified tool that could offer more capacity, more efficiency, and better data visualizations.
Enter Onspring. Not only was Leverage Corporation able to offset laborious processes, but Onspring's out-of-the-box apps helped the CEO reimagine their business model, which now includes an immediate growth plan for servicing untapped vendor management needs.
