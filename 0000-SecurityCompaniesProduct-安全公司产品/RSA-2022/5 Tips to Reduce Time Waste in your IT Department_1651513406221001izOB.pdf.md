MAKE INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE
The first key to efficiency for any successful business is to ensure access to information. You need to be able to provide:
EMPLOYEES WITH SECURE & CONSISTENT ACCESS TO INFORMATION
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN EMPLOYEES SPEND ROUGHLY 20% OF THEIR DAY SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION.

YOUR TEAM
It is essential that your staff can access information to help support your organization. You need to consider how you as a business will allow information to be stored and shared amongst your team. When information is accessible by all, it doesn't matter if someone on your team is away. You'll be able to pick up where they left off.
Automate documentation of endpoint data, passwords, and warranty information
Document your standard operating procedures to ensure process consistency
Structured, centralized documentation, with intuitive links between information
No compromises on security

YOUR BOSSES

STANDARDIZE YOUR PROCESSES

No matter what sized team you have, you will find that creating business processes that are efficient is becoming increasingly important for success.
There is an ever-increasing drive to automate processes where possible. The key to efficiency is to standardize procedures across your entire department. For example, standardize the way you monitor networks and manage employee devices with your RMM tool. This can be done by creating a Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for your team to help them follow the same procedure every time they set up a new employee.

Process needs to become part of your core requirements of your staff. Make it a rule for your team to follow and document your processes. Chaos shouldn't run the department-- process should.

REDUCE

ONBOARDING

TIME

Onboarding staff can be a large source of cost waste for any organization. Think about the amount of time it took you to get your last hire productive and and creating value.

The key here is to document, both your internal procedures and your company environment. New staff no longer have to be mind readers!

If you want new staff to do things in the most efficient way, every time, and the way you prefer, write it down exactly how you want it done.

Then make that information easily accessible to anyone on the team. The key is that the process is written in a way that any employee can follow it. Determine the optimal time for completing a task, then measure how close your team is to meeting this standard. You can then start looking at ways where time waste can be eliminated to reach this optimal time.
Through documentation more routine tasks can be passed on to less expensive or skilled staff members for completion. It also means that you'll have greater visibility into team member roles, so even if someone's out of the office, it's easy to step in and fill the gap. Information doesn't walk out the door with them, and day-to-day operations are not hindered by their absence.
