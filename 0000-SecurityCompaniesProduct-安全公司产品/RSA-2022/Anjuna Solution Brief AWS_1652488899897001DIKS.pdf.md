Private Computing on AWS:
 Harden Your Cloud workloads
Making the Move From On-Premises to AWS  

Many businesses are driving hard to use cloud computing--and for good reasons. AWS provides scalability, ease-of-consumption, and cost benefits unrivaled by on-premises data centers. But what's holding enterprises back from fully embracing the cloud? 
 Security risk concerns like data exposure to insiders, third parties, bad actors, and malicious software--in addition to IT operations teams are top of mind. Keeping data secure meant maintaining data in an expensive private data center, which is why organizations have struggled to move critical workloads to AWS.
