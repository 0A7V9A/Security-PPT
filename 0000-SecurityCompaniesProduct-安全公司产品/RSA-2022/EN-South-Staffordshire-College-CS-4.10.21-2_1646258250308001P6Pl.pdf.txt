Results
Strengthening of password policy after Pentera detected a group password policy that was not applied to the right container, resulting in weak passwords
Clear value reporting when communicating to the Board of Directors through a dashboard and security resilience score
Daily or On-Demand penetration tests providing consistent security validation during network changes
Team independence and increased efficiency through remediation prioritization based on the proven attack vectors

Jason Whitaker IT DIrector, South Staffordshire College
"Pentera is like a trusted friend that highlights all the security issues and then categorizes and prioritizes them for us."

Challenges Prior to Pentera
1 Security Blindspots Due to Sparse Penetration Testing The technological transit the organization was advancing required continuous validation that the changes made in the network were not compromising its security resilience, which was not attainable with an annual pen test.
2 Disordered Patching and Remediation Practices The IT team spent many weeks remediating vulnerabilities, which, in retrospect, were not deemed critical. A clear prioritization and kill-chain categorization were needed to focus the team and save time.
3 Small Team with Multiple Responsibilities The lean IT team required tools and automation to complement their resources and knowledge. An annual penetration test rendered them without an available security validation toolkit for the rest of the year.
Background
South Staffordshire College was undertaking a significant IT and cybersecurity transition. This included personnel changes, upgrading tools and systems to top tier technologies, and changing the resource allocation strategy and security planning. The team realized that their annual pen testing practice provided a very limited and insufficient view of the IT network environment, leaving them uninformed about the state of their network. In addition, while Pre-COVID changes had enabled them to stay afloat, the team was kept very busy and required automated validation they could "fire and forget", yet trust.
I would remove other tools out of my toolset to pay for Pentera. We run an annual pentest, and would need at least 4-5 of them for peace of mind. Pentera runs daily, so the savings are unparalleled to any security platform.

Long Term Benefits
Had we implemented Pentera 18 months earlier, we would have saved months of misplaced resources.
Real Time Security Validation
With Pentera, South Staffordshire College is able to run penetration tests with a click of a button. Reviewing the effect of the changes as they are implemented prevents negative consequences, unlike with annual penetration tests.
Maximized Team Efficiency
Pentera focuses the team on threat-facing vulnerabilities and prioritizes remediation accurately which saves time. Once Pentera detects an issue, the team turns it into a ticket and the infrastructure manager works on it. In addition, a weekly patching schedule takes place by using Ivanti Patch Management based on Pentera's results.
Clear Tracking Over Time
The Pentera report provides a clear dashboard presented monthly to the Board of Directors with a security resilience score that is monitored over time. The IT team has visibility to the number of discovered devices, total vulnerabilities, the ratio of critical-breachable vulnerabilities, passwords that have been cracked, open shares, anonymous access, and more.
Optimization of the Cyber Security Toolkit
Pentera allows the college to optimize the usage of existing security tools integrated with the SIEM such as Darktrace and F-Secure Radar, by showing where the security controls are effective and integrated well and where there are gaps in policy or configuration.
The cyber technologies we invested in this year, including Pentera, have been key to our cyber advancement and therefore to our business stability.

Conclusion
The South Staffordshire College's IT department has established itself as the technological forefront in security technologies and in dealing with security risk. The team has come to rely on Pentera's information, prioritization, reporting and simplicity on a daily basis. The team validates security, without having to be experts on a wide set of tools. The clear reporting, straightforward documentation, quick implementation and amicable personal support have turned Pentera into a key tool in the team's work methodology and day to day.
