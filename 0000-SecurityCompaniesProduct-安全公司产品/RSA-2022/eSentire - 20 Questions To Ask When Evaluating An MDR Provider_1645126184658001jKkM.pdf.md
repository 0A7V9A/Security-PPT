20 Questions To Ask When You're Evaluating an MDR Provider
Discerning fact from fiction in a confusing marketplace
In the latest Managed Detection and Response (MDR) market guide, Gartner estimates there are now over two hundred organizations delivering MDR services globally.
Emerging from the traditional Managed Security Services Provider model in the early 2010s, MDR represented a tectonic shift from an alert-driven to response-driven service model. Acknowledging that attackers were not only increasing in sophistication but in the speed with which they could accomplish their objectives, MDR sought to help under-resourced security teams identify advanced threat actors and stop them before they could cause irreparable damage.
Security leaders are increasingly cognizant that reducing the time to detect a threat is meaningless without a corresponding reduction in the time to respond to a threat to enable a return to a known good state.
- Gartner 2021

Fast forwarding to the present day, the need for MDR services has exploded as organizations continue to be under-resourced while struggling to protect a growing attack surface.
While MDR growth has been good for the evolution of cyber security, the increasing number of organizations jumping on the MDR bandwagon has led to confusion and risk for unsuspecting buyers. Recognizing lucrative opportunities in the MDR market space, MSSPs adjusted their marketing with clever claims that masquerade traditional alert-based services as MDR. In addition, the growing varieties of true MDR providers has led many organizations to ask themselves:

Variations of EDR, NDR,
SIEM, ect.

Managed EDR

MDR Market

MSSPs

"What is MDR and how do I select the right provider for my organization?"

Managed NDR
Managed SIEM
Managed XDR

As the market continues to take shape, five recurring and measurable components have emerged that are applicable to the challenges Managed Detection and Response Services address:

Managed Detection and Response

How does the provider identify risk, improve resiliency and optimize MDR accordingly?
How does the provider alleviate complexity and resource constraints?
How does the provider integrate with existing and future environments and what can they see?

These questions, aligned to macro level outcomes, are applicable to any MDR provider regardless of the variation of MDR they deliver.
We recommend supporting these questions with the critical follow ups outlined below to ensure any MDR provider you are evaluating can produce the outcomes your organization is looking to achieve.
The 20 questions here should serve to qualify or disqualify a potential vendor from consideration in relation to their ability to deliver against your unique Managed Detection and Response requirements:

Question
Can you test the efficacy of my current defenses?
Can you systematically identify risk?
Can you operationalize MDR contextual to that risk?
Can you measure the efficacy of MDR and optimize against my business changes?

Expected Outcomes
Identifies gaps in prevention and detection capabilities before attacks do
Identifies systemic weaknesses and roadmaps improvements that harden your security program over time
Implements MDR against your identified areas of greatest risk, not just blindly placing MDR anywhere across your environment
Ensures services deliver on targeted outcomes and adapts protections that keep pace with your business requirements

Question
How are customers able to derive insights from the MDR service?
To what degree are insights able to convey value from the MDR service?
How do you comprehensively conduct reactive threat hunting?
How do you proactively hunt threats across the customer's environment?

Expected Outcomes

While these questions do not cover every facet of consideration for MDR vendors, they should provide the basis for desired outcomes and critical criteria for vendors that could meet your specific requirements. Organizations considering a Managed Detection and Response provider are encouraged to ask for customer references, visit in person or participate in virtual Security Operations Center tours, participate in demonstrations of delivery in real-world scenarios and poll peers as well as industry analysts for experiences with vendor satisfaction.
