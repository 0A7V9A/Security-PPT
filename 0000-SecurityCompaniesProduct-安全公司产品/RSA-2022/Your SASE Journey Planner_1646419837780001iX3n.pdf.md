YOUR SASE JOURNEY PLANNER
Before you set out on any journey, you need to think about where you're heading, what you'll face along the way, and what to take with you. Use this checklist to help you know which questions to ask and the considerations to keep in mind as you embark on your journey to a SASE architecture.
Milestones and Expectations
Where do I want to be at the end of this journey? What are the goals for this transformation? What is my expected end result - fully in the cloud or a hybrid environment? What outcome objectives am I looking to achieve? Is my timeline realistic, given that shifting to a SASE architecture can take years, not months? What milestones do I want to establish?
Current Investments
Which applications have to stay in the data center? What can move to the cloud? What about my current services plan? Do I have any existing equipment I can reuse for SASE? Do I have clear visibility into what's happening on the network? What tools do I need to achieve this? How do I secure my data center, and where do protections live?
Architecture, Appliances, Site Locations
What is the desired service experience for: corporate and remote sites, remote and roaming users, business partners, corporate governance, and WAN topologies? Do sites need to talk to one another? Am I keeping my existing WAN topology? Will I include SD-WAN? What am I looking to migrate in both the short-term and long-term? Do I know which appliances will be used on the network and what needs to be secured? What operational activities am I looking to automate? Can my team manage these activities from a single console? What legacy applications do I have, and where? Can they be migrated to the cloud? Do they need to stay on-premises? How many sites am I looking to connect? How many can I support? Will it be phased? Do I have an order to deploy these technologies? Applications? Services? What regulatory/industry requirements must I observe? What does it take to bring a new site online?
Identity
Do I have an identity access management (IAM) solution? Should I look at a new IAM solution as part of the transition? How will the identity and overall reputation of the user and/or device factor into its access permissions? How am I going to identify the user; and what if it is an IOT device? Is multi-factor authentication something I should consider?
Implementation and Procurement
Do I procure technology alone? What about a managed technology? How much as-a-service can I handle? Is the vendor securing SASE for me, or am I securing the whole offer? Do I have clear timelines for my organization and the vendor? Which teams will this roll out to first? For apps in the data center, what can I support?

People
How can I prepare my team for this transition? Will it be a dedicated team, or will the Ops team handle it?
How do I plan to operationalize SASE?
What are the basic workflows that I need to consider: delivering a new service, configuring a user device, securing a session?
How will SASE impact my security workflow?
How is my operations team going to handle policy synchronization on-premises or in the cloud?
Who will carry out service definition, negotiation, and evaluation?
Who will manage it over the short and long term?

Budget
Have I outlined the needs of each stakeholder?
Does the vendor address these needs, and does extra budget need to be allocated?
Do I understand my CapEX and OpEX?
Am I going to support this internally, or do I need professional services?
Are there enough qualified people in professional services to handle this?

Future Considerations
How do I deal with the transitional state as we move to SASE? Where will my applications be in 24-60 months? Where will the inspection for that traffic be? What is my future investment strategy?
