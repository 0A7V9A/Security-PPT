THE PROBLEM

Your enterprise phone system, or voice network, has become a focus for cyber criminals.

And while most organizations have hardened their technical infrastructure, the inbound and outbound calls (voice traffic) that traverse this infrastructure are largely unchecked.

Did you know that 95% of cyber security breaches are caused by human error?
The bad guys know it.
They also know that if you want to stay in business and deliver exceptional customer service, customer support and a world-class user experience, you must answer the phone.

Multi-Layered
Protection

The majority of cyber attacks begin when bad actors infiltrate your organization and extract data and information bit by bit.
Cyber criminals are organized and professional. They work methodically to gather the human connections, good will and credentials that empower any number of attacks including ransomware, TDoS, theft and fraud. Leveraging the phone, they have an open conduit into your organization and directly to your people.
