KEY BENEFITS
9 Accelerate value from Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR on day one
9 Extend your team with threat detection and response expertise
9 Reduce risk acceptance
9 Speed up investigation and response in one portal
9 Reduce attacker dwell time
9 Triage and contain alerts from anywhere with MOBILESOCTM

MDR up leveled. XDR go beyond. An integrated threat detection and response solution for unrivaled security and operational efficiency that's more than good, it's better.
We do what others don't. The CRITICALSTART Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service integration with Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDRTM delivers a comprehensive combination of experienced analysts and operational process that helps your security team to quickly detect, investigate and respond to every alert, and stop the most advanced attacks while reducing risk, alert fatigue, and analyst burnout. Plus, by simply augmenting in-house security protocols with MDR security experts, the painstaking process of building or refining your own security operations center (SOC) is eliminated.

Why CRITICALSTART Resolving alerts is good. Resolving all alerts is better.
9 Our trust-oriented approach leverages the power of the Zero Trust Analytics Platform (ZTAP) and Trusted Behavior Registry (TBR) to address all alerts
9 We auto-resolve more than 99% of alerts
9 We escalate less than 0.1% of alerts ­ the alerts that really require the attention of your security team

By ingesting Cortex XDR endpoint, network, and cloud data into ZTAP, the TBR quickly establishes what data is a trigger event and what information in the alert is an observation.

Simplify security operations to stay ahead of attackers.

How we do it

We take every alert from Cortex XDR into ZTAP and match it against known good patterns in the TBR. If there is a match, the

alert is automatically resolved and incorporated into the TBR. BIf uthielrte-isnntoramnastcph,atrhenCcRIyTICALSTART Security Operations
