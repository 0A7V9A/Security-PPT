CASE STUDY
Managed Detection and Response Provided by Secureworks® TaegisTM ManagedXDR
With Secureworks as their security partner, GKN Wheels and Structures was able to answer the question, "What if we were attacked?" The company was able to see clear and concise data relating to their security and make informed and proactive decisions for the business.
Overview:
GKN Wheels & Structures is a manufacturer of wheels for the off-highway (Agriculture, Construction, Material Handling, Forestry, and Mining) and structural assemblies for the automotive market. GKN Wheels has manufacturing facilities located in the UK, USA, and Denmark, with R&D Centers in Italy and the USA. GKN Wheels & Structures manufactures and tests in the UK. The major concern for Faisal Jaffri, Global IT Director, GKN Wheels & Structures, and his team was that they were a small team protecting the organization's security posture, with limited to no visibility of security threats headed their way or a timely way to deal with them should they occur. The team was reliant on third-party support, which in some cases could take 72 hours for a response or resolution. GKN Wheels & Structures executives had confidence in the team's overall ability, but expanding their skillsets or adding new team members were not feasible options.

Business Need GKN Wheels & Structures sought a security partner that could work as an extension of their IT team, and to support them 24x7 in identifying and actioning against security events in a timely and effective manner. They were unable to do this themselves with the current bandwidth and skillset of the current in-house team. They sought a solution that combined security analytics with SecOps expertise.
Challenge: GKN Wheels & Structures relied on a small global team to respond to security threats: 10 internal IT employees and third parties, no security specialists, and no 24x7 protection
Solution: TaegisTM ManagedXDR provides GKN Wheels & Structures the security partnership they need, with 24x7 monitoring and a clear dashboard providing evidence of events, alerts, and investigations.

This led Faisal to wonder about short-term and long-term security management. He went to market for a managed solution as opposed to a technical platform, looking for an extension of his internal team to protect against and monitor for security threats.
`What if?'
GKN Wheels & Structures had in place Check Point firewalls, Microsoft Defender, and was using Symantec WSS service for web filtering. Before going to tender and implementing TaegisTM ManagedXDR, Faisal's concern was the "what if." GKN Wheels & Structures lacked a readily available view of threats and the ability to take action. As topics such as ransomware became a hot topic for many within the business, due to an increase in news reports of attacks across the globe, Faisal "was kept awake at night wondering how we would address a security incident if it were to happen."
How has TaegisTM ManagedXDR helped to strengthen your security?
24x7 proactive monitoring has given GKN Wheels & Structures a clear and confident view of security events, and the ability to deal with them in a timely manner.
"The day we went live, I received a call regarding some suspicious activity. Upon investigation it turned out to be authorized activity by a member of our IT team in an overseas site. In the past, activity like this would never have been identified or reported, so it was reassuring that ManagedXDR flagged it and raised the appropriate questions. This gave me peace of mind and the feeling that our security culture was moving in the right direction. We now think about the actions we take internally and understand the potential risks they pose to our overall security." Faisal Jaffri, Global IT Director
With ManagedXDR, the Secureworks team takes immediate action to triage and escalates dependent on the priority. The GKN Wheels & Structures team then investigates the root

"We had no systems in place that collected or collated information. With the TaegisTM ManagedXDR dashboard, I can easily see the number of alerts and investigations, which gives me a clear view of what is going on and enables me to manage and allocate resources appropriately."

cause and provides feedback to the Secureworks team. The ManagedXDR dashboard and mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework gives valuable insight into types of attacks, and enables Faisal and his team to focus proactively on prevention vs. protection activities.
Implementation and reporting
"Implementation was painless." Faisal Jaffri, Global IT Director, GKN Wheels & Structures.
Faisal and his IT team are now able to do more than measure progress of security and IT. With the ManagedXDR dashboard giving them full visibility of events and activity, the team has clear data that shows threats are constant. This informs and educates the business and its executive leadership team that security is an ongoing, ever-evolving task that requires constant management. Threat actors are constantly working, but with ManagedXDR in place, GKN Wheels & Structures is able to constantly and effectively work against mitigating security risk to their business.

"I was kept awake at night wondering how we would address a security incident if it were to happen. We had a strong approach to security practices and the business's leadership team had confidence in us as a team, but we had no way of dealing with incidents in a timely manner. The partnership with Secureworks and the TaegisTM ManagedXDR service removes this concern."
Dr. Faisal Jaffri Global IT Director, GKN Wheels & Structures
