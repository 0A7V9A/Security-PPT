2021 STATE OF
INDUSTRIAL CYBERSECURITY
The Risks Created by the Cultural Divide Between IT & OT Teams

The 2021 State of Industrial Cybersecurity The Risks Created by the Cultural Divide Between the IT & OT Teams
Presented by Ponemon Institute, November 2021
Part 1. Executive Summary
A primary challenge to improving the security of organizations' Industrial Control System (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) environments, as revealed in this research, is the need to overcome the cultural and technical differences between OT and IT teams. Ideally, organizations should work toward establishing a unified IT and OT approach to addressing the threats and closing the gaps in security that leave organizations vulnerable to cyber attackers. Sponsored by Dragos, Ponemon Institute surveyed 603 IT, IT security and OT security practitioners at the Clevel, managerial and director level in the United States. All are familiar with cybersecurity initiatives and ICS and OT security practices within their organizations.
In the context of this research, OT represents the programmable systems or devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building management systems, safety control systems, and physical access control mechanisms.
ICS encompasses several types of control systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system components such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures. An ICS consists of combinations of control components that act together to achieve an industrial objective.
The cultural divide between IT and OT teams affects the ability to secure both the IT and the ICS/OT environment. According to Figure 1, because of the lack of alignment between an organization's cybersecurity policies and procedures with OT and ICS security objectives, only 35 percent of respondents say their IT and OT teams have a unified security strategy that secures both the IT and OT environments, despite the need for different controls and priorities. Only 39 percent of respondents say IT and OT teams work cohesively to achieve a mature security posture in both the IT and OT environments.

The risks created by the cultural divide between the IT & OT Teams
 Fifty percent of respondents are optimistic about the future of their ICS/OT cybersecurity program. However, only 21 percent of respondents say their ICS/OT program activities have achieved full maturity and emerging threats drive priority actions. A fully mature program also means C-level executives and the board of directors are regularly informed about the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of the program. Twenty-nine percent of respondents say their organizations are in the late-middle stage which means C-level support, adequate budget, risk assessment and a cross-functional team of IT and OT SMEs work together cohesively.
 As the frequency and severity of attacks increase, organizations are struggling to keep ahead of these threats. Sixty-three percent of respondents say their organizations had an ICS/OT cybersecurity incident in the past two years.
 For the first time, this research calculates the cost of one cybersecurity incident in the ICS/OT environment. The average cost per cybersecurity incident is $2,989,550 (the calculation is shown in Table 1 of this report). An average of 316 days is spent to detect, investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident. Based on the use of a threat hunting and incident response team that averages six IT and IT security personnel, it costs an average of $963,168 to detect, investigate and remediate the incident. The fixed costs including the replacement of equipment, downtime, legal and regulatory fines total $2,026,382. This equals the average total cost of $2,989,550.
 The majority of respondents say senior management lacks an understanding about the cyber risks in the ICS/OT environments. As a result, not enough resources are allocated to defend the ICS/OT environments. Paradoxically, according to 56 percent of respondents, the primary blocker for investing in ICS/OT cybersecurity is that ICS/OT cybersecurity is managed by the engineering department, which does not have security expertise followed by 53 percent of respondents who say ICS/OT security is managed by an IT department without engineering expertise.
 The Director/Manager of IT and the VP of Engineering are the functions most respondents in this study report to. However, by far the VP of Engineering is most accountable for the security of the ICS/OT program. Only 12 percent of respondents say the CISO is most accountable for the security of ICS/OT program. Further, only 35 percent of respondents say someone responsible for ICS and OT cybersecurity reports IT and cybersecurity initiatives to the board of directors. Of these respondents, 41 percent say such reporting takes place only when a security incident occurs.
 Only 38 percent of respondents say the security safeguards in place to protect the ICS and OT environments are covered during board meetings and only 36 percent of respondents say the effectiveness and efficiency of security programs and measures are presented.
 Cultural and technical differences must be overcome to have OT and IT teams work cohesively. The challenges often are not caused by a competition for budget dollars and new security projects (only 32 percent of respondents). Rather, it is the cultural and technical differences between traditional IT-specific best practices and what is possible in OT environments, such as patch management and unique requirements of industrial automation equipment vendors that cause conflicts between these two functions (50 percent and 44 percent of respondents, respectively).
 Only 46 percent of respondents say their organizations are effective in gathering intelligence about threats to the ICS/OT environment and 45 percent of respondents say their organizations are effective in discovering and maintaining an inventory of all devices attached anywhere on the OT network throughout the asset lifecycle.

Part 2. Key findings

In this section of the report, we provide an analysis of the research. The complete findings are presented in the Appendix of the report. We have organized the report according to the following topics.

 The level of cybersecurity maturity for ICS/OT  What does the organization have in place to secure the ICS/OT?  OT cybersecurity investment, priorities and accountability  The cause and consequences of an ICS and OT ransomware and cybersecurity incident

The level of cybersecurity maturity for ICS/OT

Fifty percent of respondents say their ICS and OT program activities are mature or in the late middle stage. In the context of this research, the four phases of maturity are described below. According to Figure 2, 50 percent of respondents say their organizations are stalled in the early (17 percent) or middle stage (33 percent), which means ICS and OT program activities have not been planned or deployed or only partially deployed. Only 21 percent of respondents say program activities are fully deployed and senior leadership is regularly informed about the efficiency, effectiveness and security of the program. Twenty-nine percent of respondents say their organizations are in the late-middle stage which means C-level support, adequate budget, risk assessment and a cross-functional team of IT and OT SMEs work together cohesively.

Early stage: Many ICS and OT program activities have not as yet been planned or deployed. Response to threats is reactive and ad hoc. Resources are not sufficient for staffing and
investment in the program. Middle stage: ICS and OT program activities are planned and defined but only partially deployed. Efforts are being made to establish security protocols, develop a workforce of SMEs,
prioritize risks, increase investments, and take steps to have IT and OT work cohesively. Late-middle stage: ICS and OT programs have C-level support and adequate budget. Risks are regularly assessed, and a cross-functional team of IT and OT SMEs work together cohesively.
Mature stage: ICS and OT program activities are fully deployed at target maturity states, emerging threats drive priority actions, and C-level executives and the board of directors are
regularly informed about the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of the program.

Cultural and technical differences must be overcome to have OT and IT work cohesively. The challenges of working cohesively often are not caused by a competition for budget dollars and new security projects (only 32 percent of respondents). Rather, it is the cultural and technical differences between traditional IT-specific best practices and what is possible in OT environments, such as patch management and unique requirements of industrial automation equipment vendors that cause conflicts between these two functions (50 percent and 44 percent of respondents, respectively), as shown in Figure 3. Also contributing to the cultural divide is the finding that 43 percent of respondents say there is a lack of clear "ownership" on industrial cyber risk and uncertainty around who leads the initiative, implements the controls and supports the program.

Many senior managers lack awareness of the risks and threats to the OT and ICS environments. As a result, resources to manage these risks are often inadequate. Less than half (48 percent) of respondents say their organizations understand the unique cyber risks and has specific security processes and policies for OT and ICS environments. Only 43 percent of respondents say senior management understands the cyber risks and provides enough resources to defend OT and ICS environments, according to Figure 7.

What does the organization have in place to secure the ICS/OT?
As the frequency and severity of attacks increase, organizations are struggling to keep ahead of these threats. Respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of their intelligence gathering practices to understand threats to the ICS and OT environment, on a scale of 1 = not effective to 10 = highly effective.
As shown in Figure 8, only 46 percent of respondents say their organizations are very effective in gathering intelligence about threats to the ICS and OT. Only 45 percent of respondents say their organizations are very effective in the ability to discover and maintain an inventory of all devices attached anywhere in the OT network throughout the asset lifecycle.

Business continuity and compliance risk from industry standards/regulations have financial consequences and are the top cybersecurity risks for organizations. According to Figure 9, only 35 percent of respondents say vulnerable equipment in OT networks is considered a top cybersecurity risk. Business continuity and interruption (44 percent of respondents) and compliance risk from industry standards/regulations (42 percent of respondents) are considered a cybersecurity risk. Only 28 percent of respondents say the increased attack surface with connectivity into the OT environment is a top cybersecurity risk.

Accountability for the security of the ICS and OT environments is most often assigned to the VP of engineering and this function is most often considered a deterrent to investing in OT and ICS as shown in Figure 13. Fifty-six percent of respondents say the reason for blocking investments is that OT security is managed by the engineering department which does
not have security expertise and 53 percent of respondents say OT security is managed by an IT
department without engineering expertise.

The cause and consequence of an ICS and OT ransomware and cybersecurity incident
In the context of this research, ransomware is a sophisticated piece of malware that blocks the victim's access to files. While there are many strains of ransomware, they generally fall into two categories:
Crypto ransomware encrypts files on a computer or mobile device making them unstable. Crypto ransomware essentially takes the files hostage, demanding a ransom in exchange for the decryption key needed to restore the files. Locker ransomware is a virus that blocks basic computer functions, essentially locking the victim out of their data and files located on the infected device. Instead of targeting files with encryption, cybercriminals demand a ransom to unlock the device.
A cybersecurity incident is defined as a violation or imminent threat or violation of computer and document security policies, acceptable use policies or standard security practices. An incident can involve the theft or misuse of both electronic/digital and paper documents that contain sensitive or confidential information.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents say their organization experienced a ransomware attack in the past two years. Of these respondents, 51 percent say their organizations paid an average ransom of more than $500,000.
Negligent insiders are most likely to cause a cybersecurity incident. Sixty-three percent of respondents say their organizations experienced an ICS/OT cybersecurity incident. Of these respondents, 47 percent of respondents say it was caused by a negligent insider followed by 41 percent of respondents who say it was a maintenance event or related issue, as shown in Figure 15.

Table 1 shows the average time and cost to detect, investigate and remediate a cybersecurity incident in the ICS and OT environment. As discussed, 63 percent of respondents experienced an ICS/OT cybersecurity incident in the past two years. The average
cost per cybersecurity incident for organizations represented in this research is $2,989,550.

As shown in the table, an average of 316 days is spent to detect, investigate and remediate the
cybersecurity incident. Based on the use of a threat hunting and incident response team that averages six IT and IT security personnel, it costs an average of $963,168 to detect, investigate and remediate the incident. The fixed costs for the cybersecurity incident including the
replacement of equipment, downtime, legal and regulatory fines total $2,026,382. This equals the average total cost of $2,989,550.

Based on the research, organizations can strengthen the cybersecurity posture of their ICS and OT environments by bridging the IT and OT cultural divide.

 Create cross-functional teams of IT and OT SMES to bridge the cultural divide. While there is a need for different controls and priorities, organizations should have a unified security strategy that secures both the IT and OT environments.
 A priority of these cross-functional teams should be to inform C-level executives and the board of directors about the efficiency, effectiveness and security of the ICS/OT cybersecurity program.
 According to the research, most organizations do not have regular meetings with the board to discuss such important topics as the security safeguards in place to protect the ICS and OT environments, the impact to the bottom line a cybersecurity incident would have and what practices are in place to protect the organization's OT infrastructure, high value assets and intellectual property.
 The cross-functional teams should also create an incident response plan for responding to a cybersecurity incident and review the plan on a regular basis.
 Ensure there is enough budget and personnel to be able improve the ability to discover and maintain an inventory of all devices attached anywhere on the OT network throughout the asset lifecycle.

Other recommendations include the following
Because of the unique nature of OT security, an industrial cybersecurity program can't be a copyand-paste of the IT cybersecurity program. ICS environments need cybersecurity strategies and tools tailored specifically to the different missions, challenges and threats faced by industrial organizations.
Make an OT Cybersecurity Roadmap: Effective industrial cybersecurity programs tend to be driven by threats and consequences to OT assets--prioritized by the business value of the asset and the likelihood of a given attack scenario.
Ideally, an organization should be able to gain visibility, control and minimum cybersecurity hygiene across the entire OT environment, but that takes time and money. In order to develop a solid cybersecurity roadmap that can incrementally phase in good cybersecurity practices, organizations should start first with a discovery process that gathers input from the board, executive stakeholders, and asset owners on the highest business priorities tied to OT processes and then survey the environment to understand all the OT assets in place and the priorities. The team then identifies and ranks the OT assets involved, based on business importance. From there the team should chart out the threat-driven and consequence-driven scenarios most likely to impact high-priority assets. The scenarios are defined as follows:
 Threat driven: These scenarios are those which threat intelligence reports have shown to impact organizations.
 Consequence driven: These scenarios are constructed by moving backwards from worst consequences of an attack that you would want to avoid in high-priority ICS environments and sketching out the common attack techniques that could be used to trigger them.
With these scenarios in mind, the team should examine existing controls and how they stack up against the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers in each situation. Use this to identify gaps compared to an ideal set of controls and this provides the basis for setting out a roadmap. Don't try to boil the ocean, break it down into a multi-year plan for continuous improvement, prioritizing coverage and speed of investment based on that asset ranking gleaned from the stakeholders.
Get the Right Tools: Many IT detection and monitoring tools don't translate well to ICS environments. Often IT detection tools simply don't interface well with OT systems or are impractical when placed within an ICS environment. For example, endpoint protection won't work for PLCs.
What's more, the detection mechanisms and output are all based on IT-focused threats, so the context and correlation of what matters to OT operators will be missing. The machine learning models are not useful in ICS environments since they were designed and tuned for IT. Dragos experts are repeatedly called to incidents where they've found that Windows AV destroyed ICS applications because they looked odd to heuristics engines unaccustomed to the way ICS functions operate.
This is why an organization will need OT-specific cybersecurity tooling that can support the management of risks that matter most in industrial settings.

Skill Up: OT cybersecurity is a specialized endeavor. While the enterprise cybersecurity team may be able to take the lead on strategic planning--with heavy OT stakeholder collaboration-- and even shoulder some of the day-to-day work, the team will need additional resources to execute on a plan. For many organizations, the best way to quickly build up the requisite skills will be by leveraging partners and third parties to bridge internal gaps, for example by putting a firm on retainer for rapid incident response.
The conversation should be `We've all bought into this together.' You tie it to the business problem. Instead of it being some ephemeral problem, it's based on real scenarios that either the threats have shown you or your people are concerned about, and so you're able to present real information to the executives.

Part 3. Methodology
A sampling frame of 17,040 IT, IT security and OT security practitioners at the C-level, managerial and director level in the United States were selected as participants to this survey. All respondents are familiar with their organizations' cybersecurity initiatives and ICS and OT security. Table 2 shows 673 total returns.

Part 4. Caveats to this study
There are inherent limitations to survey research that need to be carefully considered before drawing inferences from findings. The following items are specific limitations that are germane to most web-based surveys.
 Non-response bias: The current findings are based on a sample of survey returns. We sent surveys to a representative sample of individuals, resulting in a large number of usable returned responses. Despite non-response tests, it is always possible that individuals who did not participate are substantially different in terms of underlying beliefs from those who completed the instrument.
 Sampling-frame bias: The accuracy is based on contact information and the degree to which the list is representative of individuals who are IT, IT security and OT security practitioners. We also acknowledge that the results may be biased by external events such as media coverage. Finally, because we used a web-based collection method, it is possible that nonweb responses by mailed survey or telephone call would result in a different pattern of findings.
 Self-reported results: The quality of survey research is based on the integrity of confidential responses received from subjects. While certain checks and balances can be incorporated into the survey process, there is always the possibility that a subject did not provide accurate responses.

Part 3. Maturity of the OT and ICS cybersecurity program
Q13. What best describes the maturity of your organization's ICS/OT cybersecurity program?
Early stage: Many ICS and OT program activities have not as yet been planned or deployed. Response to threats is reactive and ad hoc. Resources are not sufficient for staffing and investment in the program.
Middle stage: ICS and OT program activities are planned and defined but only partially deployed. Efforts are being made to establish security protocols, develop a workforce of SMEs, prioritize risks, increase investments, and take steps to have IT and OT work cohesively.
Late-middle stage: ICS and OT program has C-level support and adequate budget. Risks are regularly assessed, and a cross-functional team of IT and OT SMEs work together cohesively.
Mature stage: ICS and OT program activities are fully deployed at target maturity states, emerging threats drive priority actions, and C-level executives and the board of directors are regularly informed about the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of the program.
