"We've got a wealth of tools in our Microsoft stack and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. By evangelizing those possibilities throughout the organization with seamless security, we make their lives easier--and enhance patient care."
--Keith Blanchard, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Amedisys

Situation:
Leading home healthcare and hospice company Amedisys is adamant that excellent patient care comes before back-office procedures, including data security policies. How could it protect patient data while also making it easy for 21,000 remote clinicians to access?

Solution:

Impact:

Amedisys deployed the full Microsoft 365 stack--productivity apps and Microsoft Security solutions. It manages a diverse ecosystem of devices and applications with Endpoint Manager, boosting usability with a password-free solution and Microsoft 365 compliance center.

The company saves time and money with a fully interconnected productivity stack that takes on much of the security burden--so users don't have to. Clinicians focus on their patients, not passwords, to access the systems they need to deliver the best care.
