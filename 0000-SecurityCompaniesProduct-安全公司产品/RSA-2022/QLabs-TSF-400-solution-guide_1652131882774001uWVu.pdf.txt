All-In-One Data Security with the Trusted Security Foundation® Key and Policy Manager
Encryption and encryption key management are fundamental to strong data security. QuintessenceLabs' TSF 400 key and policy manager delivers the best encryption key and policy management capabilities allowing you to keep your data safe, today and into the future.
With the TSF line of key and policy management devices, enterprises can seamlessly implement the strongest cybersecurity and focus on growing their business.
Integration That Matters QuintessenceLabs uniquely offers a truly integrated, highly secure one-device solution in the Trusted Security Foundation® (TSF®) key and policy manager appliance. The TSF key and policy manager combines vendor-neutral key and policy management with an embedded HSM, all backed by quantum-powered randomness to protect against the most advanced cyberattacks. This results in an easily deployable, high performing, data protection capability -- our Trusted Security Foundation -- allowing you to focus on what your organization does best.
Centralized Security with the TSF Key and Policy Manager The TSF appliance delivers a very comprehensive key and policy management solution. At its core is the TSF key and policy manager, which handles large numbers of cryptographic keys and their policies. It also includes the qStreamTM quantum random number generator (QRNG) appliance, which provides true random numbers for use as encryption keys or other cryptographic parameters, at very high throughputs. The third element is a hardware security module (HSM), a physically secure device that further protects the data moving through the security infrastructure. The rack-mounted TSF key and policy manager appliance is easily integrated into your IT infrastructure, providing high-availability protection and management of cryptographic keys.

Embedded HSM An embeded HSM is a physical device providing an isolated, protected environment for securely handling encryption keys or other sensitive cryptographic material, and performing cryptographic operations such as encryption and digital signing. HSMs that are validated to meet the requirements of FIPS 140-2 Level 3 are tamper resistant, and will destroy (or "zeroize") cryptographic material if an attempt is made to breach the device's security boundary. Powerful Key Management As enterprise data is processed and encrypted, the keys to decrypt that data need to be managed and stored throughout their lifetime, and policies need to be implemented to ensure secure and streamlined operations and access to the protected information. Critical features of a secure key management system include separation of duties, key lifecycle management, "m-of-n" quorum rules, consistent and available key management services, effective access and user policy enforcement, among others. The TSF key and policy manager is a vendor-neutral platform designed to simplify integration with new and legacy systems, and conforms to the OASIS Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), a standard specifying interoperability between key management clients and servers. The TSF key and policy manager appliance is regularly tested for interoperability with other vendors' KMIP implementations, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the OASIS KMIP Interoperability Subcommittee. For additional information on key management challenges and how the TSF key and policy manner addresses them, see the our "Key Management Best Practices" white paper or visit quintesencelabs.com.

Quantum Random Number Generation Generating strong cryptographic keys is crucial when encrypting data, and this relies on the quality of the random numbers used. Deterministic, algorithm-based methods of generating randomness may introduce security vulnerabilities. QuintessenceLabs' qStreamTM quantum random number generator (QRNG) generates the highest quality random numbers at high rates by measuring a truly random quantum phenomenon: quantum tunneling. The TSF key and policy manager integrates the qStream QRNG, giving access to the highest quality random numbers for the generation of keys or other cryptographic objects at rates up to 1bit/sec.
QuintessenceLabs' qStream QRNG Appliance
Embedded qStream QRNG features: · QRNG PCIe card delivering true random numbers · 1Gbit/sec uniformly distributed true random number output · Conforms with NIST SP 800-90A, B (draft) and C (draft) · Each user's output is 100% independent; traceability · Fully independent output for each user, full audit trail from hardware to consumer
Where Integrated Devices Excel Simple Setup - For enterprises, data centers, and other large businesses, installing new hardware can be complex, time consuming and costly. The TSF key and policy manager delivers enhanced security that is interoperable with existing infrastructure. There's no need to separately load key management software onto a hardware appliance; no need to install and manage external HSMs; no need to plug in an RNG or other external entropy source; no need to install and manage a separate database as a keystore; no need to separately set up replication, and no need to procure, install, configure, and manage a range of individual components. In addition, conformance with KMIP means that administrators do not need to be experts in key management standards ­ much less quantum technology ­ to set up and take advantage of the features of the TSF key and policy manager.

Networking: The Weak Link - Some key management solutions offer additional protection from an HSM, but as a separate rackmount device rather than an embedded module. Besides the potential integration headaches mentioned above, a security setup that links several devices through networking cables can present its own issues.
Though the devices may be hardened and make secure transfers before the data's final destination, a weak link in the network chain could nullify any security efforts and negatively impact performance. Similarly, any kind of hardware or software failure of one of the devices can impact the whole system.
Support That's Integrated, Too - A bundled solution of different devices may perform as expected, but if things don't go as planned, such as a failure that can't be fixed easily, this bundled solution transforms into a new problem as you juggle support conversations and accrue maintenance overhead.
With a single integrated, interoperable device, your support and maintenance are streamlined and simplified. Support staff is available on a 24/7/365 basis. With the TSF key and policy manager, you have one vendor, one device, and one phone call.
