VULNERABILITY
Private bug bounties resolve the most vulnerabilities. Eighty percent of customers run private bug bounty programs but there are other reasons for the high vulnerability count.
Private programs are often a first step on the bug bounty journey and therefore are likely to yield higher results than a mature public program.
There's less competition among hackers in a private program, meaning they will discover a greater number of valid findings and fewer duplicate findings.
Hackers also spend more time with private programs where they are more likely to be rewarded. In public programs, they risk submitting duplicate vulnerabilities, and those don't qualify for rewards.

VULNERABILITY
While traditional bug bounties saw a 10% increase in findings in the past 12 months, Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs) saw 47% vulnerability growth, and hacker-powered pentests rose 264%.
We're seeing a significant increase in the percentage of vulnerabilities surfaced from VDPs and pentests. Pentest vulnerabilities made up 0.9% of all vulnerabilities in 2020. That has increased to 3% in the past 12 months.
Significantly more customers launched pentests in 2021 than 2020. We've seen an enhanced customer focus on compliance with security regulations and standards, which is driving the requirement for pentests.
We're also seeing customers bridging the security and development lifecycle with frequent assessments during product or feature releases. They're adding pentests to their existing continuous security testing programs.
As the adoption of hacker-powered solutions grows beyond bug bounty, they prove their value, not only for meeting regulatory standards but also for shoring up digital asset security.

TOP 10 VULNERABILITIES
In the past 12 months, reports for Business Logic Errors increased by 67%, putting this vulnerability category on the Top 10 for the first time, replacing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) as number 10.
 Information disclosure rose from third to second place, with a 59% increase in reports, and code Injection saw a 13% increase in reports, increasing from 9th to 7th place.
The most significant shift in the Top 10 is Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) falling from 4th place to 9th. Improvements in cloud computing environments (AWS) have made that class of vulnerability easier to mitigate. Additionally, a number of high-profile breaches have been attributed to SSRF vulnerabilities, meaning security leaders are encouraging a focus on finding and fixing SSRF vulnerabilities across their networks.

BOUNTY PRICING
Prices for medium and lowerimpact bugs are falling. This suggests focus is shifting to highvalue findings, as organizations rely on hackers to find the vulnerabilities that traditional scanning solutions miss.
The top tier of hackers are in high demand as organizations trust them to find bugs with the most severe impact, or to have the creativity to chain multiple low-severity bugs into one finding. The primary way customer programs bid for the time and effort of these top-tier hackers is to increase the reward for the highestimpact bugs.
Medium and low-severity bugs are much easier to find, and typically don't represent the same risk to organizations as critical or high severity vulnerabilities. Therefore, there's less need for customers to bid higher rewards for them.

REMEDIATION

Speed is cited as a key measurement in showing how effectively security teams stay on top of threats.
In the past year, the industry-wide median time to resolution fell by 19% from 33 days to 26.7, with some industries such as retail and e-commerce seeing time-toremediation dropping by more than 50%. This is due to a number of factors. First, we're seeing better governance models across the industries, with CISOs having increased authority and power to take action.
Customers are focusing their investments in tooling and staff to provide greater insight into vulnerabiity management and to improve time-to-remediation. Finally, with high-profile ransomware attacks demonstrating an existential threat, there has been increased attention on vulnerability management practices.

CONCLUSION
Hacker-powered security has gone beyond simply paying a hacker for a bug they found on a one-off basis.
Today's leading CISOs and security teams are leveraging the skills and expertise of a professional, committed community of hackers as a core piece of their overall security testing strategy. The data and vulnerability insights organizations gain from their bug bounty, VDPs, and pentests are enabling them to better identify where problems are originating and where resources and training need to be directed. Knowing what vulnerabilities your peers are prioritizing, how they're fixing them, and what value they ascribe them, can help you build or enhance your own security testing program.
