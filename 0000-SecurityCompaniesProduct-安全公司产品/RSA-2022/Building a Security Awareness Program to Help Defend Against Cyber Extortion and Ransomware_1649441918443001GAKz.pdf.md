DEFENDING AGAINST CYBER EXTORTION
Cyber extortion is listed as one of the top worries by cybersecurity professionals throughout the world, with good reason. Ransomware gangs have attacked tens of thousands of organizations from small to very large, brought down hospitals, pipelines, police stations and even entire ports.
At the heart of cyber extortion is the basic idea that if you take something unique and precious from someone, they will pay to have it back. If you discover someone's secret, they will pay you to keep it secret. If they consume all your bandwidth so you cannot conduct business, you will pay them to stop. The microcosmic market of one seller and one desperate buyer, with almost zero risk for the criminal, drives extortion prices and immense profits.
Because of its rise in sophistication and volume, organizations are asked by their cyber insurers, regulators and shareholders to step up their defenses against this threat. Similarly, to other cybersecurity goals, this is not achieved by deploying a shiny "anti-ransomware" tool, but rather through a defense in depth model with multiple layers of control.
The top initial exploit causes that allow cyber extortionists to compromise devices and environments are (in order of popularity): Social Engineering/Phishing, Unpatched Software, Abuse of Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Authentication Attacks.
Building a security culture, or in other words, strengthening your human defense layer and making them aware of how to detect and prevent the initial compromises listed above, is a crucial element in your defense in depth model.
This document outlines an awareness program with the objective of strengthening your organization's human layer of defense as a key control in the fight against cyber extortion attacks.
BEHAVIOR DESIGN IN SECURITY AWARENESS
Traditional awareness efforts are based on the belief (or hope) that information leads to action. And although it is an important first step, the limitation with awareness is that "awareness" itself does not automatically result in secure behavior. The goal therefore should be finding effective "behavioral interventions" to bridge the awareness, intention and behavior gap.
Let's look at the problem through the lens of behavior design. BJ Fogg is a social scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford University and referred to as the father of behavior design. BJ Fogg's behavior design model neatly outlines that behavior happens when three things come together at the same time:
Motivation, Ability and a Prompt
2

Motivation
Fogg's Behavior Model highlights three core motivators: Sensation, Anticipation and Belonging. Each of these has two sides: pleasure/ pain, hope/fear, acceptance/rejection. These core motivators apply to everyone; they are central to the human experience.
The list below outlines suggested interventions to trigger people's motivation:
· Tapping into people's emotions by using visually appealing content,
engaging with humor and story-based techniques, will activate positive sensations.
 Caveat: Humor is a great technique to grab people's attention, evoke positive emotions
and help with memory retention. However, it has to be applied carefully and with a sensitivity to the audience's cultures, or else it can backfire. Also, it should not be used too much, as it could result in the audience not taking the core message seriously enough.
· Fear can be a powerful motivator too. But too much of it can result in apathy and needs to be
underpinned with the notion that it is simple to defend. Show people how to defend themselves. Give them the knowledge and/or tools to feel empowered rather than afraid.
· Using the power of leadership or celebrity to tell stories invokes a sense of belonging. · Making it personally relevant by providing information on how to protect family members. · Happy people make secure people ­ communicate that phishing simulations are not there to
trick people, but a training exercise only. Work on building a trust relationship between Security and the rest of the community.
· Recognition to drive participation. For example, public shout-outs by the CEO if someone reported
a significant potential threat.
· Competitions and rewards such as phishing tournaments whereby participants can win if they
report a specific number of simulated phishes over a certain period of time.
Ability
BJ Fogg says that training people is hard work, and most people resist learning new things. That is just how we are as humans. Giving someone a tool or a resource that makes it easier to do helps break down that barrier. A great example is a password manager. It takes care of desired behavior and simplifies the complexity of having to remember multiple unique passwords. So, when running a ransomware awareness campaign, we need to ask ourselves where are opportunities to provide tools that make it easier for people to stay safe? For example:
· Games to "train" the spotting of phishing attacks in repetitive ways
that convert knowledge into intuitive situational awareness.
· Equip people with tools such as phish-alert buttons, password managers, home security, etc. · Simple how-to guides and short explainer videos or training modules.

Prompts
The concept of prompt has different names: cue, trigger, call to action, request and so on, and they all have the purpose to remind and tell people to "do it now". A good example is the password strength meters reminding people to come up with better passwords as and when they create them.
When designing your ransomware awareness campaign, it is important to consider where prompts may be used, i.e.:
· When users join the company, educate them about the extortion threat · Notes about latest phishing scams · Phishing detection warnings in user's email clients (i.e., notes such as "are you sure you can trust
this link / attachment?")

BUILDING YOUR CAMPAIGN
When it is possible to combine the three elements of motivation, ability and prompts, changing behavior is a much more likely outcome than just spreading awareness content and hoping for a result.

4. Authentication Attacks
Social engineering is consistently the number one root cause used by ransomware and other malware attacks to gain initial access.
It makes sense therefore to consider raising awareness around these initial attack vectors amongst the groups typically responsible for them.

Final Thoughts & Best Practices
There are some best practices which we have picked up over the years that help when embarking on a security awareness and culture campaign: 1. Do not manage what you cannot measure. Create a baseline view of your current awareness
status by running a proficiency or security culture assessment and track it every 12 months. This will allow you to showcase improvements. Phish-prone PercentageTM (PPP) can help as a tracking metric, but can be manipulated by changing phish sophistication levels, so this needs to be reported in context. 2. Involve your executives. Executive involvement goes beyond sponsorship or budget approval for the campaign. Your executives should be the face of your campaign, people look at what their leaders are doing. 3. Do not do it alone. Work with your marketing, internal communications, HR and compliance teams, amongst others, to gain input and approval for your campaign plan. 4. Combine training with frequent phishing simulations. Doing quarterly phishing is not enough. Everyone in the company should get a randomly-assigned phish every week (or as often as your corporate culture will tolerate ­ at least monthly). This gamifies the experience as every email needs to be scrutinized. Create targeted or customized phishing emails for your privileged users. 5. Remediation training for frequent clickers. Provide in depth remediation training for frequent clicker-groups, which gets automatically assigned upon a pre-set number of "clicks." This ensures training is targeted at people who need it.
Suggested cyber extortion awareness campaign plan By applying BJ Fogg's behavior design model, considering the top exploit causes as well as the best practice points listed above, your cyber extortion awareness campaign becomes more targeted and effective. If you are already a KnowBe4 customer, please speak to your Customer Success Manager for guidance around relevant training modules.
