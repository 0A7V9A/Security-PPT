About the customer
SentinelOne is a cybersecurity solutions company based in Mountain View, California. It has more than 800 employees and almost 5,000 customers. The company's flagship Singularity Platform combines an autonomous endpoint protection platform (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR), IoT security, and cloud workload protection (CWPP).
Its solutions meet the cybersecurity requirements of some of the world's most demanding government and defense agencies and enterprises in healthcare, finance, energy, retail, and other fields.

Customer challenge
SentinelOne's FedRAMP certification effort was stalled.
The company's cloud-based technology was very complex and cutting edge, featuring distributed AI and enterprise-scale data analytics. It works across Linux and Windows servers in Amazon EC2 environments and workloads in Docker and Kubernetes containers, as well as on a wide variety of endpoints.
SentinelOne was anxious to achieve FedRAMP moderate certification and have its solutions hosted in Amazon AWS GovCloud regions so it could grow its footprint in the U.S. federal government and defense marketplace. Potential revenue was being lost every day that they could not deliver the solution to their customers. The outside consultant hired to lead the certification effort wasn't moving fast enough to meet the company's goals.

Results and benefits

Solution
When investigating alternatives, the chief information security officer (CISO) of SentinelOne came across information about Anitian SecureCloud for Compliance Automation.
Their pre-configured solution included a cloud security infrastructure with a complete stack of security and compliance technologies and controls, integrated with each other and with native tools of the AWS cloud platform. Chris Bates, SentinelOne's CISO, verified that this infrastructure had already enabled several other companies achieve FedRAMP certification and was therefore a known viable solution. "I brought Anitian in because they had a pre-configured security stack, so I didn't have to worry about making compliance work or getting past my audit."
His team would not have to spend time researching FedRAMP requirements, designing a compliant environment, or evaluating security products. They could simply "wire up" their application into the SecureCloud pre-built infrastructure.

SecureCloud for Compliance Automation dramatically shortened SentinelOne's wait time to achieve FedRAMP certification and begin generating revenue from U.S. federal government and defense agencies.
SentinelOne's application was ready for the audit for FedRAMP moderate certification (which requires demonstrating compliance with 325 controls) just 10 weeks after beginning the project with Anitian. It obtained Authority to Operate (ATO) in only 8 months.
The company's EPP product is now hosted on the FedRAMP.gov website and is being used by several U.S. federal agencies. FedRAMP authorization has given SentinelOne credibility not only with federal agencies, but also with a wide variety of organizations that serve government customers.
