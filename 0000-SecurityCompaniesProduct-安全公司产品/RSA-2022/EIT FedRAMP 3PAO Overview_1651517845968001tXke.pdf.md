ASSESSMENT & ADVISORY SERVICES
Readiness Assessment
Ready to attract an agency sponsor? EIT can quickly support the Readiness Assessment stage with a fourweek timeline that may lead to your "FedRAMP Ready" designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.
Assessment & Attestation
Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists and understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. EIT will develop a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Assessment Report (SAR) and deliver your recommendation for authorization.

Gap Assessment
Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your operations and security architecture.
Advisory & Remediation
EIT offers organizations strategic guidance to align product roadmaps with FedRAMP requirements and builds turnkey and audit-ready system security documentation so CSPs can achieve and maintain their position on the marketplace.
Compliance as a Service
Having difficulty managing multiple security and compliance frameworks? EIT can establish an organized and integrated compliance program that meets your organization's key business and security initiatives.

EIT has Dual-Expertise
Operating on both sides of the FedRAMP lifecycle informs our decisions and enables our
customer to succeed.

Advisors make the best Assessors
As a Type-C 3PAO, we support all aspects of the FedRAMP process, from advisory through Assessment and Continuous Monitoring.
Context Matters
Our team brings an in-depth understanding of security controls and their intent, in addition to the strong technical background required for a rigorous assessment.
Security over compliance
Our FedRAMP team is a select group of highlyvetted assessors and SMEs fluent in NIST 800-53, Department of Defense requirements, and how they relate to commercial cloud environments.
We know the process
Our decades of experience serving both Federal and Commercial clients provides an intimate understanding of FedRAMP requirements and the interpretation of controls of the JAB and agency sponsors.

"We were and are continuously blown away by EITs performance. EIT consistently impresses, from our initial vendor selection interviews all the way to today...we are very glad to have EIT as our partners through our FedRAMP journey."
CISO, Legal & Discovery Solutions Provider
EIT began our FedRAMP 3PAO practice as a straight-forward assessor. But we soon realized that almost none of our customers were able to pass the audit because they
lacked effective consultation. We quickly introduced our advisory practice to deliver consulting solutions that include delivering audit-ready documentation, business strategy and product roadmap alignment, and one-on-one coaching ahead of audits.

CONTACT EIT to elevate your security posture through threatbased, quantifiable assessments.
