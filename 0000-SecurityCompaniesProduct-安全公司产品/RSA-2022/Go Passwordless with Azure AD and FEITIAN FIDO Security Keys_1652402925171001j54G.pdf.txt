with Azure AD and FEITIAN FIDO Security Keys


Secure Authentication

No Shared Secret

WHY

Headline password and password reuse
Researches show that people tend to use passwords that are easy to remember, such as "passw0rd", "12345678" and use the same password across multiple web services. This creates shortcut for attackers to replay the passwords to different services.

Phishing and MITM
The most common attacks against password authentication scheme are phishing and MITM attacks. Hackers can trick users to visit and log in to a fake website, where the user gives away sensitive login data and performs a fraudulent transaction. The so called man-in-the middle is even more aggressive, it hijacks the communication between the user and service, and automatically redirects the user to the fake website.

HOW
To eliminate passwords and strengthen security, FEITIAN has worked tirelessly with the Microsoft and FIDO2 development teams. We see the FIDO2 solutions as having a significant impact on enterprise security and cloud solution functionality. We believe this collaboration will be a significant development in FIDO2 technology. Innovation in the FIDO space is crucial to industry development. FEITIAN is dedicated to improving the FIDO2 security solution so as to secure enterprise as well as increase usability for the individual.
