SOLUTION OVERVIEW
Effortless Password Security for Employees Working from Anywhere

LastPass Business
When 80% of breaches are due to passwords1, people's own password practices remain the weakest point in a company's security and may be putting sensitive data at risk. While employees just want to work efficiently from anywhere, businesses need to ensure the proper security controls are in place.
For more than 85,000 businesses, LastPass reduces friction for employees while increasing control and visibility with a password management solution that is easy to manage and effortless to use. LastPass empowers employees to generate, secure, and share credentials seamlessly, while ensuring protection through LastPass' zero-knowledge security infrastructure.
In addition to password management, LastPass offers additional security features, such as single sign-on (SSO) with simplified access to up to three cloud applications and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that secures the LastPass vault and the configured single sign-on applications.
