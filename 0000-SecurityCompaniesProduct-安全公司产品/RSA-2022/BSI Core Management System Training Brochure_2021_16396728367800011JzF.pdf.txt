Training delivered the way you want

Training is rarely a one-off need and BSI can help you along every step of the journey.
From everyday training needs to ongoing skills development and support, we provide business-wide training programs. Depending on your requirements, we can deliver training in various formats.

Online training for complete flexibility
· Training online can help you nurture talent from within your organization, from wherever you're located.
· Hosted in virtual classrooms, you can engage with instructors and each other, to help properly embed best practices within your organization, and ensure you're ready for any challenge.
· You can study from anywhere in the world and still benefit from trusted expertise, all with languages and at times to suit you.
· And without the need to travel, training online also helps all of us to be more sustainable in the way we work.
· You can join our online training courses with students from other organizations, where you'll network, connect, and learn from shared experience.
· Or an expert BSI instructor can run the same course dedicated to your organization, so you benefit directly from a consistent, flexible approach that provides personal development for your colleagues, no matter where they're located.
· The interactive experience uses the same learning techniques as classroom courses, with activities, breakouts, teamwork, and discussions, so you get the same value, skills, knowledge, and learning outcomes.

Your copy of the standard
For standards-based training courses, you will be given a loaner copy of the standard for the duration of your course. We recommend that you are familiar with the content of the standard before the course, and it may be beneficial to bring your own copy so that you can add notes if you choose.
Prerequisites
Some of our courses have specific perquisites ­ usually having a working knowledge of the standard is a good starting point. To make sure that you and the other students on your course get the best value from your instructor, please ensure that you meet the entry criteria. Please speak to one of our advisors if you're unsure.
