SOLUTION BRIEF
Experience the LogicHub SOAR+ Difference

Challenges with traditional SOAR
Like most security operations teams, yours is probably buried by an overwhelming volume of alerts that requires learning and using dozens of specialized tools to address different threats, each with its own set of processes and tasks. And that buries your analysts in repetitive, low-value, time-consuming activities. Instead of taking a strategic approach to security, they end up reacting to individual threats without ever getting ahead of the problem.

SOAR (security orchestration, automation, and response) solutions entered the market to address these challenges. But traditional SOAR solutions are difficult to implement, and once they're up and running, SecOps teams don't know where to start automating or what playbooks to build. Often, the out-of-the box content doesn't map well to the organization's environment and requires extensive development time to customize. And even once the solution has been implemented, traditional SOARs aren't architected to handle the high volume of event and alert data to analyze, investigate, and triage threats. That means companies remain stuck with lengthy mean-times-to-detect.
