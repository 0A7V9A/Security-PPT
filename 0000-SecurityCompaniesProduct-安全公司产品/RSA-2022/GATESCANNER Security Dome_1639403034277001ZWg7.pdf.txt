Security Dome
Holistic supply chain security
The Challenge
Sharing information is critical for every organization's activities but is also a source of concern. Receiving les from software providers, customers, suppliers and partners can introduce risks since le-based attacks including Zero Days, Exploits, and other weaponized content can evade detectionbased technologies. Today there are multiple content collaboration platforms , and while they protect data "in- ight", they require integrating advanced threat prevention technologies to ensure that the les saved in them are safe.. These integrations require ongoing management, so organizations still nd themselves having to balance security and usability leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks.
The Solution
In order to meet this challenge, GateScanner Security Dome protects multiple content delivery routes in one solution, by integrating the award winning GateScanner® Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) technology to ensure that every le delivered is safe. GateScanner CDR combines highly optimized Multi-AV and NextGen Detection technologies to block known threats and prevents undetectable attacks using proprietary le disarm, transforming every le into a neutralized (harmless) trustworthy copy, protecting against weaponized content that has never been seen before.
