LiveNX DATA SHEET

LiveNX Data Sheet

THE CHALLENGE
Network Management teams routinely perform several activities to plan, deploy, upgrade, maintain, troubleshoot, and monitor the network. Each of these activities are extremely data-driven and are heavily dependent on the network team's accurate understanding and interpretation of the data coming from applications, network devices and the traffic moving over their network.
THE SOLUTION
LiveNX is a network and application performance monitoring platform with patented end-to-end visualization for a global view of the network and the ability to drill-down to individual devices. Using LiveNX, enterprises gain real-time and continuous insight into network traffic based on application and user level activity.
LiveNX offers the ability to gather and analyze volumes of network data at scale from every device, application, and user to reduce mean time to repair, and it performs exploratory and explanatory analysis.

KEY BENEFITS
Achieve Network-Wide Visibility get full visibility into network and application performance across multi-vendor, multi-domain and multi-cloud networked environments for increased productivity and a better user experience.
Optimize Performance proactively identify, troubleshoot, and quickly resolve network and application performance issues regardless of where they occur to speed time to repair, avoid costly downtime, and meet business needs.
Unify Network Data simplify network monitoring and accelerate troubleshooting by unifying all key network monitoring data types, including network packets, onto a single platform across the entire network, so that IT staff can focus on strategic initiatives.

LiveNX DATA SHEET

Key Capabilities
Unified Data on a Single Platform  Correlate multiple data sets to provide views,
graphs and maps to illustrate the current state of applications and network performance  Gain visibility into underlay and overlays, tunnel performance for SD-WAN deployments  See the entire network by unifying data from virtually anywhere ­ WAN, SD-WAN, WiFi, remote sites, datacenters, and multi-cloud including AWS and Azure.  Automatically do a device discovery and quickly create an exhaustive inventory of every Device and Interface in the network
Topology views for enterprise wide visibility and situational awareness
Network Performance Monitoring  Visualize devices, interfaces, applications,
VPNs, and users.  Overlay network and application performance
data on your network topology to achieve a clear mental model of how the network relates to performance  Baseline network performance ­ always understand what `normal' is for your current network configuration and understand status deviations.
