Onspring Case Study: Vulnerability & IT Risk Management

Vulnerability & IT Risk Management
A Technology Services Case Study

OVERVIEW
Building technology roadmaps as a CTO-as-a-Service provider was so successful for Leverage Corporation that it was only a matter of time before they expanded into technology sourcing, servicing, asset, vulnerability scanning, and IT risk management to better serve their nationwide customer base.
Soon after adopting Onspring, Leverage Corporation needed a reporting engine to manage the intake from commercial vulnerability scans.
Reporting needed to provide their team with meaningful visualizations of data with actionable insights. Norman Harber, CEO, led the creation of a custom-built application in Onspring to launch their new vulnerability management service--all completely designed and created by their own internal team with no dev or IT resources.
