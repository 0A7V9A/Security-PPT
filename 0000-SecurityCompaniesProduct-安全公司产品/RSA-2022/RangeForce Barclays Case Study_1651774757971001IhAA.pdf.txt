How Barclays Upskills a Global Security Team with RangeForce
Solution
Realistic attack scenarios can be deployed in highly realistic virtual environments to facilitate team-based exercises against real threats. These exercises expose teams to real-world cyber attacks in familiar settings, featuring real IT infrastructure, real security tools, and real threats. The intense exercise provides ideal practice space for individuals and teams and quickly reveals operational gaps and weaknesses in existing security processes. Following a threat exercise, an After-Action Report is provided to teams to provide next-steps for a remedial skills development plan using the RangeForce platform.
Key Outcomes
Improved coordination and cooperation across global security teams Identified and remediated operational security weaknesses Developed a continuous and metric-driven training program
Results
Since 2015, RangeForce has trained over 400 Barclays employees throughout the world, including Cape Town, Prague, London, and New York City.
