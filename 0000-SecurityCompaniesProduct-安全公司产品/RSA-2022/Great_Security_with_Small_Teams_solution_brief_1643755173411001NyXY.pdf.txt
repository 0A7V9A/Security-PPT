SOLUTION BRIEF

Ease the Burdens on Your Cybersecurity Team
Boost Your Cybersecurity Program with Tripwire ExpertOps

Quote
"Security teams shouldn't overburden themselves by trying to do everything on their own. They can partner with trusted vendors for managed services or subscribe to service plans where outside experts can act as an extension of the team."
-- Tim Erlin, Tripwire VP of Product Management and Strategy

Few industries have undergone as drastic a change in recent years as cybersecurity. The proliferation of new types of cyberattacks, in addition to rapid progress in cloud computing and automation, sets organizations and agencies up to need more cybersecurity professionals than they can possibly find and retain given the shortage of qualified talent on the market.

This leaves security managers, directors, and CISOs in a dangerous position if they place non-security IT professionals in security roles and hope for the best, as many organizations have done out of a lack of better options. One solution organizations can turn to is a managed service. It is possible to maintain powerful security operations with small teams if you know where to look.
Training and Retaining Cybersecurity Staff
There simply aren't enough cybersecurity professionals to meet industry demand. In order to manage the

shortage of cybersecurity talent on their teams, organizations and agencies often leverage IT professionals with no cybersecurity background into cybersecurity positions.
Overwhelmed Security Teams
Small security teams are often overburdened with managing complex security tools to handle their most important responsibilities, like file integrity monitoring (FIM), security configuration management (SCM), and vulnerability management (VM). They often have too many tools to manage and not enough bandwidth to focus on strategic cybersecurity initiatives. When staff transitions,

a lack of proficiency with security tools makes for awkward and incomplete hand-offs. Training new cybersecurity tool administrators can quickly become a resource drain as well.
Ineffective Security Operations
The current threat landscape pits underprepared IT professionals against cyber adversaries that use sophisticated and ever-evolving plans of attack. Not effectively leveraging the full capabilities of security tools can lead to breaches going undetected for months, costing organizations and agencies untold resources.
How Managed Services Help
No organization or agency has the power to drastically alter the supply-todemand ratio of qualified candidates in the cybersecurity industry. Managed services can solve staffing and resource challenges within your organization, arming your team with the necessary security expertise to thwart cyberattacks and maintain optimal compliance configurations.
Consolidate Vendors and Tools
If your security team is underprepared, crowding their processes with too many tools and vendors is not going to help. Vendor and tool consolidation takes some time up front, but it's well worth the effort to narrow your toolkit down to the products and services that actually help do the heavy lifting of security operations--rather than flood your team's inboxes with unnecessary notifications.
Extend the Efficacy of Stretched Teams
Less is more when it comes to using the resources of a stretched team wisely. Strategically implementing managed services is the best way to get your security operations where they need to be. Rather than trying to recruit and train in a scarce talent market, extend your team with a dedicated engineer from your security solutions vendor. This security-as-a-service model means

you'll have an expert who stays in sync with your team, offering customized advice for improvement every step of the way.
How to Evaluate Managed Services
Once you've made the decision to seek out a managed services solution, how do you evaluate it to ensure that it meets all of your criteria? What will the total cost of ownership be compared to keeping security operations in-house--and the hiring and training that would require?
Here are the most important considerations you must keep top-of-mind when assessing the overall value of a managed services cybersecurity solution:
» Advanced FIM, SCM, and VM, with enforced policy compliance
» Advice, incident assistance and audit support
» A designated expert assigned to your team
» A vulnerability and exposure expert assigned to your team to help you mature your VM program

This tier provides day-today maintenance of the console and managed nodes for clients that need change management, compliance, and vulnerability information. This is ideal if you're just getting started with change management or compliance practices.

In addition, this tier provides proactive risk monitoring and assessment, dedicated problem resolution support, and vulnerability remediation recommendations.
Advanced Plus
The most robust and comprehensive Tripwire ExpertOps subscription also includes custom policies, process assistance, and unlimited change requests, as well as DSR and the Tripwire Enterprise Integration Framework. With Advanced Plus, an assigned program coordinator will work with you to develop an operational use plan with best practice recommendations, as well as assistance with change reconciliation and prioritization of suggested remediation activities. This tier also provides integrations with threat intelligence, change management, incident management, and configuration management database (CMDB) tools.

Summary
Many cybersecurity teams struggle with a skills gap. It might be that your team is too small for their responsibilities, or that you're finding it difficult to attract, train, and retain talent. Turnover is a common problem, with organizations and agencies often losing skilled individuals to new opportunities. Fortunately, strategically selecting a comprehensive managed services solution closes the skills gap and allows constrained teams to successfully run cybersecurity programs. Tripwire ExpertOps equips such teams with the advice and support needed to protect your data from cyberattacks while maintaining regulatory compliance.
