Accedian Cyber Resiliency Services

Cyber attackers are waiting patiently for just one person in your organization to make one small mistake
Cyber resiliency hardening of your organization involves more than just adding new tools to your security operations center (SOC), responding to alerts, or buying cyber insurance. A thorough cyber resiliency program needs to address every thread in the tapestry of your business because a cyber attacker only needs to find one loose thread to unravel business continuity and put you at risk.
In the face of today's unrelenting and ever increasing cyberattacks, we know it's not easy. We also know that it's a matter of "when", and not "if", every organization operating in today's business climate will be breached.

Successful teams take a risk-based approach to ensure their business continuity
Cyber Resiliency Services can help you quickly and confidently reinforce your Cyber Resiliency program with adaptive, preventative methods:
· Easily close staff and skills gaps with proven experts and tools
· Select comprehensive service bundles or à la carte options to suit your needs and budget
· Jumpstart the organizational and cultural changes necessary to maintain business continuity
· Take advantage of an award-winning delivery team recognized by Gartner (Top 10 Security Consulting Vendor) & Clutch (Top Cyber Security Company in 2020)
Fortify your security posture and maintain business continuity in the face of today's unrelenting and sophisticated cyberattacks.

The average time to detect and contain a breach in 2021 was
287 days1
That's 287 days too many.
"It is very comforting to know we have eyes everywhere instead of hoping. I don't believe in hope, I believe in taking preventative measures."
