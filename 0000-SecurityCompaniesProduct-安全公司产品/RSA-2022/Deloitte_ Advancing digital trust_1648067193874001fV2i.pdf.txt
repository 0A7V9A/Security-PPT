Introduction

IN AN ERA of ever-present digital threats that can undermine and erode stakeholder trust, organizations should invest to earn "digital trust," that is, protect their data and information from fraud and bad actors to safeguard their relationships, reputation, and revenue. This task could be more difficult than ever before as technology and the threats to digital trust it enables continue to evolve. For example, deepfakes--fake digital images, videos, or audio that can be generated using artificial intelligence (AI) at the click of a button--can already be used to impersonate individuals. Such an impersonation caused a CEO of an energy company to approve a US$243,000 wire transfer to a fictional supplier in 2019.1 While deepfake scams are still a relatively new threat, they grew more than 900% annually between 2017 and 2019,2 and were estimated to have cost businesses more than US$250 million in 2020.3
The stakes are high, and any misstep can impact customer loyalty, financial performance, brand

equity, and ultimately undermine an organization's ability to build and maintain trust. Surveys suggest that 81% of consumers lose trust in a brand after a breach, while 25% completely stop interacting with it.4 The stakes became even higher as the pandemic accelerated digital work infrastructures5 and drove spending on emerging tech security strategies and solutions.6
While many leaders understand the threats to digital trust, they may find it difficult to augment traditional cybersecurity measures with more advanced solutions. What will best address today's digital trust needs? When preparing for tomorrow, what investments in digital trust solutions are the most effective bets? There are certainly many options--our analysis found at least 2,000 patents related to digital trust filed annually7 between 2015 and 2020--illustrating why it can be hard to choose the right tools.

Where to invest today and tomorrow

As leaders consider where to place their investments to improve digital trust, it's important to note that addressing digital trust should include an end-toend interdisciplinary approach across people, process, governance, and regulation, with technology being a key enabler. In this study, we focus on advanced technology enablers that organizations can explore, over and beyond existing cyber measures, to enhance digital trust. Our interviews with 15 global subject matter specialists and leaders found four promising technology solutions--AI-based data monitoring, cloud-enabled data trusts, blockchain, and quantum technologies. We further validated these findings by analyzing the trends in digital trust­related patents granted over the last five to six years to gauge the maturity of

these emerging technologies vis-à-vis digital trust. While there are many innovations in commercially available solutions that are unpatented, for this study, we look at patents as they help provide a window into broad innovation areas and maturity. And we exclusively analyze granted patents, rather than including the patent applications, as they are better indicators of truly differentiated, credible innovation to watch (see appendix, "Digital trust innovation research"). Based on the maturity of these solutions, two of them seem able to meet today's needs. The other two are future bets for the near and long term, which may help organizations stay ahead of evolving threats for the foreseeable future.

WHAT DO WE MEAN BY DIGITAL TRUST?
Building on Deloitte's definition of trust,8 we define digital trust as the confidence among customers, employees, partners, and other stakeholders in an organization's ability to create and maintain the integrity of all digital assets (including data/information, architectures, applications, and infrastructure) across stakeholder experiences, strategic insights, organizational platforms, and network connectivity.9 This digital trust ensures transparency and accessibility, security and reliability, privacy and control, and ethics and responsibility.10

Solutions that enhance digital trust today

ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING TO enhance digital trust today can already invest in relatively mature, common solutions; however, advanced solutions that may currently be limited to select industries or use cases have the potential to offer new capabilities. These advanced solutions should not replace existing cyber measures; rather, they can provide complementary and additive digital trust advantages. Our research revealed two advanced solutions that organizations can consider adopting today: AI-based data monitoring and data trusts.
AI-based monitoring of data, its access and use
Of the many applications where AI could be applied to improve digital trust, our research uncovered some business cases where AI monitoring can help, especially when validating contextual data accuracy and governing data access and usage by participants across an ecosystem.
AI can help make sure data is correct and isn't tampered with and, therefore, can be trusted. Manually identifying and cleaning poor-quality data, including incorrect, stale, missing, or poorly labelled data, can be time-consuming and expensive.11 It costs organizations an average of US$13 million annually.12 Furthermore, if a bad data model is ingested, it can compromise outcomes and amplify the effects of bad information.13 AI can help validate information accuracy, authenticity, and reliability for data in context.14 Today, AI-based solutions can detect missing data, anomalies, or unexpected data in real time.14 Emerging AI solutions are able to

identify fake or manipulated documents, images, deepfake videos, and more.16 Deepfake-detection algorithms can check for digital integrity such as the presence of grayscale pixels at the boundaries of manipulated sections.17 They can also check for physical irregularities such as inaccurate shadows and reflections, and biometric irregularities such as lip movement, blinking, and pupil shape.18 Facebook and Michigan State University's model identifies deepfakes with reportedly 70% accuracy, by reverseengineering aspects of the AI used to create it.19 Such solutions can help build trust in the data, related processes, and the insights generated from it.
AI can improve identity and access management. It can help flag and prevent unauthorized data access, detect abnormal user behavior, or other anomalies.20 Behavioral solutions can establish authorized user identities and block bot accounts based on users' interaction patterns with devices.21 Spam filters based on machine learning (ML) reduce the risk of unauthorized access attempts via phishing or social engineering attacks22--some of the most common ways to infect systems with malware or ransomware and gain access to data. A survey found that 75% of respondents agree that behavior-based analytics is the only way to catch complex ransomware attacks.23 Behavior analytics, when combined with unsupervised ML algorithms, can enable more proactive security measures.24 In fact, organizations with fully deployed AI solutions can have up to an 80% lower cost impact from data breach incidents, compared to those without.25
AI can make sure that data is used as intended. For example, organizations can monitor public sites or platforms to identify intellectual property or

Whenever these news sources are appended to stories or references, its key gets tracked, enabling consumers to track its origin and making it difficult to falsify news articles.51
Blockchain can help with trusted identities. This is a key component when it comes to any digital relationship or transaction. Blockchain can verify credentials without revealing details behind that identity and enables decentralized, tamper-proof self-sovereign identities,52 which can be used for various commercial and government services. For example, the government of Zug, Switzerland, created a digital, decentralized, sovereign identity for its citizens, enabling them to partake in activities like casting votes and accessing government services.53 Likewise, MIT piloted blockchain-based, verifiable, tamper-proof diplomas that graduates can securely and easily share externally.54
Blockchain can establish asset ownership. Digital assets, especially cryptocurrencies, comprise a use case currently adopted at scale. According to Deloitte's 2021 Global Blockchain survey, around 40% of respondents say digital assets will have a significantly positive impact on improving compliance and transparency, reducing risk, and enhancing trust.55 Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)-- unique, non-interchangeable data units stored on a blockchain--are emerging as a viable solution to authenticate and certify ownership of digital assets.56 Even though NFTs can be copied, their creator and owner will still be publicly displayed.57 Currently, they're gaining popularity in the art market and with sports memorabilia58 but have the potential for broader application across industries. For example, NFTs can mark health data belonging to a particular person as a form of identification and guarantee of ownership. This also enables patients to know how their data is being used and potentially monetize it.59
Lastly, blockchain can enable faster legal agreements and automate trust. Blockchain-based

smart contracts can help parties agree on terms and transact without any third-party intermediary or escrow, and trust that they will be executed automatically with reduced risk of error or manipulation.60 Partior, a joint venture between Temasek, DBS, and a leading US-based financial services company, is piloting a cross-border payment system based on blockchain and smart contracts in an effort to improve efficiency and trust.61 The company predicts a three-to-five-year time frame for the mass adoption of this platform.62 The technology can also be used for automatic validation of information and digital funds by ports to enable faster processing and releasing of ships.
Despite these wide-ranging use cases, blockchain for digital trust is still in its early days. Technological constraints such as limited transaction throughput, user obfuscation, platform interoperability, along with nontechnical constraints such as limiting incentive mechanisms in public blockchains and the lack of industry standards and regulatory harmony, among others,63 can limit the ability to construct a robust solution that enhances digital trust. However, ongoing rapid innovation and increasing maturity and understanding among stakeholders suggest that we can expect many of these limitations to be addressed in the coming years, resulting in a transformative change to digital trust. Hence, organizations should begin understanding this upcoming digital infrastructure now to incubate future solutions.
Quantum technologies
Quantum technologies will likely impact digital trust in three distinct ways.64 First, the immense computing power that quantum computers promise can be applied to perform vast analytics on cyber and privacy data to detect anomalous or suspicious behavior. Second, quantum technologies' physical properties may offer

8

Where to invest today and tomorrow

enhanced components to cyber systems such as cryptographic key generation and distribution. Third, when fully mature, quantum computing may be able to implement Shor's algorithm,65 which would render some common encryption techniques easy to crack, making data and transactions more vulnerable to attackers.66 Maintaining digital trust in a postquantum world will likely leverage a number of capabilities,67 most notably the use of encryption techniques that are "quantumresistant," also referred to as postquantum cryptography (PQC). PQC runs on classical computers and uses complex mathematical problems believed to be unsolvable by quantum computers. PQC is expected to be interoperable with current communication protocols and networks, making it more cost-effective and easier to maintain.68 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aims to standardize quantum-resistant algorithms by 2024.69 Furthermore, as organizations review their underlying cryptographic processes in anticipation of PQC, it's likely that they will move toward a more crypto-agile state with an improved level of overall cyber hygiene.70 This enhanced awareness of cryptographic reliance could contribute toward improved digital trust.
As mentioned previously, quantum principles can also potentially enhance data-encryption systems,71 using methods such as quantum key distribution (QKD).72 QKD uses quantum mechanics to distribute encryption keys between two parties. Due to the inherent tamper-evident properties of quantum physics, any attempt to eavesdrop the keys would be detected.73

But QKD technology has some limitations, including complex processes, oversized special equipment, and high costs.74 The fragile state of quantum particles involved can significantly limit its coverage and reach.75 Some small-scale, experimental implementations of QKD have been publicized--for example, the integrity and security of the election process in a Swiss canton was protected by incorporating QKD.76 QKD's commercial approval or use for critical systems is challenged unless its limitations are overcome. The US National Security Agency, for example, has currently refrained from supporting the usage of QKD to protect communications in national security systems.77
Because it will be hard to predict when today's internet becomes vulnerable to tomorrow's quantum hackers, and because that moment would be catastrophic for digital trust, it's important that leaders gain awareness and begin to prepare as early as possible. Although the implementation of Shor's algorithm is predicted to be on the order of 10 to 15 years away,78 the time required to gather a full cryptographic inventory, institute a governance process,79 and select and implement PQC algorithms is significant. Hence, organizations should keep a pulse on quantum technology and the related cryptography landscape and ensure timely technology and talent investment for developing the needed crypto-agility and infrastructure.80

Earning digital trust
There's no silver bullet

WHILE THERE'S NO single solution to solve the digital trust puzzle, AI-based monitoring, data trusts, blockchain, and quantum technologies are some of the solutions that can play a valuable role. How might these digital trust tech approaches protect you? Consider the danger that deepfakes pose to organizations. Let's say you've been targeted by bad actors who pose as your company's CEO and attempt a false transaction or data breach. An AI-based monitoring solution that's integrated across your organization's network and applications could alert you to a potential deepfake as a first line of defense and block further attempts. If missed, a robust blockchain-based solution could help easily verify the transaction details and establish fail-safe mechanisms within a smart contract. Additionally, through a data-trust setup, the amount of compromised data could be minimized. Lastly, if your organization someday implements

quantum-resistant safeguards within network and communications channels, other organizations can have much stronger confidence in the integrity of your data and transactions.
Given the rising business impacts, digital trust is not merely a CIO or CISO issue anymore; it requires the CEO and other business leaders to be engaged in technology investments now and into the future. Leaders can't afford to play the waiting game. Rapid technology innovation is enabling new digital threats too quickly. Leaders need to be proactive, sense innovation opportunities, and invest accordingly to weave them into their digitaltrust fabric. This should be an ongoing activity--like a regular rhythm--to maintain and advance digital trust today and tomorrow.

Appendix: Digital trust innovation research

OUR PATENT ANALYSIS found a gradual rise (approximately 15% year over year) in the overall number of digital trust­related patents granted between 2015 and 2020.81 But, the data shows that certain emerging technology families are growing at a much faster rate, indicating their relative importance and popularity. Upon further analysis, the following trends emerge (figure 1):
· Cloud technology has relatively matured in its innovation cycle. And given cloud's ability to enable other technologies--and, in some instances, improve their security and effectiveness--it might be an essential technology for an organization's digital trust strategy.
· AI and ML patents are growing at a brisk pace (35%) and provide numerous avenues today for organizations to enhance digital trust across applications and use cases.

· Blockchain, on the other hand, appears to be in its initial, rapid-growth phase. Blockchain patents have grown by almost 200% YoY over the last three years. This indicates that blockchain may have promising growth potential as an increasingly viable digital trust solution--but has not yet reached peak maturity. Blockchain projects are gradually moving from early proofs-of-concept or pilots to full-scale implementations;82 thus, in the near future, blockchain could play a truly foundational role in establishing digital trust across the enterprise and ecosystem.83
· Quantum technologies are much earlier in their innovation curve; but specialists suggest that they could become vital to ensuring the security of sensitive digital assets as core quantumcomputing capabilities mature.84
