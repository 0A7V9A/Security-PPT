Rubrik for Microsoft 365
Secure your at-risk, critical data with Microsoft-recommended protection

Millions of enterprises today rely on the Microsoft 365 suite for cloud-based communication and document management, capturing immeasurable volumes of data--data that must be backed up, protected, and instantly accessible. Microsoft 365 has truly become a Tier 1 application, which also makes it a target for ransomware. While Microsoft provides perimeter defense and compliance, its governance tools are not designed for recovery in the event of account compromise or accidental data deletion.
SECURITY FOR YOUR CRITICAL MICROSOFT 365 DATA Rubrik provides policy-based protection of Microsoft 365 via its Rubrik SaaS platform. Built on a zero trust architecture, assuming all users, devices and applications are untrustworthy and can be compromised, the solution offers unprecedented security, simplicity and performance for search and restore operations across Exchange Online, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. With Rubrik for Microsoft 365, safeguard from data loss with automated protection at enterprise scale and rapid data recovery to maintain peak availability.
HOW IT WORKS

PROTECT FROM RANSOMWARE
Rubrik secure, air gapped protection separates your backups from the Microsoft 365 tenant and solution. If data is lost, an isolated backup ensures ransomware recovery readiness and provides the confidence you can restore from a clean copy of your data.

TURBOCHARGE RECOVERY
Quickly restore Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams data in just three clicks. Easily locate data with global, predictive, file-level search to recover with near zero RTOs and to
maintain business continuity.

UNIFY MANAGEMENT
Ensure data is secure and always accessible through a single, intuitive dashboard. Eliminate manual job-scheduling and streamline management for tens of thousands of users with one SLA policy across enterprise cloud and SaaS apps.

SECURE SETUP IN MINUTES Rubrik leverages industry-standard modern authentication to establish a secure connection with your Microsoft 365 subscription. All users and organizations are automatically discovered so you can begin assigning policies immediately. Minimize vulnerability as protection assigned at the subscription level is automatically inherited by all managed users.
POLICY-BASED MANAGEMENT AT GLOBAL SCALE Assign data management policies with one SLA policy engine for the entire Microsoft 365 subscription, site, or to individual end users. All user-created and default folders in mailboxes within that organization are automatically protected.

INSTANT SEARCH AND RESTORE FOR RAPID RECOVERY Browse point-in-time snapshots for fast recovery. Restore Microsoft 365 data such as an entire OneDrive, site, mailbox, or even individual folders and items.
Access data immediately with item-level search by email address, date range, or keywords from a subject line or event title. Successfully restore data from both active and inactive users, either back to the original location or exported to another user's mailbox. Easily restore accidentally-deleted SharePoint lists or recover Teams channel posts to the same Teams channel.
Role-based access control and Active Directory Security Groups designate granular user permissions for self-service access and automate security policies.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
"Working for Sesame Workshop, which has a lot of intellectual property and a lot of data in many places, we are always looking to protect against ransomware. That's why we invest in good technology and the best out there to make sure that my team sleeps at night. We also constantly use our backups for file restores and email restores. Especially those cases where we have staff that deletes something, and they forget that they deleted it. They come back to us 60, 90 days later. We have to go back to our backup to recover it. And the only place we can do that from is Rubrik. Easy restores and they have their file in a matter of minutes."
Ruddy Cordero Senior Director of Infrastructure and Operations, Sesame Workshop
"With Rubrik's Microsoft 365 backup solution, we were able to improve our email restoration capability to improve response. One scenario resulted in the hard delete of an email inbox, resulting in a significant resource recovery effort. With Rubrik, we were able to quickly restore the 20 GB inbox and keep related project operations on schedule. This was a big win for our team and JE Dunn as a business; we avoided unnecessary project risk with Rubrik's Microsoft 365 protection."
Jason Hull Senior Systems Manager, JE Dunn
"With Rubrik, It was a snap to set up our Microsoft 365 integration and protect 4,000 accounts with one SLA. We can now restore a user's emails in minutes and can recover a complete inbox (several GB) in little more than an hour. Previously, this would have taken two or more hours since we would have needed to restore a complete volume to recover a mailbox. What was previously a cumbersome, time consuming process has now been completely simplified with Rubrik's ability to perform granular Microsoft 365 restores."
