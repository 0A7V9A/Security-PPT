Mobile Application Protection Suite (MAPS)

1 MAPS Solution Brief

Building Safe and Secure Apps

Today, mobile applications are an effective digital channel for worker productivity and business growth, but they also introduce unprecedented risk. Organizations developing and using mobile apps are keenly aware of security risks as mobile apps access and process more sensitive information than ever before.
Mobile application risks start in development and persist throughout the app's entire lifecycle, including when running on an end user's device. Uncovering these during development saves time, money, and resources associated when compared to reacting to them in production. Once an app is published, it remains exposed to the untrusted environments in which it runs. These risks include compromised devices running the app, the vulnerable networks the device connects to, and bad actors attempting to tamper the app for their benefit.
When left unchecked these risks can lead to the following:

90%
of mobile time is spent in apps
83%
of the apps insecurely stored data
High-risk vulnerabilities were found in
38% of iOS and in 43% of
Android applications
89%
of all vulnerabilities discovered could be exploited using malware

· Data breaches or fraud due to attacks or through reverse engineering; · Damages to your company's reputation and bottom line, resulting from private information being leaked; and · Regulatory fines resulting from not being compliant or because of a breach.

The biggest hurdle for enterprises today is having to work with a highly fragmented set of point solutions that provide limited-to-no visibility into real-world risks, threats, and attacks.
