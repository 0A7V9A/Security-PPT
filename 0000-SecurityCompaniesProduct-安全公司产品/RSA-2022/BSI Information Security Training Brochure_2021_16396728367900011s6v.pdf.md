Information Security Training

Information security is critical to the operation and survival of every organization across all business sectors. ISO/IEC 27001:2013 is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (ISMS). This standard is designed to ensure that the appropriate security structures are in place to protect an organization's people, products, and proprietary information. BSI also provides training solutions on information security frameworks that will help your organization to define policies and procedures around the implementation and ongoing management of information security controls.
Note: We can provide training on the specific controls within ISO/IEC 27000-series based on the needs of your organization.
