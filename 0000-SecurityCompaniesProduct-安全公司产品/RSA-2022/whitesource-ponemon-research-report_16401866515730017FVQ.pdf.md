Reducing Enterprise Application Security Risks: More Work Needs to Be Done
Ponemon Institute, February 2021

Part 1. Introduction

Reducing Enterprise Application Security Risks: More Work Needs to Be Done examines the reasons why the highest level of security risk is considered by many to be in the application layer. In 2015, we conducted a similar study on application security risks.1 As shown in this research, since the previous study more organizations are concerned about hacks to insecure applications.

Ponemon Institute, with sponsorship from WhiteSource Software surveyed 634 IT and IT security practitioners who are familiar with their organizations' approach to securing applications. More than half (58 percent) of respondents are in organizations with a headcount greater than 5,000. As part of their responsibilities, most (45 percent of respondents) are engaged in testing applications and securing applications and data (41 percent of respondents).

For purposes of this study, enterprise application security refers to the protection of applications from external attacks, privilege abuse and data theft. According to the study, application security is difficult because current solutions don't enable a quick remediation of vulnerable applications and a high false positive rate.
Most organizations, according to Figure 1, still find it difficult to monitor, detect and prevent attacks at the application level and 71 percent of respondents say just in the past year their organizations' portfolio of applications has become more vulnerable to attack.

Based on the research, following are the reasons why business-critical applications continue to be at risk and why more work needs to be done.

§ There is an inability to quickly perform patches on applications in production. Fifty-eight respondents say it takes days, weeks and months to shore up an application in production mode after detection of a vulnerability.

§ There is an inability to quickly detect vulnerabilities and threats, according to 57 percent of respondents.

§ There is limited or no collaboration between the application development and security teams, according to 65 percent of respondents.

§ Security is not adequately emphasized during the development of new applications, according to 50 percent of respondents.

§ Despite a lower level of risk, more funds are allocated to protect networks. Thirty-eight percent of respondents say the level of risk in the application layer is high but only 17 percent of the IT security is allocated to application security.
§ Since 2015, fewer organizations are building security features into applications under development. In 2020 only 21 percent of respondents say their organizations build security features into applications, a significant decrease from 32 percent of respondents in 2015.
§ Since 2015, most organizations still do not emphasize security in the development of new applications. Only 43 percent of respondents say their organizations are making it a point to ensure security is emphasized in the development of new applications. This is a very slight increase from 39 percent of respondents five years ago.

Part 2. Key findings
In this section, we discuss the detailed findings. The complete audited findings are presented in the appendix of this report. Whenever possible the comparison between the 2015 and 2020 results will be presented. The research is organized into the following topics:
§ Why applications are more vulnerable to attack than other areas of vulnerabilities § Addressing vulnerabilities in enterprise applications § Best practices of high performing organizations in reducing the application security risk
Why applications are more vulnerable to attack than other areas of vulnerabilities
Hundreds of deployed applications are considered business critical and at risk. At any one point in time, an average of 2,672 business applications are deployed within the organizations represented in this research and 30 percent of these applications are considered business critical.
On a positive note, more organizations are making the protection of applications a top security objective. As shown in Figure 2, there was an increase from 45 percent of respondents in 2015 to 59 percent of respondents in 2020 who agree that the protection of applications is a priority. Further, more respondents believe their organizations are taking appropriate steps to ensure security during the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) and achieving compliance with leading standards and guidelines for application security such as OWASP.

It takes too long to shore up an application in production mode after detection of a vulnerability. As shown in Figure 4, 58 percent of respondents say it can take days, weeks or months to shore up an application in production mode after the detection of a vulnerability. This is a slight decrease from 2015 (63 percent of respondents).

Despite a lower level of risk, more funds are allocated to protect networks. An average of 32 percent of the overall IT budget is dedicated to data protection and security. Figure 6 shows the level of risk and the level of annual spending for each of the following five layers: applications, endpoints, networks, data and servers and the level of annual spending (investment) in IT security to these same areas.

As shown in Figure 6, 38 percent of respondents say the level of risk is high but only 17 percent of the data protection and security budget is allocated to application security. In contrast, only 20 percent of respondents rate network risk as high but 38 percent of the budget is designated for network security.

Addressing vulnerabilities in enterprise applications
More organizations need to establish a formal structured approach to their SSDLC. As discussed previously, the majority of organizations represented in this research (51 percent of respondents) take steps to ensure security in the SSDLC2. However, more work needs to be done to formalize organizations' approach to their SSDLC to improve application security.
While 33 percent of respondents say their organizations have a formal structured approach applied consistently across the enterprise, an increase from 19 percent in 2015. However, according to Figure 7, almost half (47 percent) of respondents only have an informal, ad hoc approach or no approach to the SSDLC.

Figure 8 presents the five phases in the application development process. Respondents were asked to estimate the average number of hours it takes to remediate a vulnerability once it is detected in each of the five phases. As shown, the average number of hours steadily increases the later in the process the vulnerability is detected from 6.17 hours in the architecture phase to 9.42 hours once the application is released.

Collaboration between development and security teams remains poor. As a possible reason for the failure to address security in the development of new applications is the poor collaboration between the application development and security teams. According to Figure 11, 65 percent of respondents say such collaboration is limited (29 percent) or non-existent (36 percent). In 2015, 68 percent of respondents say such collaboration is poor.

Organizations continue to have difficulties in remediating vulnerabilities in applications. In 2020, 67 percent of respondents say it is very difficult or difficult to remediate vulnerabilities in applications. According to Figure 12, In 2015 and 2020, the top two difficulties are the inability to quickly perform patches on applications in production and the inability to quickly detect vulnerabilities and threats. More organizations are confident about the ability to have qualified personnel.

Vulnerability backlogs have increased significantly, and current solutions are slow to remediate vulnerable applications. As shown in Figure 13, 63 percent of respondents say their organizations have a vulnerability backlog of applications that have been identified as vulnerable but not remediated, a significant increase from 51 percent in 2015. An average of 51 percent of vulnerable applications have not been remediated, an increase from an average of 45 percent in 2015.

Organizations are at risk because of the number of vulnerabilities that are not remediated. As discussed previously, on average, more than half (51 percent) of vulnerabilities were not remediated in the past 12 months. As shown in Figure 15, almost one-third of respondents say all vulnerabilities in the backlog are not completely remediated. Only 7 percent of respondents say the backlog is remediated within a week.

Best practices of high performing organizations in reducing application security risk
In this section, we compare the findings of organizations with characteristics that indicate they are more effective than the overall sample of respondents in reducing application security risks. We refer to these organizations as high performers. These organizations take the following steps.
§ Establish a formal structured approach to the SSDLC that is applied consistently across the enterprise.
§ Ensure the SSDLC builds security features in the design and development phase.
§ The development and security teams collaborate to ensure the mitigation of application security risk.
High performers are more likely to make the protection of applications a priority. As shown in Figure 16, high performers are less likely to consider it difficult to monitor, detect and prevent attacks at the application level. Possible reasons are that high performing organizations make application security a priority and action is taken to ensure security during the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC).

Part 4. Caveats to this study
There are inherent limitations to survey research that need to be carefully considered before drawing inferences from findings. The following items are specific limitations that are germane to most web-based surveys.
< Non-response bias: The current findings are based on a sample of survey returns. We sent surveys to a representative sample of individuals, resulting in a large number of usable returned responses. Despite non-response tests, it is always possible that individuals who did not participate are substantially different in terms of underlying beliefs from those who completed the instrument.
< Sampling-frame bias: The accuracy is based on contact information and the degree to which the list is representative of individuals who are IT or IT security practitioners located in the United States. We also acknowledge that the results may be biased by external events such as media coverage. Finally, because we used a web-based collection method, it is possible that non-web responses by mailed survey or telephone call would result in a different pattern of findings.
< Self-reported results: The quality of survey research is based on the integrity of confidential responses received from subjects. While certain checks and balances can be incorporated into the survey process, there is always the possibility that a subject did not provide accurate responses.
