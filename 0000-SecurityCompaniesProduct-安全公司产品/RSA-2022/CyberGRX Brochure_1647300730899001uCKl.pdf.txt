Reducing Cyber Risk for Organizations Worldwide
The only third-party cyber risk management (TPCRM) solution security professionals need to confidently act on third-party cybersecurity risks
TPCRM is a critical component to any organization's cyber security. Unfortunately, many third-party security programs are plagued with outdated and inefficient processes that drain resources and provide little insight. As third-party related breaches continue to increase, it's time to apply a modern approach to cyber risk management.
The CyberGRX Exchange is a central hub where enterprises and third parties can easily access, order, and share risk data. The Exchange replaces static spreadsheets with dynamic data, so enterprises always have the most current view of third-party risk and can manage it with speed and certainty. CyberGRX gives you a prioritized risk map of your entire vendor population and delivers validated risk assessments on any vendor
Working with industry leaders like Aetna, ADP, Blackstone, Mass Mutual and others, we have the world's largest cyber risk exchange with over 100,000 participants. Because of the dynamic and scalable nature of the Exchange, organizations and third parties work together in a one-to-many fashion to crowdsource data, insights, and remediation strategies. Rich with validated data and analytics, the CyberGRX Exchange is where organizations go to identify, prioritize, monitor, and reduce third-party risk.

CyberGRX Platform Overview
The CyberGRX Approach to Reducing Risk
Third-party cyber risk management is more than just assessments and security ratings. With proven results, leadership can be confident that the best TPCRM solution is protecting the organization.
The CyberGRX solution integrates advanced analytics, threat intelligence, and sophisticated risk models, based on known breach kill chains, with the vendor's responses. It provides an in-depth view of how a vendor's security controls will protect against potential threats. Threat use cases are built on MITRE tactics and techniques that streamline curation, reuse, and modularity, so customers will have better integration with providers who also build upon the framework.
Our Framework Mapper feature maps to most customer controls as well as industry standards and frameworks such as NIST ­800.53, NIST-CSF, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc. It takes standard data as input and produces custom output across many custom and industry framework controls to quickly and easily provide risk identification, visibility, and reduction.
Reduce risk the CyberGRX way:

Organize Work with a structured and standardized data set that allows you to run analytics across it and prioritize risk

Benchmarking Compare individual vendors or entire populations to others on the exchange for benchmarking and risk reducing insights

Strategize Create a remediation strategy with the most yield leveraging security gap and benchmarking insights

Protect Feel confident in your understanding of how your third parties are managing privacy in respect to the major privacy regulations
