PRODUCT OVERVIEW

INTRODUCING CODE42 INCYDR

Data Risk Detection and Response for Insider Risk
The IncydrTM SaaS product protects all of your valuable IP and strategic files such as source code, customer lists and product roadmaps without overwhelming security teams or inhibiting employee productivity. With unrivaled simplicity, signal and speed, Incydr brings together three dimensions of risk to quickly and accurately detect and respond to insider threat.

FILE

Monitors all files ­ not just those that have been deemed sensitive
Offers critical metadata including file name, owner, size, path, category and hash
Provides authorized security analysts with the ability to review file content

VECTOR

Detects exposure and exfiltration including web browser uploads, cloud sync activity, file sharing, Airdrop, and removable media
Filters file events to reflect what is considered trusted vs untrusted activity
Provides vector detail like sync username, domain name, browser tab title and URL, and removable media make, model, volume name, partition ID and serial number

USER

Identifies behavioral risk indicators such as remote activity, off-hour file events and attempts to conceal exfiltration
Allows security teams to programmatically monitor users with increased risk factors, such as departing and contract employees
Provides 90 days of historical user activity to surface trends and abnormalities

More collaboration, more insider risk.
Organizations are moving faster than ever before. New IP is created every second, in the cloud using collaboration tools. Employees are being onboarded, enabled, empowered and offboarded, all in a remote world. Your security team needs to keep up with these risks, while remaining compliant, and enabling the business. Security tools like DLP, UEBA and CASB typically address a single dimension of risk, take months to deploy, and burden security teams with constant fine-tuning. It's time for a new approach to managing and mitigating data risk from insider threats.
89% of CISOs believe a fast-paced collaborative culture creates great risk.
66% of data breaches involve an insider.
69% of organizations breached by insider threat had a DLP solution in place.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY
"If it wasn't for the Code42 ability to actually see the files, we wouldn't really understand what the person is doing... It provides us both speed and thoroughness of investigations."
­ Tim Briggs, Director of Incident Response and eDiscovery at CrowdStrike
"It's crucial that we are able to detect and respond if employees are transferring data to personal accounts, or publicly sharing documents, especially when they depart. The Code42-Box integration gives us quick visibility into what is shared outside of our domain."
­ Mark Campbell, Senior Director at Xactly
"Code42 is the only solution we have found that gives us the visibility we need to understand where data is moving, while still letting our team work how ­ and where ­ they need to."
­ Dustin Fritz, Sr. Security Architect at UserTesting
