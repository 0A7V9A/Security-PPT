Traditional endpoint security is losing the battle with advanced ransomware and malware. In 2020 the average total cost of a data breach was $3.86 million USD. In 2021 ransomware attacks caused an average of $1.85 million USD damage to affected companies, with only 8% receiving all their data back even when paying the ransom. Corporate endpoints such as servers, laptops, desktops, and critical point of sales (POS) systems are often targeted to gain access to valuable network assets. These attacks persist even though most organizations have installed some form of traditional endpoint security controls. Endpoints are the most common and easiest way for ransomware and malware to enter your network.
Traditional security controls rely on signature-based techniques to detect known threats, utilizing signature database files accompanied by continuous scans to remove infected files. These traditional solutions are CPU-intensive, require constant connectivity, frequent updates, and are ineffective against file-less attacks. The newer generation of endpoint detection and response (EDR) security tools that combat file-less attacks are also network and data intensive. EDR tools function by recording every single activity at each endpoint, resulting in alert fatigue for analysts in security operations centers (SOC) and compromising an organization's security.
As part of the ColorTokens Xtended ZeroTrustTM cloud-delivered, software-defined platform, ColorTokens Xprotect utilizes a proactive Zero Trust architecture to provide complete processlevel control for endpoints. In a Zero Trust architecture only good behavior is allowed and any deviations from normal behavior are automatically blocked. Xprotect is designed with intelligent algorithms for in-depth analysis of every running process and file present in the endpoint system. The running processes are analyzed with the known good processes and combined with contextual behavioral analysis to detect and stop suspicious activity. Xprotect enables businesses to easily deploy and manage endpoint security from the cloud-hosted console, providing real business value in minutes.

Centralized Web-Based Console

""We chose to work with ColorTokens because of its commitment to simplifying our security operations and its minimally invasive, cloud-delivered approach to our infrastructure and team. Implementation was seamless from start to finish: we deployed ColorTokens' lightweight agents on our 700 systems, and got up and running with minimal configuration and no disruption or redesign. This was of critical importance to us, as it allowed us to continue our customer service business without skipping a beat."
­ Uday Inamdar, CEO, ITCube Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Xprotect Agent

Xprotect Dashboard: A centralized, web-based console provides full visibility and control of all assets in the network and processes running on every machine. The intuitive dashboard helps security professionals quickly view connectivity status with the tenant, agent status, and alerts. The multi-tenant dashboard provides key indicators and list widgets that display each tenant's critical metrics and the level of threat observed on the tenant's hosts.
Xprotect Agent: Ultra-lightweight software agents are installed on endpoints. The agent contains built-in rules and configuration information, and incident logs are correlated within the agent. This architecture allows for offline protection of the endpoints, as the Xprotect agent has predefined security rules. Once the endpoint is back online, it sends all the telemetry data to the dashboard.

Xprotect Features & Benefits

Features
Granular Process-Level Control Whitelisting & Blacklisting Freeze Mode Rule Rings
File Protect USB Control Security Incident Management Agent Proxy Auto-Scale User-Based Policies RBAC Audit Logs

Benefits
Allows administrators to dictate behavior at the process level for parent and child processes. Also provides visibility and the ability to lock down an endpoint at the process level.
Whitelist and/or blacklist known-good and known-bad processes based on behavior, path, or MD5 to prevent zero-day attacks, file-less malware, and unknown threats.
Tamper-proof endpoints, fixed-function devices, and legacy systems with a combination of whitelist, blacklist, and block modes to create a Zero Trust environment.
Contextual behavioral rules allow the administrator to dictate behaviors for processes, including parent and child process behavior, network behavior visibility, and the ability to lock down an endpoint at the process level.
Safeguard data by controlling process-level access to specific files or file types based on extension, directory, or path. As an example, only MS Word can be used to open word documents.
Control USB access at the kernel level to make sure even system-level admin rights cannot bypass the enforced set of controls.
Fast query language (FQL) drastically simplifies the search and analysis of security incidents for IRC and SOC teams.
Agent proxy can be set up on a virtual machine, so that communication between air-gapped systems and ColorTokens security cloud can be routed via internal networks instead of the internet.
Eliminate manual handling of suspended instances in an auto-scale environment; users can enable autodelete and configure the time for deleting instances, leading to more optimized use of resources.
Host-based policies give the ability to assign policies based on the current user logged in to the endpoint. This allows identity-based security settings for multiple users accessing the same endpoint machine.
Role-based Access Control - Instance Admin, Policy Manager, Asset Manager, and Read-Only Admin is available for separation of duties when accessing Xprotect features.
Keeps track of all operations performed via the Xprotect cloud dashboard, with detailed insights on who did what, and when, along with operation-related metadata. This is a must-have for compliance purposes.

Key Use Cases

Protect Fixed-Function Devices

Challenge
Point of sale (POS) and fixed-function retail systems have low memory, CPU, and storage, with typically low bandwidth connections. Traditional signaturebased AV tools have a massive footprint, and EDR tools are bandwidth-hungry. These tools can often disrupt business and compromise the security of fixedfunction devices.

ColorTokens Solution
Xaccess enables role- and identity-based secure access to distributed applications, cloud services, and workload segments across any public cloud, hybrid cloud, or data center with zero-complexity deployment and operations. The solution is software-defined, seamless across environments, and makes it easy to define and manage policies at scale across clouds. It is the only remote access solution that is integrated with workload-to-workload segmentation for maximum security of applications and services being accessed by internal and external users.

Endpoint Lockdown
Challenge
Businesses today want to control what runs on their fragmented endpoints for security and compliance reasons. However, legacy endpoint protection solutions can be cumbersome to implement, are very limiting in scope, and lead to business disruption.

ColorTokens Solution
ColorTokens Xprotect takes a Zero Trust approach to endpoint protection where only good application behavior is allowed, and any deviations from normal behavior are not allowed. The running processes are analyzed with the whitelisted processes and combined with contextual behavioral analysis to protect from advanced malware, ransomware, file-less attacks, and zero-day or unknown threats.

Ransomware Prevention
Challenge
Ransomware has been wreaking havoc on enterprises in recent years. Since 2017, the number of ransomware variants has quadrupled. Businesses and government agencies are all struggling to thwart ransomware attacks. These attacks are increasingly becoming more successful, rewarding, and challenging to track, causing substantial financial and brand damage to corporations.

ColorTokens Solution
ColorTokens Xprotect delivers real-time protection against ransomware, preventing attacks from becoming large-scale and costly corporate incidents. Xprotect effectively reduces the attack surface on an endpoint, contains and prevents the lateral spread by locking down the endpoint, and efficiently stops ransomware attacks by visualizing, intervening, and blocking unauthorized and malicious behavior during the ransomware attack phases.
