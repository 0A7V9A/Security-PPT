Training Success Stories
"I attended (ISC)²'s CISSP training and highly recommend it to others studying for the exam. The instructor's knowledge allows you to focus on what's really important and rationalize difficult subjects. Training is very comprehensive, covering a great deal of material with both depth and clarity."
Carlo Brantly, Director of IT
"I chose (ISC)² for CISSP training because of their impeccable reputation and standards. My instructor was able to tie reallife scenarios into the course material, and learning was further enhanced by different IT experiences of fellow classmates."
Corley S. Bradford, Jr., Cyber Planner
"I attended (ISC)²'s SSCP CBK training and would definitely recommend this to others preparing for the exam. I found the discussions and diagramming to be especially helpful in better understanding what is portrayed in the books. Personalizing the scenarios during the training made the information much easier to recall during the exam."

7Tips for Success Proreckpayroeutro exam!

1 Get familiar with the exam The exam outline is a great place to start. It's a free resource that details the major topics and subtopics within the domains you will be tested on.
2 Develop your plan Commit to an exam date early. This can help you stay motivated and work backwards as you create a study schedule. Stick to a routine by blocking study time on your calendar each day.
3 Invest in study materials Take advantage of the many self-study resources available. (ISC)² offers several options to suit your study needs.
4 Refresh knowledge through training Once you've built a foundation through self-study, expand that knowledge through Official (ISC)² CBK Training. Whether you are a hands-on learner or prefer to learn at your own pace online, we have a training solution for you.

5 Brush up on less familiar topics After your training, think about the topics covered. Were there any areas where you could improve? Refer to your study materials and review those domains more closely as you continue to prepare.
