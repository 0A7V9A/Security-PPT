BLIND SPOTS CAN MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION VULNERABLE Traditional enterprise endpoint security tools have blind spots, making them unable to see and stop advanced threats on laptops, desktops, tablets, servers and mobile devices. Many organizations are turning to next generation Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions that offer more capabilities than traditional antivirus solutions to detect and prevent cyber-attacks. These next-generation endpoint security solutions also enable faster response times to a security incident or breach. However, they can be time-consuming and costly to deploy and manage. They require EDR expertise, and the ability to respond to threats quickly, if they make it through defenses.

PROTECT END USERS AND DEVICES
We've built endpoint security monitoring capabilities at Motorola Solutions as part of our Advanced Threat Detection and Response Services to ensure you get optimal benefit from EDR and show ROI quickly. We integrate several EDR next-generation solutions into our ActiveEyeSM platform, including Carbon Black, CrowdStrike and Sophos.

This gives you and our Security Operations Center (SOC) the ability to investigate and respond to threats from a centralized management console. The cost is typically less than you would pay to staff and train even one cybersecurity expert. Plus, you'll get a whole team with broad expertise responding to threats 24/7 to improve your overall security program.

CONTINUOUS THREAT MONITORING
ActiveEye continuously monitors all endpoint activity and analyzes the data in real time to automatically identify threat activity, enabling it to both detect and prevent advanced threats as they happen. All activity is visible in the ActiveEye platform so your security team can rapidly investigate incidents, respond to alerts and proactively hunt for new threats. In addition, this activity can be correlated with activity and alerts from your network, as well as cloud applications and infrastructure, offering a comprehensive view of your security environment to detect and respond to those threats even faster.
