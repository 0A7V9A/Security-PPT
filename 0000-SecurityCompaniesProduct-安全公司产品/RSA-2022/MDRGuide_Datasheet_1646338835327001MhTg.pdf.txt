How Red Canary MDR Works

Red Canary analyzes endpoint telemetry with our cloud-based detection engine composed of thousands of evolving behavioral analytic use cases. These use cases surface potential threats to the Red Canary Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) via our proprietary analyst workbench. Once a threat is confirmed, you can view it in your Red Canary Portal and configure any response actions using automation.

OUR TECHNOLOGIES
AN API-FIRST ARCHITECTURE Red Canary integrates with the tools and workflows you already have in place. You can access detailed threat data for use in ticketing systems, SIEMs, Slack, SMS, and more.

OUR TEAMS
THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH Industry veterans perform threat research and analyze intelligence to ensure your coverage for attacker behaviors evolves with new information.

A DETECTION ENGINE THAT SCALES AUTOMATICALLY
Our detection engine processes petabytes of endpoint telemetry per day and scales automatically. When a potential threat is uncovered, the engine forwards it to our analyst workbench for investigation.

CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM (CIRT)
Expert detection engineers investigate threats 24/7/365. They remove false positives, classify confirmed threats, and deliver an event timeline with the context you need to take action.

AN ANALYST WORKBENCH THAT DRIVES EFFICIENCY
A typical SOC analyst performs 10-20 investigations per day. Thanks to our proprietary analyst workbench, we're able to perform hundreds--enabling broader, more precise detection coverage.

INCIDENT HANDLING
Your Incident Handler is here for on-call IR support and ongoing security advice. Get proactive guidance on security architecture, engineering, or overall strategy.
