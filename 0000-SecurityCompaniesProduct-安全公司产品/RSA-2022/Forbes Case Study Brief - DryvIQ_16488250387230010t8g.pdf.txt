Forbes Completes Successful Google Migration in 10 Days
Business Profile
Forbes is a global media brand known for its bi-weekly business magazine. The organization champions entrepreneurial success by convening and curating influential leaders who are driving change, transforming business, and making a significant impact on the world. Forbes reaches 120 million people worldwide through its print product, live events, and marketing programs across 70 countries.
The Challenge
By the time Forbes decided to eliminate their extra cloud storage platform, they had just under three months to move their content or risk paying for a renewal. Forbes initially employed a DIY migration method: manually downloading their files from the original cloud platform and reuploading them to Google. However, it did not take long for Forbes to realize that this do-ityourself migration approach was not ideal. With their migration deadline looming, Forbes decided to rethink their approach to their Google migration.
"We didn't think the migration would be too difficult for us to manage, so at first our IT team decided to try and move the content ourselves. The very first folder we attempted to migrate took us about two weeks. We knew at that point that there was no way we were going to get our migration done on time." - Chris LaBianca, Director of Business Systems

"For us, the biggest drivers behind this project were speed and ensuring that our file structures stayed the same so that our employees did not have any issues with the transition.
We were shocked and happy that we were able to complete our Google migration on deadline. The DryvIQ team was incredibly responsive and truly delivered on their promise."

The Solution
Once the project launched, DryvIQ's Client Solutions team kicked it into high gear to deploy the software and migrate the content to Google quickly and transparently. Because Dryv streams files directly from the source to the destination, there was no downloading and reuploading of the content required, and the platform preserved all file fidelity and user information in the migration.

Short-term Goals:
Complete migration project in three months Maintain file fidelity

Long-term Goals:
Enable employee collaboration Save on cloud storage costs Eliminate redundancy

The Results
Migrated 15TB of content and 325 users
Consolidated organization to Google for collaboration and storage
Completed large migration in just 10 days
With the help of Dryv, Forbes was able to easily migrate its 325 users and 15TB of content to Google in 10 days ­ avoiding costly renewal fees and user disruption. Now everyone in the organization can collaborate seamlessly with Google Workspace.
