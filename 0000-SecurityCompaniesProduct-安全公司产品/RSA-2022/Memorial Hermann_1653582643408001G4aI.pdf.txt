Onspring Case Study: Memorial Hermann HIPAA Audit Risk Management

HIPAA Audit Risk Management
A Healthcare Case Study

OVERVIEW
With a goal of creating an efficient, consistent, and adaptable HIPAA audit risk management program, the Memorial Hermann Health Systems audit team dropped their legacy software and adopted Onspring.
Now able to simultaneously manage OCR compliance, HIPAA compliance, and report on privacy incidents, all under the HITRUST and NIST frameworks, the audit team had a HIPAA audit risk management program fully connected to the rest of the business.
"Onspring really helps us understand what our primary risks are, and not only in the types of problems but specifically where they exist in our environment."
