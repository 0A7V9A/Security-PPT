GET COMPLETE VISIBILITY INTO YOUR SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
Our ActiveEye platform powers Motorola Solutions managed cybersecurity services, enabling the deployment Managed Detection and Response (MDR) capabilities across your organization. Easily integrating with the systems and tools you already use, ActiveEye uses advanced automation to eliminate the noise from millions of cyber events, allowing our experienced Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts or your internal security team to focus on actual threats to resolve them faster. With a transparent, co-managed view, you can see what our SOC analysts see and what actions have been taken to protect your vital assets.

BUILD CYBERSECURITY READINESS WITHOUT BUILDING A SOC

Cyber threats are evolving faster than ever. Add in cloud infrastructure and SaaS applications, and the cybersecurity skills you need to have at the ready are complex and difficult to find. Few organizations have the budget and resources to maintain expensive, noisy security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, or to build and staff their own 24/7 SOC capable of investigation and incident response around the clock.

That's where Motorola Solutions can help. Our ActiveEye platform learns who and what is attacking your organization, building a threat database that analysts can also add to manually. Advanced machine learning uses this data to detect anomalous behavior that can signal account takeover or insider threats. Our SOCs are staffed 24/7 by cybersecurity experts with a broad set of skills and platform knowledge.

SOLUTION BRIEF | ACTIVEEYE MANAGED DETECTION AND RESPONSE

GET VISIBILITY INTO IT NETWORKS, ENDPOINTS, CLOUD AND MORE
ActiveEye integrates with and monitors Motorola Solutions systems such as ASTRO, VESTA 9-1-1, PremierOne, Flex and more. It can also help you meet compliance requirements and detect IT network threats with security monitoring, log retention, advanced reporting and threat intelligence, and protect workstations and mobile devices with advanced Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for rapid threat detection, asset discovery, traffic analysis and log collection. Whether it's Office 365, Google Workspace, AWS or Azure, ActiveEye protects assets as you move to the cloud applications, too, monitoring configuration settings and network anomalies to keep SaaS accounts and cloud infrastructure safe.
EVALUATE ACTUAL VERSUS PERCEIVED THREATS
All alerts are not created equal. ActiveEye uses advanced automation to filter out more than 95 percent of false alerts, and to rank order the remaining alerts, so our SOC analysts are focused on the highest risks. Activities that start with a low urgency score can quickly increase as the virtual analyst capabilities within ActiveEye evaluate current context and how the SOC handled similar situations in the past.
RESPOND FASTER WITH INTERACTIVE INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS
ActiveEye puts a simple, intuitive investigation capability at the fingertips of even non-security experts, enabling you to see related alerts, whether they're open or closed. With ActiveEye, you get the same visibility into what's happening in your environment that our SOC analysts have.
EASILY DEFINE AND VIEW KEY METRICS
Be sure your staffing level is appropriate and effective while knowing when and where to grow, or leave it to our SOC to manage so you can have peace of mind knowing that key performance indicators for your systems, networks and applications are being monitored 24/7 by our team of experts.
