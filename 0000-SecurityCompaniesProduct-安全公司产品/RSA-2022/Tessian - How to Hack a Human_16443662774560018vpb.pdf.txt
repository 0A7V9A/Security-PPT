Introduction
Over the last decade, phishing - a type of social engineering attack - has transformed from something more like spam to the threat most likely to cause a breach.
During that same period, the number of adults on social media platforms like Facebook increased by almost 1,300%.
Every photo we post, status we update, person we tag, and place we check into reveals valuable information about our personal and professional lives. And hackers use this information to craft targeted - and effective - social engineering attacks at scale.
In this report, we explore how hackers hack humans and businesses by exploiting two key vulnerabilities:  The average person shares a lot of information online  The average person isn't a security expert

The social network
Our digital footprints are bigger than ever¹.
There are over: 2,701,000,000 users on Facebook 1,158,000,000 users on Instagram 722,000,000 users on LinkedIn 353,000,000 users on Twitter
It shouldn't surprise you that 90% of people post information related to their personal and professional lives online.
This number is even higher among 18-34 year olds, according to our survey results. And, across LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook, 55% of people have publicly visible accounts.
When an account is public, anyone can see the information you post online, whether it's a photo of your boarding pass, or a birthday shout-out to a colleague.
Harmless, right? Unfortunately not.

This information is gold dust to hackers and makes reconnaissance impossibly easy.
Take the former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. He posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram². From the booking reference, hackers found his passport number and phone number - information that could have helped them gain access to other accounts, including sensitive personal and government information.
It didn't take much work. According to one of the hackers involved, "Anyone who saw that Instagram post could also have [his passport number and phone number]."
Mr. Abbott isn't the only person who posts this kind of information online...

32% of employees post business travel photos and updates. Nearly 72% mention birthday celebrations. 36% share information about their jobs. And don't forget about all the information we share about our pets, partners, and children.
Hackers use all of it. Yep, even that photo of your pup.
Did you know? JPEG files contain 'EXIF' data that can include accurate GPS locations of where the photo was taken. Many apps strip this data out before the photo goes online, but not all.

Hackers hack humans to hack the companies they work for

To understand exactly how hackers leverage all of this information, we have to look at a social engineering attack from start to finish.

From there, they'll research supply chains and vendors, study company org. charts, map employee relationships, and monitor individual behavior. And, by running scripts, they can do this automatically and at scale.

First, a hacker identifies a target organization.
Depending on their motivations, they could choose an asset management firm with hopes of initiating a wire transfer or a pharmaceutical company with hopes of getting their hands on R&D.

Why do all this reconnaissance? To pinpoint potential entry points, identify viable third-parties to impersonate, and to collect information (however subtle) that'll help them nudge their targets towards unconscious (and conscious) confirmation and eventually - trust and compliance.

"Hackers start by looking for vulnerabilities. Not necessarily exploits but vulnerabilities. Today, those vulnerabilities are people."
ALON GAL
Co-Founder & CTO, Hudson Rock

Remember
Hackers hack humans to hack the companies they work for. And a lot of the heaving lifting can be done on social media.

While behavior varies by region, most of us eagerly announce when we start a new job. In the US, almost everyone does - with 93% of employees in the US saying they update their job status on social media.
We share press releases about new clients and mergers and acquisitions. We post photos of our employee IDs and screenshots of Zoom calls. We tag our colleagues and customers in our updates and comment on theirs.
We share all of this information regularly.
Almost half (43%) of us post every day, giving hackers up-to-date intelligence about where we're working, who we're working with, and what we're working on.

In this example of a social engineering attack, hackers use an OOO message and other publicly available information to initiate a wire transfer.
Type of Attack: CEO/CXO Fraud Industry: Financial Services Hacker Motivation: (Quick) Financial Gain
 The hacker group monitors news wires for up-to-date information about banks in the United States to find their target, an asset management firm called SoBank.
 They see that the company's CFO - Andrew Neal - is OOO at a conference.
 Thanks to his OOO message, they're able to identify their target, Tristan Porter. They also learn that Andrew goes by "Andy" at work.
 The hacker group sends a fabricated email chain that appears to be between Andy and Gregory Ellwood, Senior Partner at Dorling Clayton - SoBank's advising firm urging Tristan to make a wire transfer.

This time, hackers leverage a trusted third-party to gain access to their target.
Type of Attack: Account Takeover Industry: Healthcare Hacker Motivation: (Long-game) Intellectual Property



Attack-2_Target.jpg



Warning:

New starters are prime targets of social

engineering attacks. They're typically



given their full access credentials when they start, but don't yet know who's

who. They may also not have had their

security training yet. Finally, given that

they're new, they'll be especially keen to

make a good impression.

The hacker group has been monitoring news wires  and eventually zeros-in on their target, Accord Pharma,
a pharmaceutical company, after reading a press release.
To gain access to Accord, they first target employees  of Accord's consultancy firm, Initech.
They identify a new starter at the consultancy firm, Lily,  and target her with credential phishing. The email is
carefully crafted with the knowledge that the firm uses Outlook - thanks to Lily's post on LinkedIn - and leads users to a fake Outlook login page.
Lily falls for the attack, giving the hacker access to

her email account
Once in, the hacker can email employees at the pharma  company as Lily without raising any suspicions. That means
the hacker could...
 Embed malware into an attachment or link  Build rapport with employees  Silently gather information  Phish for more credentials

Not-so-strong passwords
When it comes to Business Email Compromise, information related to your professional life is important. But your personal information can be just as valuable.
Hackers can use information about your pets, partner, children, and even your interests to crack passwords and answer security questions, giving them full access to personal and work accounts, including password managers and even your email.
Don't believe us? 21% of people³ use information like their favorite football team, their pet's name, or birthdays when creating passwords and some of the most common security questions include: What is your mother's maiden name? What was your first car? What elementary school did you attend? What year were you married?
This is all readily available online. 34% of people share the names of their pets, 34% mention their children/partner, and 40% share information about their interests.
People may even unwittingly share this information via gimmicks or memes that make their rounds on social media. For example, "name generators" that ask you to combine your pet's name with your childhood street address. Sound familiar?

A hacker's toolkit
While all of this information is easy enough to find - especially if you're motivated to find it - there are plenty of tools that hackers use to connect the dots and crack passwords.
Most - if not all - of these tools were designed for the "good guys". Penetration testers, compliance teams, and even law enforcement. In fact, some are even marketing and sales tools!
These sorts of tools are bundled together and available for free via Kali Linux.
"Believe me, hackers are willing to try 24/7. They have nothing but time. This is something businesses don't have. An employee working 9-5 just doesn't have the same commitment to protecting a company as a hacker has to hacking a company. That means hackers have a big advantage here."

We're not all security experts
The problem isn't just that we share a lot of information online. It's also the fact that, well... security isn't top of mind for most people.
According to our survey, only 15% of employees don't reuse passwords.
And, while 64% of employees do have multi-factor authentication in place at work, hackers can (and do) work around these authentication mechanisms.
Most of us might shrug off a weak (or re-used) password, but it's big business for hackers. A recent example? Hackers gained unauthorized access to SolarWinds by guessing passwords.
But guessing passwords isn't the only way hackers can gain access to an account. Credentials are the #1 type of data comprised in phishing attacks, most often delivered via email.

Which of the following do you inspect before responding to an email or actioning a request?
"Hackers are very strategic in the timing of their social engineering attacks. It's very similar to marketing. Mailchimp and SendGrid publish reports about the most effective times of day to send emails... the same rules apply for phishing."
CRAIG HAYS Ethical Hacker

At work, just 54% of people report paying attention to the sender's email address and less than half check the legitimacy of links (44%) and attachments (47%) before responding or actioning a request.
And, as several ethical hackers pointed out, people are even less likely to exercise caution when replying on a mobile phone or during out-of-office hours, making it easier for hackers to dupe their targets.
And this doesn't even account for stress, fatigue, distractions, or the pressure employees are under with quick-to-click cultures.
That means even unsophisticated phishing attacks might fool the average person. In that case, what chance do we have against highly targeted and carefully crafted social engineering attacks?

Does this look suspicious to you?
You could make the argument that people don't carefully inspect their incoming emails because they're most likely not being targeted by phishing or social engineering attacks. They have no need to be diligent.
Our data tells a different story.
88% of people have received a suspicious message or link in the last year. Via which channel? Most often email, followed by social media, then text message.
And some industries are receiving more suspicious messages than others. Unsurprisingly, it's those that handle the most sensitive information that are targeted most frequently.
96% of employees working in Healthcare say they received a suspicious message in 2020. 92% of employees in both Financial Services and Information Technology say the same. Across the board, email is the #1 threat vector.
This begs an important question: What are organizations doing to prevent the problem?

Many organizations rely on training to prevent social engineering attacks like CEO Fraud, Account Takeover, and Business Email Compromise. And educating employees is an incredibly important first step.
Here's a list of do's and don'ts when it comes to managing your digital footprint, following cybersecurity best practice, and spotting advanced impersonations attacks.
"For the most part, you can't stop employees from sharing information online. You also can't stop employees from clicking on links or attachments. That's the problem! It only takes one late night for someone to make a mistake. It happens to the best of us. That means it really comes down to getting them to care about the culture of security."
DAWN ISABEL Mobile Security Research Engineer at NowSecure, HackerOne Community

Cybersecurity Best Practice_Do's.doc
 Do
 Review your privacy settings on all your social media profiles. Be aware that some will share your information beyond the platform.
 Configure your OOO settings so that your message is only sent to contacts or email addresses from within your organization.
 Use strong passwords that don't include your name, birth date, pet's name, or other information that's easy to find online. Better yet, use a password manager like 1Password to randomly generate impossible-to-hack passwords.
 Enable 2FA or MFA.
 When reading emails, check that the sender's display name and email address match, especially if you're on your mobile.
 Follow in-house security policies around payment verification before actioning any requests made via email.
 Hover over links before clicking on them. If the URL looks suspicious, don't click.
 Report anything suspicious! Your security team is there to help.

Cybersecurity Best Practice_Don'ts.doc
 Don't
 Re-use passwords for professional or personal accounts.  Include too much information in an OOO message. The date of
your return is sufficient for anyone outside of your organization. Want to be proactive? Email customers/clients directly before you log off with relevant contact details for you or a colleague.  Open attachments or links from senders you don't recognize.  Post photos of your employee ID or screenshots of your laptop with work "stuff" visible. For example, your email, your desktop, Zoom Meeting IDs, browser bookmarks etc.  Be afraid to ask for a second opinion about a suspicious message.  Assume that phishing emails are poorly crafted or riddled with grammatical errors. Remember, these are sophisticated attacks designed to look exactly like the real thing.

Throughout 2020, Tessian Defender prevented nearly 420,000 social engineering attacks and over 125,000 attempts of wire fraud. And, we've seen a 15% increase in the number of attacks from the first half of the year to second. These are emails that slipped right past legacy solutions and native controls.

But employees should never be the last line of defense. That's why most organizations invest in inbound email security solutions.
Unfortunately, spam filters and Secure Email Gateways just aren't enough to prevent social engineering attacks. Why? Because these outdated solutions lack the intelligent technology needed to detect the nuanced differences between a "real" email and an expertly-crafted fake one.
"We don't hire people to be spam filters or phishing email detectors. We hire them to do other jobs. The best you can do is ask them to be vigilant and educate them, but even that isn't enough. You have to put tools in place to protect them."
CRAIG HAYS Ethical Hacker

Tessian is different.
Tessian Defender uses machine learning (ML) to protect your people from even the most advanced inbound threats.
Here's how:
 Tessian's machine learning algorithms analyze your company's email data, learn employees' normal communication patterns, and map their trusted email relationships -- both inside and outside your organization.
 Tessian inspects both the content and metadata of inbound emails for any suspicious or unusual signals pointing to a potential impersonation, ATO, or BEC threat. For example, payloads, anomalous geophysical locations, IP addresses, email clients, and sending patterns.
 Once it detects a threat, Tessian alerts employees that an email might be unsafe, explaining the threat in easy-to-understand language via an interactive notification.

Methodology
In addition to using Tessian platform data, and insights garnered from interviews with the HackerOne community and experts in social engineering, we commissioned OnePoll to survey 4,000 working professionals: 2,000 in the US and 2,000 in the UK. Survey respondents varied in age from 18-51+, occupied various roles across departments and industries, and worked within organizations ranging in size from 2-1,000+. Publically available third-party research was also used, with all sources listed on this page. Midpoints and averages were used when calculating some figures and percentages may not always add up to 100% due to rounding.
