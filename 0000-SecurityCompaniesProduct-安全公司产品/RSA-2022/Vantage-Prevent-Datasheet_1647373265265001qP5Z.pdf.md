Intelligence Directed Dynamic Application Security Testing
Organizations need an automated and an accurate way to test their applications for security vulnerabilities
Organizations need to deliver new applications and API's, fast. Unfortunately, this "need for speed" requirement can lead to vulnerabilities in software code and "At-Risk" applications. While these vulnerabilities can be identified once in production, so begins the process by which developers must stop working on new projects to fix the vulnerabilities in released applications. To not do so could open their organization up to the myriad of threats that these vulnerabilities expose. DevOps are not security experts. Nor should they be. Organizations need an automated and accurate way to test applications for security vulnerabilities earlier in the development process, one that is without cumbersome configurations or time-outs as software engineers come up to speed on security expertise.
Vantage Prevent is a revolutionary new application security testing solution
Vantage Prevent allows developers with no security domain expertise to discover and resolve vulnerabilities before they reach production. Additionally, security teams have visibility into the results which provides them with confidence on what's getting pushed into production is secure. This reduces the load and stress on the security team by reducing or eliminating the stress of finding critical vulnerabilities in production systems.
Key Features & Functionalities
 Dynamic testing completed in minutes -- not days -- everywhere throughout the SDLC  Developer-directed DAST integrates security testing with functional and QA testing  Native API testing  Language and platform agnostic  Quickly test incrementally or scan an entire application in local developer environments

VANTAGE PREVENT | DATASHEET
Intelligence Directed DAST
Leverage functional tests to shift security testing to the left.
Traditional DAST scanners can't be used in development environments due to the nature of how they work. Scanners usually crawl applications to discover (attack vectors) the targets that need to be attacked. Crawling a site takes a long time and, in most cases, is too long within development environments. Instead of crawling, Vantage Prevent uses functional tests to discover targets within the application to attack.
 Eliminates the need to crawl, resulting in scans that take minutes, not hours  Runs standalone in your development environment on Windows, Mac, or Linux  Accurate results, focusing on high impact, actionable vulnerabilities
Vantage Prevent reduces the chance for vulnerabilities to appear in production as well as ensures that development / engineering organizations adhere to security policies.
Session and Credential Manager
Automatically manages session authentication with no configuration.
 User does not have to manage credentials  Automatically detects authentication state  Supports most forms of authentication
Eliminates the hassle of managing and updating credentials within the tool.
Intelligent Attacks
Efficiently tests your system of vulnerabilities.
Traditional DAST tools take a brute force approach to testing. The downside to a brute force test is that it takes a long time. Instead of trying everything, Vantage Prevent intelligently tests just a few payloads at first. If there is an indication of a vulnerability, Vantage Prevent will try more tests.
 Only spends time attacking what is vulnerable  Covers OWASP / API Top 10  Provides detailed evidence and remediation information
Vantage Prevent provides you the ability to run faster scans that produce rapid but accurate results that results in quick resolution of vulnerabilities.

Why customers want Vantage Prevent?
Powered by its patented and revolutionary Directed-DAST technology, Vantage Prevent brings next-gen dynamic security testing to every stage of the SDLC. Vantage Prevent empowers developers with the ability to simultaneously run dynamic security scans alongside functional testing as applications are built and integrated into DevOps' CI/CD pipeline.

· Empower developers, QA, and DevOps to test for security · Does not require security subject matter expertise · Requires little to no configuration

· Performs a scan in minutes · Focuses on high impact and actionable vulnerabilities

VANTAGE PREVENT | DATASHEET

Vantage Prevent is Built to Provide
Speed
IDD scan times are measured in minutes, not hours or days. This enables security testing to be part of the CI/CD pipeline and deliver real-time vulnerability findings.
Accuracy
Focus on accuracy is incredibly important in today's DevOps world. False positives are as crucial as false negatives, and noise in a scan result can slow down the entire process. This is why evidence is included with IDD's vulnerability results.
Ease
IDD is easy to use with no dependencies and minimal configuration. It includes intelligence that automatically handles common challenges such as logins and complex session states.
Automation
Collapse the configuration paradigm by integrating cutting-edge security vulnerability testing during development.
Universal Workability
Test wherever you work. Locally, remotely, or in the cloud.
