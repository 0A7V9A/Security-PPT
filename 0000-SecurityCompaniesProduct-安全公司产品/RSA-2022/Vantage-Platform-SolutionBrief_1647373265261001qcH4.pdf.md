THE WHITEHAT VANTAGE PLATFORM | SOLUTION BRIEF

Accelerates Application Security to the Speed of Modern Development
The Vantage Platform strategically layers three lightning fast, purpose-built testing solutions at the most critical inflection points of the SDLC to empower developers, DevOps and security teams with accurate and contextual security insights as they build, run and deploy web applications and APIs. Built on top of a powerful and flexible cloud-based SaaS architecture, The Vantage Platform features a robust public API that unlocks seamless integrations with teams' existing tools to streamline workflows and automate application security throughout the entire SDLC.

Dynamically Differentiated

Adapt AppSec to All

Comprehensive Visibility

The Vantage Platform drives the future of application security by bringing next-gen dynamic testing to every stage of the SDLC -- from
development to production.

The Vantage Platform lays the foundation for enterprises to take a simplified approach to application security with three purpose-built and easy-to-use tools designed for developers, DevOps and security teams, that increases their code's quality without impeding business velocity.

The Vantage Platform brings everything together in an intuitive, centralized dashboard to give teams a comprehensive vantage into their
applications' security posture.

The Vantage Platform
The Vantage Platform leverages the power of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to orchestrate three purpose-built application security solutions that give enterprises an unprecedented ability to inspect, prevent and detect exploitable vulnerabilities at each stage of the SDLC.

Vantage Inspect powered by ShiftLeft blends SCA, SAST and Infrastructure-as-Code technologies to comprehensively inspect an application's source code, Open Source libraries and infrastructure. Vantage Inspect plugs directly into the code repository, enabling developers to secure code earlier in development and ensure critical vulnerabilities are not deployed into pre-production.
Vantage Prevent introduces a patented, revolutionary Directed DAST technology that unlocks the ability for Developers and DevOps teams to integrate functional and dynamic security testing at each step of the development cycle and prevent exploitable vulnerabilities from reaching production.
Vantage Detect evolves traditional DAST technology to account for how modern applications are built and interacts with APIs to give security teams a last line of defense against breaches. Vantage Detect continuously simulates a variety of attacks from the perspective of a hacker to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities quickly and accurately in pre-and post-production environments.

The Vantage Platform is Designed to be SAFE
Streamlined. Accurate. Fast. Everywhere.
Streamlined
» Easily perform accurate security testing, no matter where you operate within the SDLC » Open API allows teams to build custom integrations with developers, DevOps and
security teams' preferred tech stack. » Automated workflow integrations speed up remediation cycles and integrate security
results directly with common tracking systems
Accurate
» Limits the noise with low false-positives and proof-based evidence collection » Driven by data science with over 20 years of application security data » Broad coverage for OWASP and benchmark tested
Fast
» Run scans that can be measured in minutes-- not days » Reconnaissance quickly discovers attack surface utilizing crawling, probing and
functional tests as input » Speed-to-results for all use cases, providing timely information to remediate or mitigate
Everywhere
» Strategically layered application security testing at the most critical inflection points of the SDLC -- locally or in the cloud
» Secure code in any environment, whether locally, within build pipelines or fully deployed into production
» Cloud-based SaaS platforms integrates results from layered testing solutions delivering powerful insights accessible via the user interface or APIs
