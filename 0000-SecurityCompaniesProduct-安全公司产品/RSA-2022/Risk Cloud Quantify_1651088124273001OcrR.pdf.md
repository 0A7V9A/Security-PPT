Risk Cloud Quantify for Any Application
Every day your company faces wider levels of uncertainty and risk exposure. Risk Cloud QuantifyTM helps you make more strategic, defensible risk decisions that you can easily communicate across your enterprise. Within Risk Cloud, you can integrate quantitative analyses with the existing qualitative assessments. Risk Cloud Quantify can be used across business units, functions, and geographies in different use cases to better understand how to allocate investments, what risks to take on, and ROI.
Clarify Risks for Leadership
Executive teams and board rooms are more immersed in governance, risk, and compliance than ever before. Making risk-informed business decisions can give organizations the strategic advantage. Risk Cloud Quantify equips risk professionals with the confidence to communicate risk strategies by translating risks in terms of money. Conversations around risk can move faster, strategies are made more precise and confidence in business outcomes is increased.
Risk Cloud QuantifyTM is built on the Open FAIRTM (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) Model to rank risks within the Risk Cloud® platform. This international standard for risk management modeling allows for transparency into how you arrive at your numbers while factoring in confidence levels around the data you input. Over time, the data extracted in Risk Cloud Quantify will become more precise and robust.
