Conduct Comprehensive Inventory Management
With YubiEnterprise Delivery, organizations can easily consolidate inventory management which includes centrally managing all YubiKey inventory until shipment, and even consolidating inventory across multiple purchase orders.

Getting started with YubiEnterprise Delivery
It's easy to get started with the Delivery service. Once a purchase order is processed, an organization (org) is created in the YubiEnterprise console and the purchase order inventory is enabled for shipments. The customer is then directed to the YubiEnterprise Services console to register and request shipments to any number of destinations.
YubiEnterprise Subscription customers can easily track their subscription inventory directly in the console, conduct self-service and request shipments against their subscription entitlement. Actions such as requesting additional keys, adding buffer stock, requesting replacement stock and other actions are possible directly from the console.
Easily delegate administrators to place orders for various locations
Any individual who has administrative rights to the YubiEnterprise console can place orders for keys through the console. And admins can be delegated across locations so that they can best gauge the number of users who will need YubiKeys and request shipments all at once, or tiered over time as needed.

Customer admins can also delegate access to their team members to log into YubiEnterprise Services console and create shipment requests. For each shipment request, YubiEnterprise Delivery will automatically calculate the appropriate shipping fees / taxes and VAT based on the destination address and this information is provided in the console. At the end of the month, the customer will receive an invoice from Yubico for the shipping fees and taxes/VAT.
Enter and track shipments easily with a Cloud-based
Administrative Console
Users can sign into the YubiEnterprise Console and go to Shipment Requests. Each shipment request can be individually tracked. You can also download a list of all shipment requests and associated details.
YubiEnterprise Delivery enables customers to request shipments for up to a year after the initial purchase order and will hold the customer's inventory, which includes both regular or custom keys. After the twelve month period is over, YubiEnterprise Delivery will ship the remainder of the keys to the original customer address on file. The customer will also be notified 60 and 30 days prior to the period expiry via email on their upcoming expiry.
