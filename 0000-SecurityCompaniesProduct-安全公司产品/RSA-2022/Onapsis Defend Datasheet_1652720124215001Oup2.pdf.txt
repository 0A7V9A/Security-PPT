Continuous Threat Detection and Response for Mission-Critical Applications

Threat Detection And Response Onapsis Defend enables real-time threat alerts so organizations can respond quickly to unauthorized changes, misuse, or cyberattacks targeting mission-critical applications hosted in cloud, hybrid and on-premises environments.
Defend helps organizations enable more effective threat monitoring and gives security teams unprecedented visibility into critical applications.

Onapsis Defend continuously monitors mission-critical applications hosted in cloud, hybrid and on-premises environments for internal and external threats, including changes, critical transactions and user activity that introduce risk, exploit a vulnerability or take the organization out of compliance. Intelligent, research-driven capabilities reduce and prioritize incidents so organizations can focus on actionable, probable events.
Real-time notifications and integrations with SIEMs allow Security Operations Center (SOC) and Incident Response Teams to respond quickly to active threats, determine root cause analysis and use Defend as a compensating control until the issue can be resolved.
