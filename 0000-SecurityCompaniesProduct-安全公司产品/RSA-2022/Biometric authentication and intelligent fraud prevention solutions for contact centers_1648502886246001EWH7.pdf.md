Nuance Gatekeeper Authentication and Fraud Prevention Solutions

Biometric authentication and intelligent fraud prevention solutions for contact centers
Improve customer experiences, empower agents, and prevent fraud

Customers expect fast, easy, personal experiences when they call your IVR and contact center. But verifying them with passwords or personal information is slow, impersonal, and easy to exploit. Device-centric authentication is unreliable, inflexible, and can be spoofed. Both approaches create bad customer experiences, reduce agent productivity, and enable fraud.

Nuance layers advanced voice biometrics with other factors to verify the actual person on the other end of the phone. Our AI risk engine authenticates legitimate customers in seconds and detects fraudsters before they reach the IVR or an agent--reducing friction for legitimate customers, freeing agents to focus on delivering great service, and empowering fraud teams to prevent more fraud.
