JAMF THREAT DEFENSE
Protect your devices, users and applications from cyber threats
Jamf Threat Defense provides cloud-delivered security that operates on the device and in the network
Powerful endpoint security
Threat Defense detects and remediates the broadest range of endpoint threats including device vulnerabilities, malware and risky apps. Comprehensive risk assessments are continuously performed to identify threats, enabling security policies to be enforced in real-time.
Network defenses protect users and data
Stop attacks before they begin with in-network defenses. Content protection blocks malicious sites, including never-before-seen zero-day phishing sites designed to capture business credentials. Additionally, Threat Defense prevents command-and-control and data exfiltration by blocking connectivity with risky sites. Connections are secured automatically when person-in-themiddle attacks are detected.
Adaptive access to your applications
Elevate your security posture by allowing only secure and trusted devices to access business applications. Threat Defense continously monitors a broad set of telemetry and contextual inputs that can be used to prevent application access when an endpoint is compromised or at high risk. Adaptive access policies can be enforced natively through the Zero Trust Network Access solution or Jamf's management solution, Jamf Pro.

Comprehensive threat detection and prevention

Zero-day network protection
Threat Defense identifies and blocks even the most sophisticated attacks on the network, including zero-day phishing attempts, command and control communication, and cryptojacking. The service works with any app, including web browsers, email, social media and SMS.
Real-time risk assessments
Threat Defense continuously evaluates endpoint risk­from vulnerable OS to malicious profiles­enabling organizations to quickly identify devices that are out of compliance, and to enforce true zero trust access policies.

Detailed app insights
Threat Defense provides advanced app intelligence that can be used for both app vetting workflows and security investigations. A risk score is provided for each app, along with a detailed report listing the permissions and embedded URLs that put both user and organizational data at risk.
Dynamic data encryption
Threat Defense prevents compromised Wi-Fi infrastructure from exposing sensitive data by using real-time encryption. The service operates quietly in the background and no user interaction is required.

Leading security features and capabilities

Always-on endpoint defense
Threat Defense protects mobile workers and devices by using an endpoint app to identify malicious software, vulnerable configurations and risky connections before a breach can occur.

Conditional Access policies
Prevent business applications from being accessed when risk thresholds exceed predefined values. Conditional Access policies can be enforced natively within the Threat Defense network or via integration with Jamf or an Identity Provider.

Real-time reporting and policy controls
The unified policy engine allows administrators to quickly configure a security policy; enforcement occurs immediately allowing policies to be tuned and tailored on the fly. Detailed reports can be viewed inside the Threat Defense portal or exported to third-party tools via easy-touse integrations.

Unified operations and management
Threat Defense integrates directly with management infrastructure enabling the service to be deployed quickly to managed devices. The integration also simplifies event monitoring and threat hunting for ThreatOps by adding human readable names to reporting.

Jamf Threat Defense works seamlessly with your existing IT services and technologies.
Deep integrations with Microsoft, Google, Cisco and more help you extend the value of your existing tech stack.
