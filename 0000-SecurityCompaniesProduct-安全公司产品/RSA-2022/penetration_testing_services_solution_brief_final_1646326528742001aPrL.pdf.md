PREVENT DATA LOSS, COMPROMISE AND BREACHES Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is one of the best ways to assess the real-world effectiveness of your technical controls, policies and procedures. In many cases, it is also a mandatory requirement to meet compliance regulations or industry standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and others.

FIND SECURITY ISSUES BEFORE ATTACKERS DO
Not all penetration tests are created equal. Many firms that claim to offer pen testing rely on a single automated tool with little penetration testing experience or knowledge beyond what the tool can do for them (and just as importantly, what it does not do).
Motorola Solutions employs a multifaceted approach ­ one that integrates research along with in-depth technical analysis and "manual" testing. Our approach looks at publicly leaked or available information, missing controls, system misconfigurations and system vulnerabilities just like a malicious hacker would.

EXPERT ASSISTANCE UNCOVERS SECURITY RISKS
When conducting a pen test, our information security experts simulate the thought processes and actions of a malicious external or internal actor to get unauthorized access to systems or to extract sensitive information.
Using a flexible methodology, which includes internal, external, physical and other pen testing procedures, we employ every resource at our disposal to reveal issues that could leave your organization at risk ­ before a malicious hacker exploits them.

KEY FEATURES

To keep pace with the ever-growing cyber threat, Motorola Solutions offers a suite of penetration testing assessments. Once completed, our reports are very comprehensive, giving you a clear understanding of the testing methodology; the extent of the work performed; extensive documentation of findings; and prioritized remediation advice.

IDENTIFY RISKS TO YOUR INTERNAL IT INFRASTRUCTURE While most organizations initially think of defending their sensitive data and systems from external attacks, many successful attacks against an organization come from within the network boundary, making internal penetration testing all the more critical to find vulnerabilities in networks, systems, servers and applications.

ADDRESS DATA PROTECTION AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS External penetration testing assesses risks outside your infrastructure, including firewalls, web servers, email systems, external routers and remote access. They are designed to replicate the tools and techniques that malicious hackers would use to compromise your organization.

FIND UNPROTECTED OR UNAUTHORIZED WIRELESS NETWORKS AND DEVICES We determine the level of security of your organization's wireless environment by having skilled penetration testers perform a rogue device detection sweep and attempt to compromise your wireless infrastructure. This approach provides very quantifiable results and can identify weaknesses in any of these areas.

UNCOVER POTENTIAL THREATS TO YOUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT Our multifaceted approach to testing your organization's security posture can also include social engineering and physical security testing to create a simulation of complex, real-world "blended" threats that could put your offices or employees at risk for a breach or compromise.
