Detecting Unknown and Insider Threats
As cyberattacks become more complex, these threats are harder to detect. Traditional rule-based approaches are ineffective against advanced threats because rule-based solutions generate thousands of false alerts.
Securonix UEBA tracks anomalous user behavior, suspicious lateral movements, and insider threats within your organization ­ whether in the cloud, or on-premises. Your team will gain cloud monitoring with builtin APIs for all major cloud infrastructures as well as many security and business applications. Additionally, our UEBA solution reduces noise by leveraging machine learning capabilities and out-of-the-box use case content so your team can focus on the highest-risk alerts.

Stay Ahead of Insider and Advanced Threats
Insider threats are always a risk, whether malicious or negligent. Traditional security solutions aren't able to identify behavior changes, making it harder to detect advanced and insider threats. They react after the damage is done or are blind to the fact that an attack even took place.
Securonix UEBA helps you mitigate the risk of insider threats. Our UEBA solution takes a more proactive approach by monitoring user and entity behaviors. It applies machine learning and analytics to assign risk scores against users' behavioral patterns. High risks users are flagged for the security team, so analysts can add them to a watch list or investigate their behavior further. Securonix UEBA alerts you of behaviors such as data exfiltration, privilege account abuse and misuse, compromised users, and botnet infections.
Reduce False Positives and Noise With Behavioral Analytics
Many SIEM solutions generate a sea of false positive alarms that make it difficult to identify the actual threats in time to stop the damage. With Securonix UEBA, you find complex threats with minimal noise. Our solution helps correlate and identify threats that span across multiple events.
Detect Threats Faster
A single security alert without context or connection to related events isn't an efficient method to detect threats. Gain more efficiency and uncover threats faster using Securonix's threat chain models. Our threat chain models stitch together a series of events that are related. Instead of chasing multiple separate alarms, analysts receive one alarm with all the related events. Your teams can more rapidly identify complex threats using Securonix.

Use Advanced Analytics to Detect Sophisticated and Insider Threats
Understanding normal behavior versus abnormal behavior is critical to detecting insider threats. Securonix UEBA uses threat chains and advanced machine learning behavioral analytics to identify complex and insider threats.
