There is an open doorway
in your cyber defense strategy.
In a world where cybersecurity has become a critical business priority, and organizations in every industry across the globe have directed significant investment to the people, policies and technology infrastructure charged to protect and defend against a broad spectrum of threat vectors, it is beyond belief that one of the main doorways between business and the public has been left open and unguarded...

THE PROBLEM

The Doorway is open.
The Doorway is your Voice Network.
But here's the rub; it's not about the technical infrastructure itself, there are effective solutions to protect the hardware and software. The issue at hand is the calls, or traffic that is going across the Voice Network (both in and out).

Within the traffic that the goes in and out of your organization 24 x 7 x 365 are a host of threats. Initial access brokers, hackers, bad actors and cyber thieves and terrorists are actively infiltrating your voice network with no fear of being stopped, because the huge majority of cybersecurity measures, in relation to your telephony infrastructure, are protecting that infrastructure (hardware and software) from being compromised, technically.
The calls, or traffic, going in and out of your voice network are almost completely unchecked!
The majority of enterprise voice traffic is valid, business enabling, transactional calls. Typically this traffic totals 82% - 90% of your overall traffic (depending on industry).
But, what about the remaining 10% - 18%?
Well, this is where the risk lies. In this Unwanted Traffic lies a wide and growing range of threats, including:

Direct Nefarious Calls Social Engineering Vishing Smishing

Robocalls Spoof Calls Spam Calls

These malicious tactics are employed to gain information, data and IP which is assembled and sold over the dark web to orchestrate an evolving list of business-impacting events, including:
TDoS Attacks Ransomware Attacks Data Breach Data/IP Theft Identity Theft
But let's be clear, the bad actors who are calling into your organization have three key directives:
1. Get a human to answer the phone 2. Get a human to engage 3. Acquire information from that human

The calls, or traffic, going in and out of your voice network are almost completely unchecked!
