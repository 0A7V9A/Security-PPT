" Development and security teams can be aligned regarding cybersecurity!

We built our own tool to orchestrate security tools, evaluate risks, escalate priorities and manage our CI/CD pipeline. Probely was the missing piece, enabling us to seamlessly integrate with their service through their full-featured API. We also ended up doing less analysis work since Probely only reports real vulnerabilities.

And thanks for the amazing

customer support. Good job

guys!

"Cyber attacks are becoming more and more frequent and complex, which is why cybersecurity has been a growing business concern.
Probely helps us secure our web applications without compromising our project deadlines. We are able to start testing security in early stages of development, avoiding problems later, when the cost to
x is higher.
Our developers love Probely because of the easy instructions on how to x the vulnerabilities and because it only reports what
" matters, false-positive free.
