File Server Auditor We believe all organizations should instantly be able to see 'who, what, where and when' files and folders are created, accessed, modified, copied or deleted at the click of a button. We also think it's essential that organizations are easily able to track and compare permissions across their data. Lepide's File Server auditing solution addresses the challenges of the rise of the insider-threat and the reporting requirements associated with common regulatory compliance mandates. We give IT teams the power to see more, faster. Track access attempts and changes to your files and folders with granular who, what, when and where information. Understand when your users are copying your files to help maintain security and integrity of data. Real time alerts, threshold alerts and pre-defined reports for all security and compliance needs.

Session Monitoring
Invisible User Monitoring. The solution will not be visible to the user during the monitoring process, so you can be confident that your employees will be entirely unaware of its installation or execution. Lepide will automatically start monitoring activities the moment systems are started and will continue to monitor even if a user restarts the system. Session recording can also take place offline, allowing you to access recordings at your convenience. Through the solution, you can re-start, turn off or completely shut down a computer on which you have seen unauthorized or unwanted activity taking place. Warning messages can be sent to the user in question before any further action is taken. You also have the option to periodically display custom pop-up message on all monitored computers. Delegate Viewing Rights to Specific Users. The viewing aspect of the monitoring feature can be installed on any system you wish. The administrator can delegate monitoring rights for all computers or specific computers only to any specified user. You can also search for and download any video recordings for future reference.

Track Changes Made to Sensitive Data: If you are providing access to your companies most sensitive data through Google Drive, then it's important to understand who interacting with that data. Through creations, deletions, modifications and altering access via permission changes, we help by giving you better insight across your shared data.
Track Administrative Changes in G Suite: Just as its important to understand how your business users are interacting with the data and the surrounding applications with G Suite, you should easily be able to identify how and when users are being given access. Administrators or privileged users hold all the keys to the applications, Lepide can help you keep account of all administrative activities from privilege escalation to system configuration change ensuring the applications and data are available only to the people who actually need access.
