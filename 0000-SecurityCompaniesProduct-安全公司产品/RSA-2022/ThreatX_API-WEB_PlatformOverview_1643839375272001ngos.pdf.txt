Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) that Just Works
PROTECT YOUR APPS
Anywhere. Effortlessly.

It Just Keeps Getting Tougher Every Day

More apps. Changing architectures. More sophisticated threats. Who has the time--or the staff--to keep up with it all?
Modern organizations need to support both on-prem and hybrid cloud environments. APIs and microservices architectures must be securely protected to prevent abuse and thwart debilitating attacks. At the same time, revenue-generating access to those same services must be allowed to flow freely. And, to make matters worse, a wide array of highly sophisticated and high-impact threats like injection attacks, denial of service, account takeover, brute force, credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and web scanning are persistently targeting the perimeter.

The result? An untenable burden on security staff who are required to constantly tune rules, analyze false positives and false negatives, and investigate inconclusive anomalies.
Add to all of that the need to work in lockstep with DevOps teams, and you've got a perfect storm of security challenges brewing.
It's complicated. And legacy WAFs are falling short in delivering solutions that help. ThreatX's cloud-native Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) takes a fresh approach that eliminates many of the headaches currently associated with legacy WAFs.

Gartner observed a 15% growth in WAAP inquiries in 2020 compared with the previous year...attributed to the expansion of organizations' digital transformation initiatives adding more applications and APIs to their portfolios.*
