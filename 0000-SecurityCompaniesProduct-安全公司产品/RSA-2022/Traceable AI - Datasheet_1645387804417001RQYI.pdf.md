API Security for Cloud-Native Apps
Traceable enables security and engineering to keep up with the continuous pace of change and complexity, and to protect applications from traditional & advanced application and API threats
Traceable AI applies the power of distributed tracing and unsupervised machine learning to enable you to:

Know where you are exposed
 API Discovery - auto inventory of all your APIs  API DNA - auto generated detailed API specs  API Insights - runtime API and user behavior  API Risk Monitoring - continuous scoring  User Attributed Activity Tracking

Detect & Stop API and Web Attacks
 API & Web Application Protection  Sensitive Data Tracking  ATO and Brute-force Attack Protection  API Vulnerability Detection  Multi-session Threat Detection  OPA policy enforcement / blocking  Drop-in Security Enhancement  Satisfies PCI-DSS 6.6 WAF requirement

Use Insights to Improve
 Trace Explorer - searchable transaction data lake  Threat Hunting - explore for signs of threats  Forensics - review full requests and responses  Audit and Compliance - track API and data changes  API Performance Metrics - errors, latency, calls, etc
