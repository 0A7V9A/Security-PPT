Default Deny

Default Deny is a solution that enables only allowed applications to run on your machine. When the agent is first installed it catalogs all of the files and applications that exist on the machine and creates policies automatically based around this. This is known as ThreatLockers learning mode. From here each application is assessed against the list of policies to see if they match. If they do not match, they will hit ThreatLockers default deny policy and will not be able to run on your machine.

Default Deny has long been considered the gold standard in protecting businesses from known and unknown executables.

Ringfencing
Controlling what software can run should be the first line of defense when it comes to better protecting yourself against malicious software. Ringfencing adds a second line of defense for applications that are permitted. First, by defining how applications can interact with each other, secondly, by controlling what resources applications can access, such as network, files, and registry. Ringfencing is an invaluable tool in the fight against fileless malware and software exploits.
When you first deploy Ringfencing, your machine will automatically be aligned with the default ThreatLocker policies. These policies are then automatically applied to a list of default applications such as Microsoft Office, Powershell and virtual meeting applications. The aim of the default policies is to provide a baseline level of protection for all networks. Each of these policies can easily be manipulated to fit any environment at any time. ThreatLockers team of dedicated Cyber Heroes are always on hand to support any requests, 24/7/365.

Elevation Control
When it comes to adding extra layers of security to your cyber security stack, it is important to always add a human layer. Users with admin access are often the weakest link across your network, so it is vital that their movements are monitored and tracked. ThreatLockers Elevation Control provides an additional layer of security by giving IT administrators the power to remove local admin privileges from their users, whilst allowing them to run individual applications as an administrator.
Elevation Control is easy to use, easy to implement, and will save you time and resources in the long run. Once you have implemented the ThreatLocker solution, the IT administrator can go through and choose specific applications for users to run as an administrator. Once this process has been set up the IT administrator can always edit the Elevation Control policy where needed.

Complete Visibility of Administrative Rights:
Gives you the ability to approve or deny an individual's access to specific applications within an organization even if the user is not a local administrator.

Varied Levels of Elevation:
Enables you to set durations for how long users are allowed access to specific applications by granting either temporary or permanent access.

Streamlined Permission Requests:
Users can request permission to elevate applications and attach files and notes to support their requests.

Secure Application Integration
In combination with ThreatLocker RingfencingTM, ensures that once applications are elevated, users cannot jump to infiltrate connected applications within the network.

Storage Control:
Most data protection programs on the market are butcher knife solutions to a problem that requires a scalpel. Blocking USB drives and encrypting data-storage servers can help secure your organization's private data, but these tools don't take into account that this data still needs to be utilized and quickly. Waiting for approval or trying to find a device that's allowed to access needed files can drain hours of productivity.
ThreatLocker® Storage Control is an advanced storage control solution that protects information. We give you the tools to control the flow and access of your data. This can be done in a variety of ways. You can control what USBs are permitted to be used across your entire network, and you can choose what file and folder locations applications are allowed to access.
By using ThreatLocker®, you are in control of your file servers, USB drives, and your data which in turn will help you stay better protected against cyber threats.

Comprehensive Auditing:
A full audit of all file access on USB, Network and Local Hard Drives.

Application file/folder Controls:
Limit access to a device or file share based on the application.

Granular access:
Restrict or deny access to external storage, including USB drives, network shares, or other devices.

Total USB Control:
Enforce or audit the encryption status of USB hard drives and other external storage.

Easy Approvals:
Single-click approval for specified devices or users for a limited amount of time or permanently.
