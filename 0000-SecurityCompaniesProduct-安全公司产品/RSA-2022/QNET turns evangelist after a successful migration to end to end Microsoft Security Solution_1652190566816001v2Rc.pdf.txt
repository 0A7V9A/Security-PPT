"After 20 years with QNET, I reserved judgement as CIO until I could see the value of the Microsoft Security solution. Now, I'm a believer."
Ivan Woo, Chief Information Officer, QNET

Situation:
Global e-commerce company QNET faced regular security threats to its IT infrastructure, but staff had little visibility into a complex on-premises environment, and it struggled to identify the safest way to make changes.

Solution:
The company transformed its IT services, adopting key Microsoft Security products, including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Microsoft Sentinel.

Impact:
QNET's IT staff gained extensive end-toend visibility into its new cloud infrastructure, providing the company with a more proactive security environment that boosts staff productivity without increase in cost, while accelerating the organization's path toward Zero Trust.
