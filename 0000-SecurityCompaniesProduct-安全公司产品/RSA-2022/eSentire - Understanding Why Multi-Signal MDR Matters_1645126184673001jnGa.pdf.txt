Understanding Why Multi-Signal MDR Matters
Cloud adoption, business applications and remote users continue to expand at exponential rates. Your cybersecurity team is fighting a losing battle to keep pace with your business requirements and growing attack surface. While traditional security controls and MSSPs were once effective, they are no match for the growing speed and sophistication of modern threats.

Officially recognized by Gartner in 2016, Managed Detection and Response has exploded in popularity answering the challenge to rapidly identify advanced threats and contain them before business disrupting damage can occur. Unfortunately, the number of vendors and the variety of coverage has resulted in industry-wide confusion. While most MDR vendors claim to deliver complete protection, the fact is many provide limited signal visibility and response, leaving you unprotected against critical parts of the attack surface.
For example, one of the most popular subcategories of MDR, Managed Endpoint Detection and Response, provides coverage at the host level (endpoint) while leaving the perimeter, user, application and data layer without critical visibility and response capabilities. The significance of endpoint protection is undisputed, but keep in mind it is only one layer of a complete defense in depth approach.
On the other hand, MDR providers reliant upon logs through the usage of SIEMs may have greater visibility across the attack surface but lack the ability to contain and respond across different signal sources. Managed Detection and Response services are successful when containment can be initiated. The right mix of operational technologies and personnel must be in place for that to be effective so we can stop attackers before they accomplish their objectives.

It's important to remember that MDR providers can only detect and respond to what they can see. For uncovered layers of the attack surface, security teams must have the people, process and technology to monitor, detect and respond to advanced and evasive threats. The critical decisions you must address are:
· What is the scope of our attack surface now and in the future? · What level of coverage do we require across each layer of the attack surface? · Do we have the resources to monitor, detect and contain attackers for areas that would be otherwise
uncovered by an MDR provider?
At eSentire, we believe a multi-signal approach is paramount to protecting your complete attack surface. Whether your environment is in the cloud, on-premises or somewhere in between we have the visibility to see what other MDR providers will miss. Leveraging a proprietary cloud-based XDR platform and expert human threat hunters, our Managed Detection and Response services identify and stop attackers ANYWHERE your environment or users reside.

Our multi-signal approach ingests endpoint, network, log, cloud, asset and vulnerability data that enables complete attack surface visibility. Enriched detections from the eSentire Threat Response Unit are applied to captured data identifying known threats and suspicious activity across every layer of the attack surface.
Automated blocking capabilities built into our eSentire Atlas XDR Cloud Platform prevent attackers from gaining an initial foothold while our expert Elite Threat Hunters can initiate manual containment at multiple levels of the attack surface. Through the use of host isolation, malicious network communication disruption, identity-based restriction and other measures, we can stop the attacker at any level.
