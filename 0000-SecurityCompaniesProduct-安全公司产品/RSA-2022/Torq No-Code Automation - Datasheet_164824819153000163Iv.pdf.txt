Easy Automation for Better Security
1. Reduce alert fatigue. Focus on what matters by automatically handling duplicate alerts and false positives.
2. Remediate and respond faster. Automate remediation and threat response flows to improve security posture.
3. Integrate security into any process. Schedule workflow runs, trigger automatically, or run manually via Slack, CLI and more.
No integrations. No plugins. No waiting.
 Torq connects to anything, anywhere. On premise,
public cloud, private cloud, you name it. Hundreds of out of the box templates cover most common security tools and platforms.
 Something not already covered? Torq's simple
integration tools let you easily connect to it - no matter what it is or where it runs. No integrations, no plugins, no need for professional services.
