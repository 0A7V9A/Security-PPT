DATASHEET

BrightCloud® Streaming Malware Detection
Catch malicious files in transit before they infiltrate your customers' networks
Overview
· The vast majority of malware is polymorphic and designed to evade detection
· Traditional and network-based security approaches are too slow and ineffective
· Analyzing files as they enter the network catches malware before it can spread
Polymorphic malware hides from traditional detection technologies by changing its code each time it runs. These variants tend to be extremely short-lived. Organizations that rely on traditional security are unlikely to catch them before they infiltrate and spread across networks and systems.
BrightCloud® Streaming Malware Detection combats the challenges of polymorphic malware. This innovative technology provides a determination for files as they stream through the network perimeter, often without requiring the entire file to be downloaded. The contents of a file are parsed as the file streams through a network appliance and scored at a rate of over 5,000 per minute to avoid posing any undue network latency. Users set policies for the threshold at which files are allowed, blocked/ dropped or routed for further investigation and analysis.
This solution can be used as an additional layer of security in front of other slower, heuristic or signature-based technologies such as sandboxes or antivirus. This frees up network bandwidth by dropping malware at the perimeter and eliminates the need to re-inspect benign files. It is also ideal for integration with backup solutions and storage management devices to ensure clean backup copies. It can be used for upfront network filtering by internet service providers or content delivery networks to filter out malicious files before they reach customers.

86% of malware is unique to a single PC.1

Partner Benefits
1. Block/address the malware at the network edge preventing the lateral spread
2. Faster (policy-based) response to potential malware without network bandwidth or user experience impact
3. Enhanced protection with AI-based intelligence combining historical insights and real-time insights
Additional Enhancements with File Reputation
Streaming Malware Detection can be coupled with BrightCloud® File Reputation to provide an even stronger layer of defense. Combining file intelligence with cutting-edge polymorphic detection ensures superior coverage of both known and never-before-seen files.
The BrightCloud® File Reputation service provides up-to-the minute file intelligence derived from millions of real-world sensors. Each file is analyzed by the latest machine learning techniques and vetted through years of threat expertise. This real-time lookup service of known malicious and allowed file identifiers helps to effectively stop the distribution of threats through networks. This verification significantly reduces the amount of `noise' by enabling policies to automatically determine which files to allow, block or investigate further, allowing security administrators to focus on unknown potential threats.

Easy Integration
The BrightCloud® Streaming Malware Detection SDK integrates seamlessly into perimeter security devices used by enterprises, small to mid-sized businesses or consumers, including next-generation firewalls, firewall routers, network intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, email and web gateways, unified threat and management devices.
