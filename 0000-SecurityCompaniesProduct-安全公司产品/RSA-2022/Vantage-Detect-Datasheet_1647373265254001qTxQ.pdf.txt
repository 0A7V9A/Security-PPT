VANTAGE DETECT | DATASHEET

Organizations need an application security solution that is flexible, easy to use, and can handle modern applications the way they are built.
Modern application security requires a modern solution that can keep up with an organization's unique processes and tools. Attempting to maintain critical delivery times while adopting new, one-size-fits-all point products does nothing but slow processes down. Organizations need a platform that empowers security across the "build, deploy, and run" phases of their CI/DC pipeline, as well as provide a modern, cloud-based, SaaS-based solution that keeps up with their modern application delivery requirements and delivering results in their existing workflow management or reporting systems.
Vantage Detect delivers modern DAST at the speed of modern development
Vantage Detect evolves traditional DAST technology to account for how modern applications are built. Vantage Detect continuously simulates a variety of attacks from the perspective of a hacker to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities quickly and accurately in publicly accessible applications. Vantage Detect is a cloud based, SaaS solution that provides a holistic view into how scans are organized and matched to the organizations structure of their application security program. Organizations have the ability to easily transfer scan licenses between applications based on the needs of the organization. With Vantage Detect, SecOps and DevOps teams can plan and execute application vulnerability scans, easily transfer licenses between applications based on unique environments/ processes, and tools of the organizations ­ all delivered in a single pane of glass solution.

How Does Vantage Detect Work?

STEP 1
Customer configures their application scope and scan schedule

STEP 2
Scan evaluates websites/targets for vulnerabilities

STEP 3
Customer reviews scan findings and assigns for remediation

STEP 4
Developer applies fix or mitigation to address the vulnerability

STEP 5
Re-scan and automatically close the finding if no evidence of the vulnerability is found

Features
AppSec teams are expected to be focused on prioritizing and facilitating the resolution of vulnerabilities. Instead, most security teams are overwhelmed and/or are struggling with the configuration and management of their AppSec scans. Vantage Detect utilizes the 20+ years of industry expertise in application security to filter out the noise and only surface actionable vulnerabilities. Vantage Detect brings speed, flexibility, and simplicity to Enterprise AppSec and addresses the most impactful and prevalent vulnerabilities found in modern applications. Some of its key features are:
Reusable Scan Schedules
Free up your AppSec team to focus on higher value tasks rather than spending hours managing scan schedules.  Create a scan schedule to define when you want your AppSec scans to run and associate it with
multiple applications via Scan Profiles
 Schedule modifications can be made in a single location and automatically inherited by your
applications Managing AppSec security scan schedules for each of your organization's applications creates an administrative headache whenever the schedule needs to be updated. Reusable scan schedules allow your AppSec team to configure a schedule once and associate it with multiple applications.
Parallel Scanning with Findings as they are discovered
Reduce the time it takes to scan applications and get actionable results fast.  Multiple Web Targets used as entry point for a scan to multi-thread your AppSec scans  Enables AppSec teams to organize their scans according to who will address the findings  Scans run concurrently and generate findings (vulnerabilities) as they are discovered
Traditional DAST scans can take days (or weeks) to complete because of the linear nature of the scans. Scanners usually crawl applications to discover (attack vectors) the targets that need to be attacked. Vantage Detect gives you the flexibility to structure your scans, enabling you to begin the crawl at multiple entry points of your application, in parallel.

Single-Page Application (SPA) Support
Get an accurate picture of application risk for modern single-page applications.
Modern applications that use a Single-Page architecture are notoriously difficult to scan. Furthermore, they are prone to generate incomplete results when scanned using traditional DAST tools. Vantage Detect has been designed with SPA's in mind to get effective coverage for all modern applications.
Vantage Detect REST API
Enabling you to automate workflows and retrieve scan results for consolidated reporting.  Robust and fully documented REST API for custom integrations  Swagger UI documentation to view/test endpoints  Utilize the same REST API used for the Vantage Detect UI
Security tools with incomplete or poorly designed API's make it difficult or impossible to integrate with an organization's internal systems. Vantage Detect uses an API-first methodology to ensure users can programmatically manage their applications, scans, and get access to vulnerability information.
Credential Management for Authenticated Scans
Simplify the management of site credentials and reduce the error prone nature of credential management.  Use Selenium scripts to capture site credentials  Upload Selenium script(s) for your applications and associate with the applicable portion(s) of
your sites via Scan Profiles
 Updates to credentials are automatically applied to all associated Scan Profiles whenever new
scripts are uploaded Managing credentials is notoriously difficult as they are changed frequently and are typically owned by individuals outside the AppSec team. Credentials in Vantage Detect are reusable objects so they can be associated with multiple sections of your application, simplifying the management when they need to be updated.
