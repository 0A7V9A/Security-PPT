THE STAKES ARE HIGH Cyber attacks are increasing in number and sophistication costing organizations millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. Not all attacks can be stopped but are you doing everything you can to protect your technology ecosystem? Are you compliant with industry-recognized standards and frameworks for cybersecurity? Do you know where your network and applications are most vulnerable?

ROADMAP TO BETTER CYBERSECURITY
Taking a holistic approach to assessing your organization's cyber resilience is critical to protect your entire technology ecosystem from cybercrime. It requires you to develop a complete understanding of your system vulnerabilities, ensure adherence with regulatory and compliance frameworks, prepare an effective response should an attack happen and develop roadmaps to protect your network, devices and applications.

PARTNER WITH SECURITY ADVISORS
Most organizations do not have personnel with a deep knowledge of the latest cybersecurity standards, frameworks, policies and procedures, leaving vulnerabilities open to cybercriminals. Hiring security advisors to assess your system and provide a roadmap can bring your organization the critical information needed to make informed decisions on the best and latest security procedures and controls that should be implemented in line with your business objectives.

BY 2021 IT IS ESTIMATED THAT GLOBALLY CYBERCRIME WILL COST SIX TRILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY1.

SOLUTION BRIEF RISK ASSESSMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES

KEY FEATURES
COMPLETE RISK ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Our Risk Assessment and Consulting Service provides a structured approach for identifying, assessing and managing cyber risks. Our services are designed to deliver on industry standards and frameworks including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), ISO 27001/2, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Payment Card Industry (PCI), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOA) and more.
We start by developing a thorough understanding of your requirements and the current environment. Then we use a proven methodology to identify and define specific risk elements unique to your environment and against industry standards and frameworks. We deliver a readiness dashboard that addresses vulnerabilities, business process and skills alignment based on your technology attributes, security architecture and governance policies.
After our initial assessment, you will be able to fully understand your cybersecurity risk posture related to your organization's operational environment and implement changes needed to minimize exposure. Not only do we provide a gap analysis and detailed remediation recommendations, but we also provide on-going assessments to continually monitor and make recommendations as new threats and governance policies emerge.
IMPLEMENT CYBER ACTIONS TO DRIVE RESULTS Our risk assessment professionals use a consultative approach to provide security resilience and regulatory assessments. We work with your team to define the scope of the engagement to meet your desired business outcomes. Our program follows a proven three-step approach which helps you to improve system resilience and availability.
· PRE-ASSESSMENT Together we define the scope and agree on the desired outcome to meet your operational needs. The engagement definition takes place with your team and our cybersecurity experts defining the statement of work and all deliverables. We develop an end-to-end understanding of your business operations including network architectures, security policies and controls, compliance and governance frameworks to finalize engagement scope and timelines.
· ONSITE-ASSESSMENT Our onsite assessment, which includes data gathering and documentation, starts with one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders, understanding business profiles and analyzing annual statements and existing approaches to security. Workshops are conducted to close out any knowledge gaps. We can perform regulatory assessments along with vulnerability and threat intelligence assessments to evaluate network, applications and endpoints.
· POST-ASSESSMENT Once our consultants have collected the data they will distill it down using a set of sophisticated programs including a Risk Scorecard report indicating low, moderate, high and critical severities for each finding. Then, working with your team, we will produce a set of roadmaps and recommendations to strengthen your system's cyber resilience.

REMEDIATION SERVICES - PUTTING KEY LEARNINGS TO WORK
The end goal of an assessment is to implement actions that drive desired results. Based upon the gaps identified we can introduce new technologies, governance models and provide services that help you withstand security threats on an on-going basis.

"When it comes to network security, we should also be using policy to drive how we prepare for cyber attacks on a day-to-day basis."
