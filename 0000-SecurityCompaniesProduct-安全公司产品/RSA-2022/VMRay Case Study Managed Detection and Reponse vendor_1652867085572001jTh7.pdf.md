A Leading Global Tech Company
How VMRay enables
STRATEGIC SECURITY AUTOMATION
CASE STUDY ≠ TECHNOLOGY
Manual analysis of a huge number of submissions was time-consuming. With VMRay, we are able to handle this task with ease in an automated way. This creates enormous value for our company, customers and partners. Cybersecurity Team Lead
Our customer, one of the one of the world's leading technology companies, benefits from VMRay's best-of-breed detection and automation capabilities to grow their global ecosystem of partners and customers even further.
THE CHALLENGE:
Manual process troubled with uncertainty
The customer's products and solutions serve as a platform for developers to introduce their applications to end users. To earn an approval batch, these third-party applications need to go through a notarization procedure. This brings reputation and reliability to the developers, and confidence and peace-of-mind to the end users. However, this very well-designed notarization system had an important bottleneck: the approvals -or rejections- were decided through a manual process. The time-consuming manual analysis was making it nearly impossible for the analysts zo analyze each submission into the deepest detail. For this reason, the notarization system could not ensure that a submission is completely clear with ultimate level of confidence.

PROBLEM
Time consuming manual processes In-depth analysis of each submission is almost impossible

IMPACT
Threats were likely to be missed
End users may be infected from trusted source
Developer community waits too long

THE IMPACT:
An equation of three variables

OUR CUSTOMER
Risk of missing some of the threats Losing the trust of users

END USERS
Risk of being infected by an approved app from their "trusted" source

DEVELOPER COMMUNITY
Long waits for approval Days and hours count in the fastchanging world of digital innovations

THE SOLUTION
Automation to the rescue!
The bottom line: our customer needed to automate this process. But automation requires highest level of trust to the tool and the input. If you have doubts about either the quality of the analysis or the automation capabilities of the tool, then you can not rely on the automated process with 100% confidence. Which means, the automation wouldn't be practically an option. This is why the customer trusted VMRay: to detect the undetectable, and to empower automation with ultimate peace of mind. Our customer now benefits from adding VMRay's best-of-breed technologies to their existing security stack. Through bulk submission, many application submissions can be analyzed with the right tools at once, without a need for full manual interaction.
THE RESULT:
A win-win-win story

OUR CUSTOMER
Confident that risk is minimized Analysts are no longer overwhelmed by the manual processes

END USERS
Happy to trust to their reliable brand No dissapointment from an infectious app

DEVELOPER COMMUNITY
Shorter time to market Instant innovation without losing any opportunity
