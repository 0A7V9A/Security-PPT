We represent Korean security companies and maintain a close relationship with them. With over 250 member companies, KISIA is aimed at the growth of the infrastructure of the security industry in Korea. As a specialized and professional body in the private sector, we listen attentively to the voice of the industry and create the optimized ecosystem for the businesses. Besides, we provide the Korean information security industry with support for global market entry. Organizing overseas business meetings and exhibitions, we encourage domestic companies to gain better chances not only to discover foreign business partners, also develop international trade with many other countries. Furthermore, we make consistent contributions to improvement of national policy by communicating closely with the government and producing the research reports on the information security field in Korea. KISIA seeks to create a concerted approach among companies, governments and organizations across the world for the comprehensive development of the security communities.

ABOUT COMPANY
AI Spera, a frontrunner in cyber threat intelligence, was founded at the Hacking Response Research Center, Korea University. Our data-driven security solutions are principally based on anomaly-behavior detection combined with AI and machine learning technology. Dedicated to ensuring ongoing visibility, we effectively manage assets that are scattered across the attack surface in order to safeguard them from attackers. The more sophisticated methods of attackers become, the harder we strive to contain threats lurking in the cyberspace.

MAIN PRODUCTS
· RMR Our foremost flagship product RMR(Risk Management Report) is a SaaS-based enterprise Attack Surface Management solution powered by AI and machine learning. Securing clear visibility into enterprise IT assets on the attack surface, its simple integration gives you the most exhaustive data feeds that cover all the externally exposed digital assets and vulnerabilities within.
· Prime Use Cases 1. Detection of new vulnerabilities
004

2. C losure of dangerous ports left wide open 3. D iscovery of new corporate assets
· Integration with Criminal IP Paired with our advanced Criminal IP, a Cyber Threat Intelligence search engine, conduct a more deeply contextualized search of the assets already identified through RMR and receive enriched threat intelligence via API integration.
DIFFERENTIATION
1. S treamlined security control Automatically generated threat report alleviates the burden compounded by outdated security control infrastructure
2. C overage of threat data 4.2 billion IP addresses, domains, ports, and all types of internet-facing information are refreshed and streamed around the clock
3. E asy accessibility via web-interface Adoption requires only one primary domain address of assets in operation
REFERENCE CUSTOMERS and KEY PERFORMANCE
· Performance Milestones - Korean Natural Language Processing Analysis (Recorded Future, 2020-2021) - RMR selected as one of the products included in the "Security Solution Supply Pool"(Korea Internet &Security Agency, 2021) - AI Security Analysis System ­ Implementation of Criminal IP to monitor malicious IPs for a leading Korean information technology company (KT ds, 2020) - Fraud Prevention Algorithm/Consignment Research ­ Integration of Criminal IP with Korean cryptocurrency exchange giant Upbit (Dunamu, 2019-2020) - Cyber Threat Intelligence Information ­ Implementation of Criminal IP to detect malicious users and bots for game operators (Netmarble, 2018-2020) - Provision of Criminal IP Academic License for incorporation into the university curricula (Korea University, 2020)

ABOUT COMPANY
Pseudo random number generators are vulnerable to hacking because they tend to have a predictable pattern hackers can exploit. The weak entropy problem is compounded for FinTech &IoT devices with limited access to physical random events such as mouse movement. EYL provides Quantum random number generator that extracts randomness from radioactive isotope put in the very tiny chip(2mm) in order to generate perfect encryption keys. EYL is the Diamond Winner of MassChallenge Boston last year among 2,600 startups from 80 countries.
MAIN PRODUCTS
· Quantum entropy chip - enables us to harvest ultimate randomness from nature using radioactive isotope decay - Can dramatically improve security of all IoT devices because they can provide more secure encryption powered by quantum entropy chip
· Quantum random number generator - USB, modular, PCI-Express type of quantum random number generators with varying speeds and user interface to meet the customer needs using Quantum entropy chip
006

· Quantum Shieldz® CipherTM - is a self-sufficient voice encryption device that works with your personal smartphone. - It uses an encryption key generated by a quantum random number generator (QRNG) to securely encrypt the user's voice, completely blocking eavesdropping or unwanted recording through spyware.
DIFFERENTIATION
· Can be deployed on any kinds of IoT devices since it is very small(2mm) and affordable · Post processing is not needed to meet the NIST requirements because it provides ultimate randomness · Compare to competitor's quantum random number generator, EYL's products are 3 others of magnitude smaller and cheaper · Other companies commercialized quantum random number generator using optical methods that provide quantum entropy at high speed, but they are prohibitively expensive and bulky.
REFERENCE CUSTOMERS and KEY PERFORMANCE
· Customer - Government security agency (no-name country) - Several private enterprises · Awards - "Diamond winner" of MassChallenge 2016 Boston - Selected as Disrupt100 company MISP, IoT Security competition "Top Award"

ABOUT COMPANY
Stealth Solution, located in Seoul, South Korea, is a startup that provides an intelligent security platform for a new security paradigm. They help companies invest in security infrastructure continuously, build a cyber-threat response environment and eliminate risk factors. Besides, Stealth Solution actively has responded to cyberattacks by applying next-generation MTD strategies to detect and block malicious attacks.
MAIN PRODUCTS
· Stealth Moving Target Defense(SMTD) SMTD is based on network host address mutation technology that mutates IP address and PORT number of network host continuously, network deception technology, and network reflection technology so that it makes impossible for attackers to identify the network host from the first attack stage.

022

DIFFERENTIATION
· Hide major server address The main server information can be hidden by continuously changing the properties of the attack surface(IP, Port, Protocol, Application, etc.) · Secure client communication The client that needs to connect according to the hiding of the server address guarantee a secure communication channel that is similar to VPN communication by creating separate hidden tunneling to continuously track the server address. · Hacking Prevention It can effectively defend against attacks in the reconnaissance and detection phases of the cyber kill chain. It is particularly effective to active and passive scanning attacks. · Zero Trust Block unauthorized client server access and dealing with insider threats through zero trust policy · Ensure server stability Adopting a secure gateway method of physical card type, which does not require installation of server agent, ensures server stability and installation of legacy solutions without compromise. · Advanced deception system Construction of an advanced deception system that provides improved functions such as behavior analysis and abnormal behavior detection of unauthorized/unauthenticated clients along with network address changing technology.
REFERENCE CUSTOMERS and KEY PERFORMANCE
· Companies might worry about network performance because of the characteristic of SMTD that mutates the server attributes. However, a test shows only 6% of network latency when SMTD runs every second. Also, if you increase the amount of the client, rate of latency decreased. · The overhead frequency when SMTD runs every second is only 0.04%. In other words, you take only 4 seconds more in the circumstance that you are originally able to download a 10GB file in 100 seconds. Considering that playing SMTD every second is quite unusual in the actual environment, it shows excellent network performance
