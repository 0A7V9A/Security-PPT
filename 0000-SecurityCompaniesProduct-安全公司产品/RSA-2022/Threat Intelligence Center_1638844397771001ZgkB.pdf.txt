It is a leader in China's threat intelligence industry. It is committed to providing innovative and leading threat intelligence capabilities in the field of national network security and enterprise network security, so as to improve the security operation level of users.
Threat Intelligence Capabilities
Machine-readable Threat Intelligence Collapse Detection Intelligence: Threat detection indicators, that is, attackers control remote commands used by the victim host and control server intelligence. IP Credibility Intelligence: Based on information from multiple dimensions of IP, determine if IP is at risk and is being used by dark industries and other network attack gangs. Document Credibility Intelligence: Determine whether a file is malicious, and the specific file type and attribution version. URL Intelligence: URL is a concise representation of the location and access method of obtaining resources on the Internet. It is the address intelligence information for sorting and analyzing standard resources on the Internet. Vulnerability Intelligence: refers to known or unknown vulnerabilities of various software and hardware systems, which are used in the risk assessment and vulnerability management stage.
Senior Threat Reader Report APT Intelligence Report: RedDrip Team provides services for tracking Gang background, combat technology, IOC intelligence, trend, etc. Security Notification Report: QI-ANXIN and third-party security notification services. Vulnerability Detail: Support vulnerability rating, account and other intelligence details services.
Cloud SaaS Service Platform Real time threat monitoring platform: a threat intelligence SaaS application created for the regulatory authorities, which provides a variety of capabilities such as high-level monitoring of network threats in the designated area, case extension analysis, sample depth analysis and so on. Threat Analysis Platform: provides multidimensional threat intelligence data and analysis application to help the security operators to identity and prioritize the event alarm and dig the deep implication of the attack event by correlation analysis. Threat analysis arsenal: it serves security service, security transportation, security analysts and various enterprise users. Multidimensional and all-round convenient tools support fast, efficient and accurate identification ability, and deeply guide security operators to study and judge the false alarm of existing malicious file alarm.
Threat Intelligence Platform Provide localized and all-round threat intelligence capabilities for enterprise users, including timely discovering key threats, screening or grading existing alarms, providing context for decision-making for event response, providing security early warning capabilities, providing self information operation capabilities, local mailbox detection and other services, so as to provide platform support for enterprises to build safety operation center.

Advantages

QI-ANXIN Threat Intelligence Center Product and Service Framework

1. Multi Source Advanced Sample Homology Analysis Capability
File sample homology analysis capability: Based on homology analysis technology, users can locate high-value samples in massive samples. Users can classify malicious families and cluster files. The analysis engine classifies samples in the system based on malicious families, marks homologous and similar samples according to cluster numbers, and clusters files from a macro perspective to help users quickly analyze files. APT Advanced threat discovery: Based on the machine learning malicious sample analysis engine, the samples in the system are classified based on the attack group, and the user can effectively analyze the association of the attack group information. Continuously track APT gangs in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula and other regions, Visualize the global map show the top APT organizations in the current popularity ranking, support retrieval and click on the map APT gang data, and provide detailed data in multiple dimensions.

2. Malicious Code Check Capability Strong anti-jamming: Sandbox core and fully autonomous intellectual property rights based on CPU virtualization characteristics can fundamentally solve the sample execution problems caused by sandbox HOOK conflict, kernel-driven detection and other factors. Strong detection power: strong adaptive ability to help users accurately make intelligent judgments in file judgment. Has multi-file Association logic, heuristic smart file extraction execution, file completion, determine URL link execution logic. The ability to run target samples by precisely selecting sandbox operating system environments, applications, and running parameters. High reliability: Ensure the stable operation of user information under the mechanism of high simulation and anti-circumvention. It has interactive artificial operation, working environment, operation track, network simulation and other simulation means. It also has anti-sandbox, delay acceleration, active trigger, behavior acceleration and other anti-circumvention technologies.
3. RAS Engine What is a RAS scanning engine: RAS is an integrated multi-core scanning engine developed by the RedDrip Team of QI-ANXIN Threat Intelligence Center. It improves file resolution capability based on metadata input of the OWL Depth File Resolution Engine, features and heuristic empirical rules based on a large number of manual analysis samples, and input deterministic or suggestive tags. Why RAS engine is needed: 1. RAS engine solves the problem of short boards in different detection engines, meets the needs of different sample rules extraction, and improves the adaptability of user sample rules; 2. To meet the needs of deep detection of composite documents and describe the parent-child relationship of files; 3. Secondary development can be carried out according to requirements, including custom virus library + engine logical control.
4. Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) Localized deployment: Implement intelligence landing and management to facilitate rapid threat detection and management using landing intelligence in the local environment. Local mail detection service: can quickly batch automate the detection of whether malicious mail, attachments are threats and other security risks, to improve the user's ability to detect mail information in depth.
5. Super Data Service Capability It has strong sample collection ability and leading network data in China, including ATP intelligence from hundreds of intelligence sources and many security research teams. At the same time, it is a member of Microsoft's MAPP partner and has a very rich base of data. It has enterprise level full data collection capability, closed-loop information processing capability and perfect information
6.Complete Product Support System Local and cloud high-performance API interfaces support user situation awareness, NGSOC, SIEM and other big data platform services. Standard STIX intelligence delivers linkage to traditional devices such as firewalls and gateways to support traditional products. Provide integrated support for security products through SDK, and open the core capability of QI-ANXIN threat intelligence to the ecosystem.
