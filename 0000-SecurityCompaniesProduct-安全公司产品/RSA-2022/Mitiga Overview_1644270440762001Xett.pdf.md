Cloud Incident Readiness, Response, Recovery, and Resilience

Company Overview

Mitiga's collaborative approach is disrupting the economic model for cloud and hybrid incidents.

Attacks on cloud and infrastructure aren't a matter of if, but when.
As attackers adapt their tactics to thwart security measures and organizations increasingly move applications and infrastructure to the cloud, it's essential to be both ready for a cloud or hybrid attack and as resilient as possible. Unfortunately, that readiness and resiliency is hard to achieve. · Just 8% of security leaders are fully confident in their organization's ability to identify the root cause of an attack* · In 2021, it took an average of 75 days* to contain a data breach · For organizations in the early stage of cloud modernization, it took 231 days to identify and 98 days to contain
a cloud-based breach
Challenge: Slow Incident Response
According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021, even organizations in the mature stage of cloud modernization took 59 days to contain a cloud breach. A cloud-based breach in public cloud cost $4.8M, private cloud $4.55M, and hybrid cloud $3.61M. Regardless of environment, detection and escalation accounts for 29% of the total cost, while another 27% comes from post breach response. The slower the response, the higher the cost.
