Our Perspective
With the proliferation of human and machine identities, the race to the cloud and the rise of remote working, protecting identity has never been more important. The key impediment to doing so is the fragmented way in which most organizations manage access rights. One Identity brings together the four core elements of identity security ­ Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), Identity and Access Management (IAM), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and Active Directory Management and Security (ADMS) ­ to help customers holistically address this challenge. We call this unified identity security.
Moving from a fragmented state to a unified approach to identity security delivers numerous operational benefits, such as correlating all identities, removing friction between formerly distinct technologies, and facilitating automation and orchestration. This model also provides a critical level of added protection. With 360-degree visibility, adaptive security controls, and the ability to apply analytics across all identities in the enterprise, organizations can verify everything before granting access to their most-critical assets. This level of response and control allows cybersecurity executives to shrink windows of exposure, move closer to achieving Zero Trust and improve their overall security posture.

Unified Identity Security Platform
One Identity's vision is not to simply help customers solve all their identity security problems with fragmented point solutions. We believe there is significant value in integrating these technologies into a single, cloud-first platform ­ what we call our Unified Identity Security Platform.

The foundation of our platform is in an identity-correlation system that delivers a consistent view across users, machine identities and accounts to help organizations move from a fragmented to a unified state. Workflow orchestration eliminates manual and error-prone activities; connectors deliver flexibility by bringing disparate applications and security ecosystems under a single point of control. Powering all of this is identity intelligence and analytics to help cybersecurity professionals get a clear view of their risk profile and take corrective actions as needed.
