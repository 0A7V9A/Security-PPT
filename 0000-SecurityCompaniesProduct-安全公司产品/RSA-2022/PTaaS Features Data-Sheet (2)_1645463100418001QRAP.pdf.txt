PENETRATION TESTING AS A SERVICE (PTAAS)
Better Manage Your
Vulnerabilities with PTaaS
Manage Findings and Remediation
All vulnerabilities are correlated, deduplicated, and accessible directly through ResolveTM with the ability to search, sort, query, and filter your data. All vulnerability findings are aggregated in real-time and include a detailed description, severity rating, impact analysis, and remediation instructions. It also includes hand-written reproduction steps to guide you to reproducing and remediating your vulnerabilities.
Program Management
The Program Management Dashboard houses all of your NetSPI engagements and reports on the status and results of your penetration tests. The dashboard also highlights the efficacy of each testing method (manual vs. Scan Monster vs. traditional single network scanners). Resolve enables clients to collaborate directly with their testing team on specific assessments, findings, instances, assets, and more. It also enables direct communication with your project manager to request additional assessments or make adjustments to upcoming assessments. This centralized communication reduces inefficient e-mail correspondence and streamlines communications among all stakeholders.
Reporting and Trend Analysis
Generate your own PDF reports on-demand. Access fully detailed vulnerability reports as well as executive summaries detailing at a high-level the results of the engagement. With Resolve you gain year-round trend analysis and access to dashboards tracking the state of your remediation efforts for all vulnerabilities.
Continuous Penetration Testing
As a PTaaS client, you can enhance your standard penetration tests with recurring touchpoints throughout the year. In addition to your deep-dive manual penetration tests, NetSPI can conduct additional testing in the time between your tests. PTaaS rolls these up into applications and networks, giving you all-time views of your findings, irrespective of the assessment they were found on.

Remediation Assignments and SLAs
PTaaS gives you the ability to assign SLAs and remediators to all vulnerabilities and manage them through the remediation life-cycle. Additionally, you can supplement NetSPI's assigned severity with your own rating allowing further customization of the vulnerability management process.
Persona Dashboards and Unlimited Access
PTaaS persona dashboards provide different data points and summaries based on the users role. It allows you to customize how each user views and digests the penetration testing data. Unlimited user counts allow you to add access for anyone (CISO, SOC, app owners, vulnerability managers, developers, etc.).
Custom Severities
NetSPI's severity rating may differ from an organization's internal vulnerability rating. To further customize Resolve, PTaaS allows you to define assigned severity for all vulnerabilities.
Data Analytics
Using the Data Lab query tool you have the power to create and save custom queries allowing you to interrogate your vulnerability data from multiple perspectives.
