Onspring Case Study: H&R Block Long-term GRC Program
H&R Block Used Quick Wins to Build a Long-term GRC Program in Onspring

OVERVIEW
H&R Block's comprehensive GRC vision was comprised of 13 wide-ranging programs spanning all three verticals of Governance, Risk & Compliance. These robust programs included training and awareness, vulnerability management, third-party risk, metrics, enterprise policies, and regulatory compliance.
Moving all 13 programs out of ServiceNow legacy software system and into Onspring required a strategy that not only delivered quick implementations with immediate ROI but a long-term approach for enterprise-wide value.
H&R Block successfully launched their first program in Onspring within 30 days while building rapport across teams and creating continuous support from executives to sustain long-term success.
