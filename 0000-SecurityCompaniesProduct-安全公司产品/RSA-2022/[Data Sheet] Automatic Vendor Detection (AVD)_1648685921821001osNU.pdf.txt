WHAT IS A SUPPLY CHAIN RISK SCORE?
Your security posture is never just your own security posture. It's a combination of yours, your vendors, and their vendors that make up an entire ecosystem.
SecurityScorecard's Supply Chain Risk Score calculates the combined risk of an organization and its entire digital supply chain. This takes into account multiple parameters, including infrastructure, paths to an organization, and how much risk each vendor can pose.
The Supply Chain Risk Score provides visibility into combined ecosystem risk, enabling you to understand and stay ahead of supply chain threats.
