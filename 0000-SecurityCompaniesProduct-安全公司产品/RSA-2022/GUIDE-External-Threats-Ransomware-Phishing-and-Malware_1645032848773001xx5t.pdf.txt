Checklists
External Threats: Ransomware, Phishing, and Malware
Looking for help with ransomware, phishing, and malware? Here are checklists to help.

External threats such as ransomware, phishing, and malware attacks are a daily occurrence for every organization. While defense against these attacks is improving, their quickly evolving nature means prevention is never guaranteed. SOC teams must be prepared to respond to an active attack at any time.
Defending against external threats is more than just choosing the right security solutions. It's also creating a security program that puts people, processes, and

technology together. The following checklist is meant to be a guide when defending and responding to external attacks.

Ransomware
According to Verizon's 2021 DBIR report, incidents of successful ransomware attacks doubled from 2020, making up 10% of all attacks publicly reported. While there are many potential reasons for the increase in ransomware, attackers continue to deploy ransomware because it returns a profit. With ransomware-as-service available on the dark web, attackers no longer need to be proficient in writing malicious code. In a matter of minutes, virtually anyone can initiate a ransomware attack that could pay for itself in days or hours.

Even the best detection and prevention tools on the market can fail to identify a file as malicious ransomware. To mitigate these cases, organizations must have a solid secondary behavior-based detection method, coupled with an automated recovery and response mechanism that enables them to limit damage and return to a trusted state fast without paying any ransom.

Checklist

External Threats

Detection  Analyze file, web, DNS, and endpoint activity for
behavioral anomalies to detect ransomware arriving on or operating from an endpoint
 Analyze the composition of any files moving onto a protected machine and if deemed malicious, block the file from either being copied to the machine or executing
 Extract key evidence and link to attach as evidence to a case
 Look for known ransomware techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) for visibility into assets with vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that attackers might exploit
Response actions  Suspend user: Lock the affected account(s)
 Reset password/expire password: Change password(s) for an affected account(s)

 Quarantine/isolate Host: Quarantine the affected asset(s)
 Get domain, URL, IP reputation: Determine the reputation of the URL, IP, and/or domain
 Block malicious domains, URLs, and/or IP addresses  Kill processes: Terminate the malicious processes on
the compromised endpoint(s) identified  Scan Host: Initiate antivirus scan on a machine  Search email by sender: Search for other users who
received the phishing email from the same sender  Delete emails by sender/message-ID: Proactively
delete malicious emails based on the sender or message ID from other users' inbox  Block sender: Block the sender's email address  Add hash to blacklist  Add asset to watchlist

Phishing
Phishing attacks typically involve social engineering, which is the use of deception to manipulate users into divulging their credentials by clicking a weaponized link or opening a malicious attachment.
Phishing is an entry point for many attacks and can lead to malware infection, lateral movement across the network, account takeover, data exfiltration, and more. With the high volume of threats and new phishing campaigns appearing daily, security teams require a means to stay ahead of attacks.
Detection
 Find phishing attacks through emails forwarded by employees or natively via behavioral analytics to automatically create an incident
 Check user website activity against whitelists and blacklists of known domains and senders, as well as analyze using machine learning with lexical analysis and substring searches for resemblance to popular domains
 Use behavioral analytics to identify unknown threats, establishing a baseline for typical domains or countries that a user normally receives emails from, and alerting on abnormal activity
 Check URLs against the list of top-ranked domains from the Alexa 1M and Majestic Million, as well as domains flagged as malicious by proxy logs

Response actions  Get domain, URL, IP reputation: Determine the
reputation of the URL, IP, and/or domain
 Get IP WHOIS: Collect contextual information about the IP address such as who it's registered to or the ASN
 WHOIS: Collect contextual information about the domain such as the age, when it was registered
 Detonate file in a sandbox: If the phishing email has email attachments, detonate them in a sandbox and get the reputation results
 Search email by sender: Search for other users who received the phishing email from the same sender
 Delete emails by sender/message ID: Proactively delete phishing emails based on the sender or message ID
 Extract key evidence from phishing emails such as file attachments and links to attach as evidence to an incident case
 Investigate other potential related events or embedded email functionality to communicate with users and assemble additional evidence
 Reduce potential attacker dwell time with integrated incident management and investigation

External Threats

Malware
A favorite tool in attackers' toolbox continues to be malware -- from trojans to more destructive malware families. Given its ability to carry out any number of tasks and the virtual unlimited variants available, attackers will use malware across the entire attack chain, from infiltration to data exfil.
Using advanced techniques, such as machine learning and AI, detection models can identify never-before-seen malware before it has an opportunity to carry out its objective. Detecting and preventing 100% of malware is not feasible, so it is critical organizations employ secondary behavior-based detection capabilities to catch malware that slips past their primary prevention layer.
Detection
 Utilize behavioral analytics and user context to find applications and/or code acting abnormally, indicative of the suspected app or file being malware
 Analyze web, DNS, and endpoint activities to rapidly detect malware arriving on an endpoint or operating from an endpoint
 Analyze the behavior of accounts associated with the device and the unique characteristics of those alerts
 Pay attention to frequent alerts with no other signal which are often deprioritized, where unique alerts with signs of compromise in surrounding activities rank at the top of the triage list
 Streamline investigations and reduce potential attacker dwell time with integrated incident management and investigation

Response actions  Leverage machine-built incident timelines to
investigate other potential related events, or embedded email functionality to communicate with users and assemble additional evidence  Extract key evidence and link to attach as evidence to a case  Suspend user: Lock the affected account(s)  Reset password/expire password: Change password(s) for the affected account(s)  Quarantine/isolate host: Quarantine the affected asset(s)  Get domain, URL, IP reputation: Determine the reputation of the URL, IP, and/or domain  Block malicious domains, URLs, and/or IP addresses  Kill process: Terminate the malicious processes on the compromised endpoint(s) identified  Scan host: Initiate antivirus scan on a machine  Search email by sender: Search for other users who received the malware from the same sender  Delete emails by sender/message-ID: Proactively delete malicious emails based on the sender or message ID from other users' inbox  Block sender: Block the sender's email address  Add hash to blacklist  Add asset to watchlist
