Ivanti and Zimperium have partnered to provide a complete enterprise mobile security solution that delivers sophisticated threat protection for the Everywhere Workplace. This solution guards against phishing, and it also protects and remediates against attacks at the device, network and application levels.
Together, Ivanti and Zimperium enable enterprises to manage and secure mobile devices against the broadest array of attacks. Zimperium continuously detects and analyzes threats and provides Ivanti with the visibility to enact risk-based policies to protect mobile devices from compromising the corporate network and its assets.
The integrated solution provides IT security administrators with a way to safely enable both Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), and strike the balance between empowering mobile employees to be more productive with the device of their choice, while at the same time securing mobile devices and the enterprise against advanced threats.

Key benefits
Built from the ground up for mobile devices, Zimperium's z9 Mobile Threat Protection engine uses machine learning technology optimized to run on the device without an internet connection. Its nonintrusive approach to securing the device provides protection around the clock without impacting the user experience or violating user privacy. Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) is integrated with the Ivanti UEM client, which enables admins to drive 100% user adoption.
Regulatory compliance
NIST 800.53 Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, provides a more holistic approach to information security and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which those systems operate ­ contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyberattacks and other threats. Zimperium's z9 MTD engine powers MTD and detects network public access attacks, malicious code to applications and OS, on-device incidence response and vulnerability scans of your mobile workforce.

NIST 800.124 NIST Special Publication 800-124 Rev. 2 section 4.2.3 states: "MTD systems are designed to detect the presence of malicious apps, network-based attacks, improper configurations and known vulnerabilities in mobile apps or the mobile OS itself." Zimperium's Mobile Threat Protection provides on-device, realtime, continuous monitoring device, OS, network, phishing and applications. In addition, Zimperium's z3A, advanced app analysis performs a 20-point validation on all apps within the environment and can detect unexpected interaction between apps, apps that contain flawed or misguided code, CVEs that have not been addressed or access to PII.
MITRE ATT&CK® framework A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. To counter the attacks, MTD premium app analysis helps detect and remediate the attack framework.

How Zimperium integrates with Ivanti:
Ease of deployment and upgrades Zimperium's z9 engine is already embedded into our UEM agent. This means the solution is already deployed to device, and only requires activation. The configuration is done by adding our UEM to zConsole and enabling activation from the UEM to start protecting devices. No user interaction is required, and no new application deployment is needed.
Protect your corporate infrastructure When MTD detects that a device has been compromised, it can provide quick remediation to thwart the attack. Based on the attack and the setting, Ivanti can perform myriad protective actions including terminating the network connection, denying specific IP/domains and enacting specific quarantine actions. In addition, the Ivanti server can enact risk-based compliance policies to remediate depending on the severity of the threat. The policies can temporarily disable the mobile device's connections to corporate services (email or other apps, Wi-Fi and VPN) or even remove enterprise applications from the device. These actions stop the spread of the infection and prevent risk to corporate data.
Alerting and reporting Ivanti provides comprehensive mobile threat forensics along with configurable end-user notifications and administrator alerts by attack type to suit the needs of any enterprise. Privacy data collection policies are provided to meet regional regulations as well.
