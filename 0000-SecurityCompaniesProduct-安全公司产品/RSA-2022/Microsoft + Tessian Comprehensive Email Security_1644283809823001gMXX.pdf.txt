TESSIAN SOLUTIONS BRIEF
Microsoft + Tessian: Comprehensive Email Security
SEGs are redundant and do not offer protection against advanced social engineering based attacks. Microsoft and Tessian together offer comprehensive email security to replace your SEG.
The Problem: SEGs are no longer fit for purpose in an increasingly complex threat environment
Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) are considered legacy IT technology. With the move of email to the cloud, enterprises have access to native SEG capabilities, including threat intelligence, in Microsoft 365. Enterprises integrate SEGs into their environments to improve email security, for spam filtering, as well as for malicious URL and attachment protection. SEGs typically offer the following features:  Malware protection  Spam protection  Basic phishing protection  Attachment sandboxing  URL rewriting/ Time of click protection  Link following/URL tracking  Email data loss prevention (DLP)  Archiving
"What we saw after our Proof of Value with Tessian was exciting, but also quite scary. We saw things that we didn't actually know were happening. Suddenly we had transparency and could see the true scope of the issues we had on email. But, we also saw how employee behavior changes with Tessian."
Cas de Bie
CIO at Cordaan

Key Shortcomings of SEGs:
IN-LINE, STATIC RULE BASED APPROACH The in-line gateway approach of SEGs renders them sitting ducks, unable to address any risk that bypasses the gateway. SEGs are particularly ineffective at protecting against advanced social engineering based attacks such as CEO impersonation, account takeover (ATO), business email compromise (BEC), spear phishing or insider threat detection.
NO ZERO DAY PROTECTION SEGs are notoriously unable to safeguard against zero day attacks because the threat engine relies on known threats only.
POINT OF FAILURE RISK SEGs represent a point of failure risk in your IT environment. On-premise SEG appliances are often housed in the same server rack or on the same premises as your email exchange server, which makes SEGs vulnerable to downtime and disaster events.
HIGH RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND UTILIZATION, WITH DECLINING EFFECTIVENESS Maintaining SEGs requires dedicated staffing resources to maintain the DNS and MX records, and to triage email threats through post-event threat hunting and forensics. The retroactive nature of threat detection in the current context of ransomware is accelerating the declining effectiveness of SEGs.
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND HIGH USER FRICTION Business interruption (i.e. broken email flow due to SEG misconfiguration) is a leading customer complaint. So too is the high user friction that SEGs generate by incorrectly blocking legitimate incoming email.

MICROSOFT + TESSIAN: COMPREHENSIVE EMAIL SECURITY

Sitting in-line as the gateway for all received and sent emails in the enterprise, a significant responsibility rests on the effectiveness of SEGs to ensure the integrity of email communication. SEGs prove to be relatively effective at spam filtering and the blocking of unsophisticated phishing attempts.
But due to the increasing sophistication of social engineering based attacks, the position and relevance of SEGs as the principal email security solution is rapidly diminishing. Advanced attacks are able to circumvent the static, rule-based defenses of SEGs. Once a threat has effectively circumvented the gateway, the threat actor is significantly closer to accessing an enterprise's crown jewels.
Threat actors are able to bypass SEGs because of the reliance on threat intelligence, which relies on known lists and signatures of already discovered threats. SEGs do not offer any protection against zero day attacks, and in fact represent a key point of failure in the growing security challenge of email delivered ransomware. Insider threat management is also limited. SEG's also do not offer Email DLP, and are therefore unable to protect you from misdirected email, the wrong attachment being emailed out, or sensitive data from being exfiltrated via email.
The legacy nature of SEGs has been carried into the cloud, too. Relaying Microsoft 365 email through a SaaS SEG solution increases the risk of business interruption due to the overly manual process of changing MX records to ensure email is routed to the correct server. Changing MX records also publicly discloses what email security solution is in use. The static nature also requires continuous maintenance and is ill-suited to organizations that require dynamic scaling. The archiving capability of SEGs is made further redundant by cloud hosted productivity suites like Microsoft 365 providing archiving natively. Simply stated, SEGs are no longer fit for purpose in an increasingly complex threat environment. This is why enterprises are consolidating their email security stack and selecting next-gen solutions that enhance Microsoft 365's native capabilities ­ enabling comprehensive protection through a defense in depth approach.
Enterprises might not be aware of the SEG redundancy in their IT environments. The typical enterprise is running a SEG in parallel to Microsoft 365 or some other cloud hosted productivity suite.
Microsoft 365 with the E5 licensing includes the following capabilities:

THE SOLUTION
Tessian + Microsoft
Microsoft alone does not guarantee against advanced email threats. Just like SEGs, significant gaps remain in Microsoft's ability to protect against advanced social engineering campaigns that can result in BEC, ATO, or zero day attacks.
This is where behavioral cybersecurity solutions like Tessian come into the fold, with its advanced, always-on threat detection and prevention capability. Through machine learning Tessian is able to build a contextual relationship of all end-user email behavior. From this the solution is able to understand normal email behavior by conducting a deep inspection of content using natural language process (NLP) and behavioral analysis. Tessian's algorithm is then able to detect and prevent threats that Microsoft or SEGs have failed to detect ­ all within 5 days of deployment.
Unlike the static nature of SEGs, Tessian is able to dynamically detect anomalous email behavior, whether it be inbound (i.e. advanced spear phishing attacks, CEO impersonation) or internal (i.e. insider threats) as it happens. With each threat detected and blocked, the algorithm and threat defenses become more resilient. We call this dynamic security.
Realize defense-in-depth and comprehensive protection by leveraging Microsoft with Tessian.

"After so many years using Mimecast, we knew its strengths and weaknesses and we had identified a clear gap. We wanted to fill that gap in the least intrusive way possible. After evaluating various tools, Tessian was a no-brainer."

THREAT VISIBILITY AND INTELLIGENT RISK MITIGATION
Gain visibility into your Human Layer risks
Threat visibility and intelligent risk mitigation are core features of the Tessian platform.
In order to protect against threats within organizations, Security and Risk Management leaders need visibility into key areas of risk. They need to know:
 What kinds of threats are the highest risk in your organization?
 Which departments and employees are most at-risk or likely to make a mistake?
 Where and how can you improve your security stack and improve safer email behavior?
Tessian provides unique insights with enriched risk profiles at the user, department, and company level. With increased visibility into risk areas and drivers, Security and Risk Management teams are able to prioritize mitigation actions and present results to company executives and board members, as evidence of technology reducing risk, not simply reporting it.

SECURITY AND AWARENESS TRAINING
In-the-moment contextual security
awareness training
The context-aware cybersecurity capability of Tessian extends to providing in-the-moment security awareness training to employees. When Tessian discovers malicious emails inbound or outbound, it displays contextual warning messages in a simple user friendly way with precise flag reasons to end-users educating them why the email has been identified as malicious.
The real-time security notifications help employees become better at identifying these threats over time, which improves the security posture of the company. While most organizations experience an average of 30% click through rate on simulated phishing exercises, Tessian clients see a less than 5% click through rate after deployment.
And because Tessian warns users only when true events are detected, employees are protected, without disruption to their day-to-day work, enabling clients to remain agile while staying safe.
