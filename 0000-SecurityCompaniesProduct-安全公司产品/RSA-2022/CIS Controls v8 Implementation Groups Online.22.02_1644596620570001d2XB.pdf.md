Implementation Groups

The CIS Critical Security Controls« (CIS Controls«) are internationally recognized for bringing together expert insight about threats, business technology, and defensive options into an effective, coherent, and simpler way to manage an organization's security improvement program. But in our experience, organizations of every size and complexity still need more help to get started and to focus their attention and resources.
To that end, we developed Implementation Groups (IGs). IGs are the recommended guidance to prioritize implementation of the CIS Controls. In an effort to assist enterprises of every size, IGs are divided into three groups. They are based on the risk profile and resources an enterprise has available to them to implement the CIS Controls. Each IG identifies a set of Safeguards (previously referred to as CIS SubControls), that they need to implement. There are 153 Safeguards in CIS Controls v8.
Every enterprise should start with IG1. IG1 provides effective security value with technology and processes that are generally already available while providing a basis for more tailored and sophisticated action if that is warranted. Building upon IG1, we then identified an additional set of Safeguards for organizations with more resources and expertise, but also greater risk exposure. This is IG2. Finally, the rest of the Safeguards make up IG3.
These IGs provide a simple and accessible way to help organizations of different classes focus their scarce security resources, and still leverage the value of the CIS Controls program, community, and complementary tools and working aids.

IG1 is the definition of essential cyber hygiene
and represents a minimum standard of information security for all enterprises. IG1 assists enterprises with limited cybersecurity expertise thwart general, non-targeted attacks.

CIS Controls v8 Implementation Groups

Essential Cyber Hygiene CIS Controls v8 defines Implementation Group 1 (IG1) as essential cyber hygiene and represents an emerging minimum standard of information security for all enterprises. IG1 is the on-ramp to the CIS Controls and consists of a foundational set of 56 cyber defense Safeguards. The Safeguards included in IG1 are what every enterprise should apply to defend against the most common attacks. For more information, visit www.cisecurity.org/controls.
