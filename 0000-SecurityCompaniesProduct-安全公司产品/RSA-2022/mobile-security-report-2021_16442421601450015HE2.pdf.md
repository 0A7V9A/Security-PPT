GLOBAL MOBILE SECURITY REPORT
2021

INTRODUCTION
2020's events have precipitated the transition to remote working, strongly increasing workforces' reliance on mobile devices. As organizations' routines and security perimeters crumbled, cybercriminals saw in the chaos an opportunity to seize. In the last 12 months, cyberattacks have flourished all over the world, and targeting mobile devices to reach organizations' most sensitive data is now more commonplace than ever. Mobile applications are at the center of mobile usages, and unsurprisingly they have been keeping for years the position of favored vector to compromise smartphones and tablets, counting as the source of 76% of mobile attacks in 2020. However, their tricks are constantly changing to bypass organizations' security gates, making it complex to detect and neutralize them before they do harm. By being part of a mobile security company that analyzes each year billions of security events collected through mobile devices and apps protected globally, Pradeo's researchers have the best spot to observe the mobile threat landscape. This report features their analysis of the currently most used attack techniques and latest trends. These statistics are based upon the analysis of billions of security events, and samples of 4 million mobile applications and 1 million mobile devices.

CHANCES YOUR SMARTPHONE HOSTS A SPYWARE ARE HIGH

To run its services, a mobile application requires to access some information on the device hosting it, including some about its user. While most apps could properly work by only accessing and using these data locally, 65% of them are actually programmed to send the collected information to a remote location.

The most leaked personal data are location details, contact lists, usages statistics and pictures, audio and video files.

This silent data exfiltration is often performed to monetize applications,

and in this case, details are sold to marketing companies that profile users.

By cross-checking information, we observe that 43% of all mobile apps

communicate data to servers belonging to one unique global company.

On the other hand, this data collection is also sometimes the result of

theft and spying, pure and simple.

EVEN TOP-RANKING APPS HAVE HIDDEN MOTIVES

On corporate devices, some categories of applications are more popular than others. News, Productivity, Business and Music apps are the most encountered ones. Like others, they access users' data, hence potentially endangering organizations' privacy in the process. Among the top 10 mobile apps in each of the categories above-mentioned, none embeds a malware, yet many exfiltrate data they should not. Moreover, it is interesting to compare actual data exfiltration to the permissions requested by the apps, since both results are utterly different.
The comparison clearly shows that basing an app's security status upon its permissions induces mostly false-positive alerts.

MALWARE IS AN EVER-RENEWING SECURITY CHALLENGE
A malware's lifecycle has different stages: At first, its combination of features is new and not classified in any antivirus database. Then, it starts getting recognition and is attributed with a name and a viral signature. To stay under the radar, cybercriminals keep renewing the code and functionalities of their malwares. Unknown malwares are only detected by solutions performing behavioral analysis, and standard mobile security services only relying on virus databases cannot cover them.

EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER RANSOMWARES AND FLEECEWARES

Ransomware attacks
Several European national cybersecurity agencies recently warned organizations about ransomwares. In the recent months, two new trends have emerged. On the one hand, ransomwares are now often used as part of large-scale attacks, sometimes prepared months in advance and targeting carefully selected organizations. Qualified as Big Game Hunting, these onslaughts are often carried out by teams of hackers who have more financial and/or human resources than the average.
The second trend is the opposite of the first. It is the widespread of Ransomware-as-a-Service offers on the dark web, aimed at people with little IT knowledge and looking for a simple and fast way to launch attacks. The Jigsaw ransomware, for example, is sold for about 3,000 dollars on cybercriminal forums. Much less powerful than Big Game Hunting, RaaS usually targets individuals or small businesses, randomly.

Fleeceware fraud
The most infamous fleeceware is Joker, a malware repeatedly found in a very large number of mobile apps on Play Store. Its main activity is to simulate clicks and intercept SMS to subscribe to unwanted paid premium services unbeknownst to users. By using as little code as possible and thoroughly hiding it, Joker generates a very discreet footprint that can be tricky to detect.
7% of mobile apps hide a fleeceware.

Ransomwares are now found in 1.1% of mobile apps, against 0.01% a year ago (+10900%).

They increasingly leverage mobile devices to

compromise organizations' systems.

Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may overwrite portions of disk data.
Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems.

MOST APPS AFFECTED BY COMMON CODE MALPRACTICES

Mobile applications can be vulnerable because of some errors in their code or in the libraries they embed. These vulnerabilities expose them to attacks. Hundreds of vulnerabilities are referenced by the US National Vulnerability Database, the OWASP mobile security project, USCERT, etc. to help developers building and maintaining secure mobile applications. Pradeo's security testing tool has detected at least one vulnerability in 57% of the apps it analyzed.

SQLite
The app uses SQLite Database and execute raw SQL query. An untrusted user input in raw SQL queries can cause SQL Injection.
ECB
The app uses the ECB mode in its encryption algorithm. The ECB mode is known for being weak, because it uses the same
encoded text for identical plain texts blocs.
Rootcheck
This app has root detection capabilities.

PHISHING KITS ARE FLOURISHING ON THE DARK WEB
As classified in the MITRE ATT&CK® matrix, phishing campaigns can serve two purposes: stealing information or having users install a malicious program. Today, 88% of spear-phishing on mobile devices is carried out through mobile apps. The campaigns are increasingly sophisticated, and a lot of mobile users are still unaware of their existence, hence easily falling in the trap. In 2020, 34% of employees clicked on the link showcased in a phishing attempt. A complementary study revealed that 19% of victims go through the process by providing their credentials or downloading the malicious program. As phishing is undeniably effective, the dark web is flourishing with phishing kits and credential databases for sale.
34% of employees are trapped by phishing attempts.

MANAGED MOBILE DEVICES RUN ON OUTDATED VERSIONS OF THEIR OS

On a regular basis, security holes are discovered in the code of operating systems. Once detected, OS publishers develop patches that they push to users through updates and simultaneously disclose the vulnerabilities (CVEs) existing in the former version. Once made public, cybercriminals can exploit outdated devices' vulnerabilities to gain extended rights and illegally access data or communications.

In corporate mobile fleets, most devices are outdated because they are either too old to support the newest versions or because administrators are holding back updates. The latest is currently happening in many organizations to delay the migration to Android Enterprise, which is mandatory from Android 10 onwards.

MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS ARE GROWING ALONG REMOTE WORKING

Nearly all organizations have recently been urged to embrace teleworking. As the workforce more often connects to networks outside its company's perimeter, hackers have more room to perform man-in-the-middle attacks than ever.
This type of attack consists in intercepting or altering a communication between two parties. It can lead to data theft or fraud when a transaction is performed by the mobile user while the attack happens.
Man-in-the-middle attacks are correlated with the tendancy to connect to open WiFis. In Asia and in the United States for example, as it is very common to use public networks, mobile fleets are more impacted by this threat.
Globally, MITM attempts have grown by 236% in the last year.
