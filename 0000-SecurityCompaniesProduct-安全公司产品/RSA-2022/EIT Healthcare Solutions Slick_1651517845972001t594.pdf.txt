ASSESSMENT & ADVISORY SERVICES
Penetration Testing
Identify real-world threats to your business and significantly mitigate risk. Performed in coordination with specific frameworks (e.g. HITRUST, PCI, SOC) that your company is working toward.
Assessment & Attestation
Sticking with a "checklist" only approach does nothing to decrease the risk to your organization. Our team of experts have an in-depth understanding of over 15 security, compliance, and regulatory frameworks. We discover the risks associated with your environment and align the implementation of these controls with their intent. Risks are identified early and communicated throughout the engagement to avoid disruptions in the assessment process.

Gap Assessment
Has the system been accurately scoped? Improper scoping wastes time, money, and effort. EIT will work with your
team to align customer-mandated security requirements with the storage/processing of said data.
Advisory & Remediation
EIT offers organizations strategic guidance to align product roadmaps with HIPAA and HITECH requirements, building turn-key, audit-ready system security packages.
Compliance as a Service
Having difficulty managing multiple security and compliance frameworks? EIT can establish an integrated compliance program that meets your organization's key
business and security initiatives.

A strong, "security first" brand attracts more customers because there is inherently less risk with working with a company that takes a security over compliance approach. Use your security qualifications to attract new customers.

HealthPointe engaged with EIT on a high priority HITRUST Certification project with some very tight deadlines. We were highly impressed with the skillset that EIT brought to the project. They managed to understand the project requirements very quickly and delivered high quality work on a tight deadline. We highly recommend EIT and have already scheduled more work with them on additional security certification initiatives.
