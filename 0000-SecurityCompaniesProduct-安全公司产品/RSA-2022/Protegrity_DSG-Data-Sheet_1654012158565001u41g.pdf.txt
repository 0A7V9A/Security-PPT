DATA SECURITY GATEWAY FOR AMAZON S3
Protect sensitive information transparently without altering applications or services
Files passed outside the enterprise in Amazon S3 often contain sensitive data, which will likely be subject to compliance, privacy, and business security requirements. Native Amazon course-grained protection secures entire files but provides only an inflexible, all-or-nothing approach to data protection. Precision protection through Protegrity provides far more flexibility and secures specific sensitive data while allowing access to other data within the file.
Protegrity Data Security for Amazon S3 is a high-performance gateway solution that protects sensitive data within files. Delivered as a software appliance and as a containerized solution, the Data Security Gateway protects data within files being created or updated within the S3 environment without disruption to users.

Beyond Native S3 File Security Data Security Gateway for Amazon S3 provides advanced security for specific content within files. As a file enters or leaves Amazon S3, sensitive data is parsed and protected/unprotected using built-in encryption, tokenization, hashing, or masking routines. This process renders specific fields unreadable to users depending on their role defined in the data security policy. Secured files can then be moved to any other instance or platform with the security in-tact.
The Protegrity Data Security Gateway from Amazon S3 secures sensitive information and protects it as it moves over the network and among applications, business processes, and users. The sensitive data adheres to strict, centrally-managed policies to address security, privacy, data residency, and compliance requirements without affecting the data transparency or usability. The gateway polls for file activity to integrate seamlessly with any S3 application without modification.

Multiple Protection Methods for Sensitive Data Protect sensitive files while utilizing data-centric protection for specific file contents with GPG. Sensitive data is encrypted or tokenized using industry-leading AES encryption and the most advanced and secure tokenization technology on the market ­ Protegrity Vaultless Tokenization (PVT).
The standards-based AES 256-bit encryption is FIPS-compliant and is trusted by many government and civilian applications worldwide.
PVT is Protegrity's patented tokenization solution, which substitutes sensitive data with randomlygenerated values while preserving the original data type and length. PVT is ideal for organizations with strict data residency requirements and those that want to go a step beyond encryption in protecting their data.
