SD Elements is quite unique. It is exactly what we needed to expedite and enable our teams' efforts in releasing secure products. Our security champions and development teams saw firsthand how they can easily and quickly receive a tailored set of security requirements and clear development guidance. Since then, using SD Elements in their product development work has been a positive experience for them. Best of all, they've been shipping secure products with reduced time to market.
