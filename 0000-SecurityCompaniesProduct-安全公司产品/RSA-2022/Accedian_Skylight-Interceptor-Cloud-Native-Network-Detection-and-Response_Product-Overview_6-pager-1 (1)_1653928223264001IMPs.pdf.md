Product Overview
For Threats That Lurk in the Deep Skylight InterceptorTM
Cloud-Native NDR
Skylight Interceptor is a SaaS Cloud-Native Network Detection and Response (NDR) solution with real-time network detection to respond to increasingly sophisticated threat tactics with confidence.
Vigilant Detection for Threat Insights Correlated alerts and attack progression
Don't wait until it is too late. Virtualized and hybrid cloud networks are increasingly complex and it is easy to miss threat actors that lurk in your network.
Skylight Interceptor remains vigilant, collecting and correlating metadata from network packets from all your transations. The tracking of attack progression utilizing the MITRE ATT&CK framework lets your team easily visualize what is happening across the network to detect threats.
Benefits
Single platform for performance and security Multi-use sensors
Deploy where others can't 100% end-to-end visibility with flexible sensors
Skylight Interceptor sensors are easy to deploy where you most need them to provide deep visibility into complex cloud network flows. They capture and correlate metadata from both north-south and east-west traffic that traverses your network and across your clouds. No need to spend on storing full network packets for investigations. Faster detection and more cost effective threat hunting and forensics with optimized metadata collection.
Skylight Interceptor monitors traffic and creates behavioral models to detect any dangerous or suspicious anomalies. Alerts are correlated to create incidents, providing the context you need to understand and respond to attacks of all types.
Why NDR?
Your team will be better prepared for any situation since NDR solutions inform incident response (IR) workflows by providing:
1. Scope, severity, and the probability of an unusual event being malicious
2. Incident reporting based on correlated events and alerts of suspicious behavior
3. Insights for an appropriate course of action for responding to threats
4. The ability to see network threats such as insider threats that typically are difficult to detect with traditional security tools

The Right Response is Critical When Your Network is Being Targeted

Detection
· Receive early indicators of suspicious behavior
· Faster detection with real-time metadata
· Actionable insights from prioritized incidents

Threat Hunting
· Find hidden threats with extensive metadata
· Reveal threat patterns using MITRE ATT&CK framework
· Close security gaps proactively

Forensics
· Easy collection, storage, and retrieval capabilities
· Reduce costs for preservation of evidence
· Satisfy investigations with rigor from metadata collection

Vigilant Detection
· Network metadata reveals every detail of every action taken in your network across all your users, services, and servers. Always on and always correlating.
· Automatically track every device in your network so that you can identify potentially dangerous actors within your network. · Meaningful alerts with severity levels help guide IT and security teams to what requires immediate action.
Intelligent Threat Hunting
· Strict detection can lead to a high number of false positives so Skylight Interceptor tracks relevant activity and correlates to network elements to create context and more relevant alerts so your team knows what they need to focus on.
· Alerts are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to make it easier to interpret threat activity and plan for appropriate remediation. Alerts are reported based on severity and the implied objective of the tactics identified.
Forensics
Breaches are inevitable in today's world so gathering evidence for insurance claims or for legal procedures against insiders or criminal investigations is necessary. To be prepared you need a tool that is collecting the information that you may need at all times and organizing it in a fashion that allows experts to build a story of what happened. Contextual evidence that has the time and place and the how and why is crucial to determine what happened and how.
Skylight Interceptor rigorously collects data directly from the network that will satisfy investigations. The metadata is collected and correlated such that it is easy for your forensic team to collect, store and retrieve the information they need. A metadata-based NDR solution, like Skylight Interceptor, reduces your storage and operating costs yet provides the power to dive as deep as your Forensic team needs to find answers.

Actionable Insights from Network Metadata
Accedian network sensors collect real-time traffic behaviors and create actionable insights from network packet metadata. The collection and analysis of network metadata creates context. Context will eliminate noisy alerts and identify malicious behaviors that need immediate investigation and possible remediation. The insights from network packet metadata deliver a more accurate picture than just Netflow without the expense of collecting and storing full packets. NDR is necessary to see any manipulation of data communications by threat actors that most EDR or XDR solutions will miss. With Accedian Interceptor NDR you can complement any security stack and gain additional insights for any type of threat from ransomware to insider threats. With metadata you have immediate visibility even to zero-day threats to see if newly identified vulnerabilities have been exploited.

Incidents: · Grouping of contextual alerts · Reduces alert fatigue · Visual insights based on
MITRE ATT&CK framework · Speed & accuracy of problem
communication
Real-time analysis: · Extracting critical value from
packets (metadata)

Alerts: · Reduce noisy alerts · More context
Raw traffic: · 100% of tranactions · L2 thru L7 · No blind spots

Key Detection Features: Vigilant Detection of Beaconing with Machine Learning
Skylight Interceptor Leverages Machine Learning to Detect Beaconing

Figure 2: Example of detection of beaconing
Detect Command and Control(C2) Beaconing is increasingly difficult to detect as threat actors obfuscate their activity. Therefore it is necessary to use machine learning to observe and correlate behaviors across time and across your network to identify any patterns that may indicate beaconing. While in many systems this can lead to a high number of false positives, Skylight Interceptor combines detection techniques to identify and validate beaconing to reduce the number of false positives.

More than 20 Beaconing Features, including: · Beaconing detections by time · Beaconing Detections by packet size · DGA Detection · Multiple suspicious DNS behavior · HTTP/TLS malware · Protocol or port mismatch
e.g. TLS using port 53 (DNS) to pass through a firewall · And more ...

The MITRE ATT&CK* framework is a valuable tool to interpret the intent of threat actors and trace their actions. Mapping to the framework allows for network alerts to be interpreted with context relative to other network activity and identify high priority threats that need immediate attention.
