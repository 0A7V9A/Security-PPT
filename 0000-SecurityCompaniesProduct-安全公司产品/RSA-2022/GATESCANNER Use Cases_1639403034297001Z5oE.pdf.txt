CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Case Study
Proven Technology Founded in 2013, Sasa Software successfully protects governmental agencies, defense contractors, nancial institutions, public utilities and healthcare enterprises.
Independent tests demonstrate GateScanner® prevents up to 99.9% of undetectable threats*
Industry Recognitions

The Challenge
Critical infrastructures are under constant threats from State and non-State actors attempting to undermine their operations with increased exposure due to limitations in deploying traditional Cyber security technologies on critical appliances (SCADA, ICS, PLCs). Despite the risks, the organizations must securely transfer les into OT networks, including software/ rmware updates and productivity documents. Critical organizations must comply with regulatory requirements, such as NERC CIP-003-7 for processing of portable media.

Awards

The Technology
GateScanner® Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) ensures security by treating every le transferred into the OT network as suspicious, performing deep threat scans and restructuring, transforming les into a safe and neutralized copy. GateScanner® prevents advanced undetectable malicious code attacks, including APTs and ransomware while maintaining full le delity, visibility, and usability.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
The Solution
Geographically distributed, centrally managed GateScanner® kiosks, together with GateScanner® Injectors for unidirectional le transfers into the air-gapped networks. Kiosks are deployed at the company's international manufacturing sites and managed at the Israeli HQ.

Work ow
Users select les from detachable media at a GateScanner® Kiosk. Files are copied into the kiosk and undergo deep scans for known threats with multiple True Type Engines and Multiple AV engines. Malicious and suspicious les are blocked. Files undergo additional disarming according to a designated policy. The disarmed les are transferred uni-directionally into the operational network via GS Injector. Files are saved to a network share, or to the user's home drive. The user received a noti cation once the scan has completed. Kiosks are centrally managed at the company's HQ with logs sent to their SIEM.

Case Study

Proven Technology
Founded in 2013, Sasa Software successfully protects governmental agencies, defense contractors, nancial institutions, public utilities and
healthcare enterprises.
Independent tests demonstrate GateScanner® prevents up to 99.9% of undetectable threats*
Industry Recognitions

The Challenge
We live in a world of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. APTs, ransomware, and other malware continually evade detection based technologies. Inside of the organization, users inevitably open les containing threats, leading to IT security incidents. Healthcare is the most targeted yet underprepared genre of critical infrastructures, su ering from a deluge of publicized ransomware attacks and data breaches. Healthcare organizations face signi cant direct and indirect costs from data losses and regulatory violations (e.g. HIPAA).
The Technology
GateScanner® Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) by Sasa Software treats every incoming le and email as suspicious, performing deep threat scans, transforming les into a safe, neutralized and harmless copy, that ensures security. GateScanner® prevents unknown and undetectable malicious code attacks, including ransomware, while maintaining full usability, functionality and visibility of the les.

HEALTHCARE
The Solution
Assuta deployed multiple GateScanner® solutions (Mail, Secure Browsing). With email and browsing accounting for over 90% of malicious attacks, the solution dramatically reduced Assuta's exposure to potential cyber-attacks. Since all emails and les are disarmed, the solution reduces exposure to potential employee negligence, greatly leveraging their extensive employee security awareness training.

Work ow
GateScanner® Mail Customer's secure mail relay directs to GateScanner® Mail. GateScanner® Mail intercepts the SMTP tra c, and deconstructs the .eml les according to RFC2822. Every embedded email element undergoes deep scanning for known threats and is disarmed according to a designated pro le. The neutralized .eml is reconstructed, and the SMTP tra c is forwarded to the customer's mail server.
GateScanner® Secure Browsing Users access the internet inside of a 3rd party remote browsing isolation solution (Cigloo). Downloads are saved in an isolated environment. Files are securely released from the isolation solution using a GateScanner® API connection. The disarmed les are delivered to the user's desktop.

Tamir Ronen, CISO of Assuta Medical Centers testi ed, "In recent months, we have been the target of several ransomware attacks, including the notorious `Petya' strain. Fortunately, GateScanner® prevented these kinds of attacks, protecting us from being exposed to system downtime and data breaches. With Sasa Software's solutions, we feel much more secured even from unknown and undetectable malicious attacks."
