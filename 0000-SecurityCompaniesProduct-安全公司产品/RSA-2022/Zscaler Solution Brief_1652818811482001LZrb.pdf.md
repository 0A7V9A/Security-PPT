Centralize visibility and simplify policy management with Tufin-Zscaler Cloud Firewall integration

Today's workforce is globally distributed and employees are working from everywhere. With more workloads and applications now in the cloud, keeping the enterprise secure can be a challenge, as employees go directly to the Internet, bypassing traditional security controls. Managing security policies via siloed tools leads to incomplete visibility, and complex, time-consuming daily operation.

Tufin's integration with the Zscaler Advanced Cloud Firewall, part of the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, provides admins with centralized visibility into Zscaler Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) policy rules alongside other vendors' policies, to help simplify and standardize security policy management across the hybrid cloud, directly from the Tufin console.

The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange provides a full security platform in the cloud, allowing your entire workforce to be secure, regardless of their location. Zscaler ensures users have consistent protection no matter where, or on what device, they connect from. Zscaler Cloud Firewall enables fast and secure off-network connections and local Internet breakouts for all your user traffic, without appliances. Zscaler Cloud Firewall elastically scales across all ports and protocols to handle all your cloud application traffic.

Key features include: Rule Viewer Tufin's Rule Viewer provides network administrators an instant view of Zscaler Cloud Firewall rules directly from the Tufin console, for fast analysis. Users can view rule attributes--sources, destinations, users, applications. The Rule Viewer also provides rule metadata, such as when the rule was last modified, the certification status if rule certification is being enforced via Tufin, and if the rule is overly permissive and should therefore be modified or removed.

Rule Change Tracker To ensure continuous compliance and enable faster troubleshooting, Tufin monitors and highlights Zscaler Cloud Firewall rule changes--what was changed, when, by whom, and whether there's a comment or a reference associated with it. Tufin records every policy revision, maintaining a complete policy history as it evolves over time. Administrators can quickly retrieve and view the Zscaler policy as it existed at a previous point in time. A side-by-side comparison helps admins review changes to identify and fix misconfigurations. This can be invaluable when a change unexpectedly blocks access to a critical asset, enabling auditors to immediately view what has changed since the last audit.
