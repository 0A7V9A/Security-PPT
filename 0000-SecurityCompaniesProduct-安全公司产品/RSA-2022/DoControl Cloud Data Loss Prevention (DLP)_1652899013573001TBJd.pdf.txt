DoControl for Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)


The Challenge
Data loss prevention (DLP) tools and processes aim to prevent sensitive data from becoming lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. Traditional DLP programs are struggling to achieve desired outcomes due to the natural evolution of how sensitive data and files are
" " accessed, manipulated, and shared. Every flavor of an as a Service offering has been
increasingly adopted to enable businesses to become more agile. In the process, the IT estate has become significantly more complex, making traditional approaches to DLP less effective. The end result is a high-maintenance program that overwhelms teams with a significant
; amount of false positives and repeat offenders on a daily basis taking the time and focus .
 away from security events that present material risk to the business
Software as a Service (SaaS) applications are a critical egress channel for modern businesses that are often outside the scope of traditional DLP programs. To help drive business
G enablement, organizations leverage multiple content and collaboration tools (i.e. oogle M B Drive, icrosoft OneDrive, ox, and Slack). Data is both created and exchanged by internal
and external users within these applications, which makes preventing the loss and misuse of sensitive data a challenge at scale. Today, there is more data to steal and more places to
M q steal it from. odern businesses re uire a scalable solution that provides secure access to
sensitive files and prevents intentional or accidental data loss within SaaS environments.
The solution
DoControl Cloud DLP provides granular access controls that detect and prevent the loss, leakage and misuse of sensitive data within business-critical SaaS applications. Organizations pursuing a cloud-first strategy can now consistently secure access to sensitive files and data, both at rest and in motion, throughout the disparate applications being utilized by the business. so that sentence should read: Files that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and Payment Card Industry (PCI) information are automatically scanned throughout all structured, semi-structured and unstructured data within the SaaS application estate. All sensitive data is identified, and the risk of data exfiltration or leakage is remediated automatically through the combination of rich end-user behavioral analytics and dynamic DLP policy enforcement.

benefits
1 High-impact, lowmaintenance solution to prevent the loss, leakage and misuse of sensitive data within business-critical SaaS applications
2 Centrally enforce dynamic DLP data access control policies to reduce the risk of data exposure
3 Rich end-user behavioral analytics to help prevent the risk of malicious insiders from exfiltrating sensitive company data
4 Streamline incident response efforts through an exhaustive audit trail of end-user SaaS events and activities
5 Enforce data-handling controls and measures to comply with data protection and privacy regulations

how it works
DoControl extensively monitors all SaaS data movement in real time, and automatically creates relationship graphs to track communication patterns. Sensitive data is discovered and scanned in parallel, classifying the files and content types that are relevant to each organization. Secure workflows are established and triggered automatically by events that present a risk of data loss. The business context for each identity and asset is aggregated, providing more accurate

alerting and clearer remediation paths. By leveraging the business-context, DoControl provides full visibility and insight into which actions present actual risk, versus events that are standard business practice.
Foundational Cloud DLP Capabilities:
Manage: DoControl provides the foundational technology and process requirements to manage a high impact, low maintenance DLP program. Security teams can define enterprise data usage policies, report on policy violations, and implement secure workflows on a low code/no code platform that automatically prevents the exfiltration of data. DoControl is a completely event-driven platform that leverages SaaS application metadata as sources, allowing security teams to better understand when data is at risk within their SaaS environment. The solution helps streamline incident response efforts by providing a deep audit trail of internal user and external collaborator activities, detecting anomalies and high-risk SaaS events, as well as both automated and self-service remediation.

Discover: DoControl's sensitive data scanning service is a natural-language processing (NLP) tool that uncovers valuable insights and connections through machine learning. The scanning service processes text within cloud application files

and documents to extract key phrases, entities and sentiment which can then be further analyzed. Files and documents

are automatically scanned throughout all structured, semi-structured and unstructured data types. Organizations can

protect and control who has access to data by identifying and redacting sensitive information. Security teams can

classify the sensitive information that is relevant to their business, and from there create dynamic DLP policies through

DoControl's Security Workflows engine. The combination of DoControl Cloud DLP's file-scanning and data access

workflows enable organizations to adhere to stringent compliance and regulatory requirements.

Monitor: The DoControl analytics service provides security teams the context to distinguish which activities are "trusted" and which present a risk of data loss. Every SaaS interaction is tracked and monitored, and a baseline of "normal" activity is established for each individual user. Any deviations from that baseline or indicators that present a risk of data loss are detected and blocked. The DoControl analytics engine combines past end-user behavioral patterns with deterministic behaviors to prevent malicious insiders from exfiltrating business-critical data. Sensitive files are automatically isolated in the event of unauthorized access attempts. DoControl's data access anomalies can also be fed directly into existing SIEM/SOAR technologies and correlated with other detections for a more holistic view of DLP security events.

Protect: Dynamic DLP policies can be implemented across any application or use case, providing a more effective and targeted DLP strategy that minimizes false positives. Security teams can take a "risk-based approach" to DLP by applying specific policies to groups, domains, and individuals based on risk. Access can be provided and revoked on-demand, and the principle of least privilege can be enforced at scale via DoControl's Security Workflows. Triggered by hundreds of SaaS event types, Security Workflows enable consistent, granular, and customizable data access controls to protect sensitive data and address a vast number of DLP use cases. Policies can be configured to distribute automated notifications via Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email to alert specific personas (i.e. security teams, business line managers, or individual actors) on policy violations. Overtime, DoControl will intelligently recommend policies to empower security teams to fine-tune their DLP workflows.
