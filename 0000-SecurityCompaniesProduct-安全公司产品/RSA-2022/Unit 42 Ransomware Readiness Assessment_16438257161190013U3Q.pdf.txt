Threat actors can dwell in networks for months before encrypting files. The Complete Ransomware Analysis addresses this challenge with a ransomware-focused compromise assessment. We'll work with you to scan endpoints in your environment, review forensic artifacts, and collect endpoint telemetry to uncover evidence of malicious activity often associated with the early stages of the ransomware lifecycle.
Compromise Assessment with Cortex XDR
The Unit 42 Compromise Assessment is designed to identify evidence of historical or indicators of ongoing compromise. Unit 42 IR experts will analyze endpoint forensic artifacts and telemetry to search for the early stages of the ransomware lifecycle. We hunt for indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to sophisticated ransomware threat actors, including unauthorized access, use of PowerShell post-exploitation frameworks, and precursor malware that often leads to the installation of ransomware.
· Outcomes: Detailed analysis of client's networks and endpoint behaviors to determine whether there is evidence of unauthorized access or activity.
· Services: Our IR experts will perform a detailed analysis of forensic artifacts and e ndpoint telemetry to determine whether there is evidence of malicious activity caused by ransomware threat groups, such as: · Unauthorized access to the environment · Malicious software and malware persistence · Lateral movement and remote execution · Credential theft · Data exfiltration or sabotage
· Deliverables: You'll get a report with findings and strategic recommendations for control enhancements based on empirical observations, configuration settings, and opportunities to reduce your attack surface.
Cortex® XDRTM is the industry's first extended detection and response platform that integrates network, endpoint, cloud, and third-party data to stop sophisticated attacks.
