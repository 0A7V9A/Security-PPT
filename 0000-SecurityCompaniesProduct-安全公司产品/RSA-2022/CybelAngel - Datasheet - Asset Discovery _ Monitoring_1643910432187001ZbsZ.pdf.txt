ASSET DISCOVERY AND MONITORING
Prevent attacks against vulnerable shadow assets

Is your digital infrastructure fully protected against hackers? Unsanctioned assets, decommissioned services and partners' vulnerable products extend your attack surface outside of your purview. These shadow assets may remain invisible to you, but not to your attackers; 30% of successful cyber-attacks target vulnerable shadow assets (Gartner).
Traditional vulnerability management solutions are incapable to guarantee the safety of shadow assets at scale. Hence organizations worldwide rely on CybelAngel to prevent harmful attacks by detecting and securing vulnerable shadow assets before they are breached.
