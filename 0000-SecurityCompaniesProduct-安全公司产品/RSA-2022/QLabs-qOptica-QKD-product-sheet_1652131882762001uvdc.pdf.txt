Quantum Key Distribution

A significant step towards providing a quantum safe crypto environment

Fast exchange of secure keys, protected by the laws of physics

Continuous Variable QKD fiber optic and free space

QKD Overview Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a point-to-point protocol that uses specialised hardware to share secret keys over an optical link (fibre or freespace). Secrecy of the keys is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics-- the system continuously estimates the maximum amount of information that could have been obtained by an eavesdropper, and only outputs keys when it can exploit an information advantage.

Types of QKD There are two main approaches to QKD that leverage, respectively, the particle or wave characteristics of the quantum information carrier.

· D iscrete Variable QKD (DV-QKD) (particle): information can be encoded on the physical properties of single-photons, and measured with single-photon detectors.
· C ontinuous Variable QKD (CV-QKD) (wave): information can be encoded onto the amplitude and phase quadratures of a coherent laser, and measured with coherent detectors.

Source Detector Theoretic Secure

DV-QKD Single photons/attenuated laser Single-photon detectors Yes

CV-QKD Weakly modulated laser Coherent detectors Yes

qOptica Benefits QuintessenceLabs offers CV-QKD technology with built-in advantages in terms of cost, form factor, and performance:

· Performance: The use of coherent signal encoding enables high throughputs that are not limited by single-photon generation or detection. Moreover it allows for daylight operation over free space optical links.
· Cost: Compatibility with current telecommunication technologies, such as telecommunication encoding, transmission and detection techniques, as well as the ability to use standard fiber connections, allow for cost effective systems.

Quantum Safe Architecture QKD by itself does not solve the quantum security challenges faced. It needs to be part of an integrated solution generating, sharing and managing encryption keys.
QuintessenceLabs' quantum safe crypto solutions are a part of a full technology stack including:
·True Quantum Random Number Generator
· Quantum Key Distribution · P ost quantum crypto-agile
key management with hardware root of trust and quantum entropy · S ecure replication of quantum keys between key management nodes over a VPN link that is itself secured by quantum keys
