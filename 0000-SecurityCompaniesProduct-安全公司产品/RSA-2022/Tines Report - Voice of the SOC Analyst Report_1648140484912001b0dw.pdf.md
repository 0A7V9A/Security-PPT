A word from
 Eoin Hinchy

Security teams are being prevented from doing their best work.

While under-staffing and low budgets have always been challenges for any type of team, security teams are uniquely affected by repetitive, manual tasks, which in turn keep them from working on higher-impact projects that contribute to their organization's overall  security posture.

In my fifteen years of being a security practitioner, working on incident response and leading security teams, I witnessed over and  over again that in the SOC, there's too much work and not enough staff. More specifically, I saw overworked analysts so consumed with tedious, repetitive tasks that it led not only to burnout, but to human error that could cost a company millions.

The analysts I worked with weren't the only ones facing these challenges, and I wasn't the only security leader trying to find solutions to help my team do their best work.

While we generally know the day-to-day struggles analysts face, there's a lack of current data to give us a clear picture of what it's like to be an analyst today. So we conducted a survey that aimed to understand them better: "Voice of the SOC Analyst."

We found that while SOC teams are passionate and engaged in what they do, they're challenged with endless manual tasks, understaffed teams, inefficient processes, and too many alerts --  all preventing them from doing more highquality work.

Our goal with this project is to help security leaders recognize what they can do to streamline their processes, decrease burnout, increase retention, and create better overall work environments for their analysts.

We hope you utilize these findings and data as you make your way through 2022.

A word from Eoin Hinchy

Key findings

Here are a few of the insights we learned from the security analysts we surveyed:

1
71% of analysts experience some level of burnout.

2
Reporting, monitoring, and  detection are top tasks consuming  an analyst's time.

3
Spending time on manual work is an analyst's top frustration.

4
However, 66% believe that half of  their tasks to all of their tasks could be automated today.

5
64% say they're likely to switch jobs  in the next year.

6
Coding is the top skill needed to succeed as an analyst.

Methodology and participant demographics

Part one
Job satisfaction
 and workloads
Security analysts play a vital role in ensuring that their organizations stay safe and secure. But barriers to their work, like a lack of staff, overwork, and tedious tasks are causing frustration and burnout. In order to understand better how security leaders
can solve their team's pain points, we first have to start with a baseline of how analysts are faring today.

Summary

Top three skills needed to succeed as an analyst

30.1%

13.5%

10%

#1: Learning to code
The number one skill identified is learning to code, according to nearly one-third of respondents. While it may seem unrelated to the day-
to-day tasks, analysts see that knowing how to code will
help with task automation.

#2: Learning computer forensics techniques
The second most valuable skill will be learning computer forensics techniques, as knowing the process of
recovering data from crashed servers and drives after a failure or attack is a critical skill to helping analysts uncover what went wrong.

#3: Knowing how to operationalize Mitre
ATT&CK
The third most valuable skill will be knowing how to
operationalize Mitre ATT&CK , or knowing how to do threat intelligence and modeling in order to be more proactive
against attacks.

1 Job satisfaction and workloads

However, instead of being a coding wizard, there are options for no-code automation, meaning that analysts can spend more time on developing skills directly related to security analysis.

Part TWO
Where time goes
Many security analysts spend time on tedious, mundane tasks that are necessary yet of low-impact for the SOC team. This also keeps
analysts from engaging in more high-impact work for their organizations. But what exactly are these tedious tasks, and how much time are they taking from analysts' workloads? This section
gives us some insight into where the SOC team's time goes.
2 Where time goes

Top five tasks consuming the most time

50.4%
#1: Reporting
The number one most time-consuming task is reporting. Whether it's capturing notes and metrics related to cases, analyzing team performance, or demonstrating value to leadership, reporting matters -- but it's not supposed to be the main part of the job.

46.6%
#2: Monitoring
The next most time-consuming task is monitoring for threats and alerts. While a critical part of the role of a security analyst, the concern here is that 71.6% of respondents are Level 2 and 3 analysts, who are spending most of their time
doing front-line monitoring.

38.2%
#3: Intrusion detection
The task that analysts spend the most time on next is intrusion detection.

13.5%
#4: Detecting
Followed by general detecting.

10%
#5: Operations or ShiftOps
Rounding out the top five tasks are operations or ShiftOps tasks.

Top three tasks analysts enjoy the least

17.7%

16.2%

13%

#1: Triage
Number one task on the list was triage. While triaging is a core skill of a security analyst,
and while many enjoy it because of its detective work,
the far less enjoyable parts include manually
deduplicating alerts, repeated similar cases, and too much
noise.

#2: Reporting
The next task that analysts enjoy the least is reporting, which, as we saw above, is the task they're spending the most time on during the day. Again, reporting matters, but
streamlining reporting through automation can help
reduce time spent and increase job satisfaction.

#3: Monitoring
Finally, analysts also least enjoy monitoring, which is the second most time-consuming task in an analyst's day. Like reporting, much of this kind
of front line manual monitoring can be automated
to free up analysts to focus on tasks that have more
impact and that they enjoy.

Which of these tasks do you enjoy the least?

Top five key metrics used to measure job performance

54.1%
#1: Mean time to investigate
For the majority of analysts, the top measure of their job performance is mean time to investigate.
So SOC teams should look for ways to reduce time between detection and investigation.

43.8%
#2: Number of alerts
The second metric they're most measured on is number of alerts. SOC teams should focus on ways to reduce false positives and reduce alert
fatigue amongst their analysts.

37.6%

34.2%

#3: Mean time to respond
The third most-used metric is mean time to respond, and tools such as automation can help reduce time spent investigating, remediating, and eliminating threats or incidents.

#4: Time to detect
Next, they're measured on time to detect. SOC teams
should focus on ways to identify issues faster and ensure that they have tools in place to catch something they may have not even seen before (the dreaded zero-day
exploit).

#5: Number of incidents handled
Finally, the fifth key metric used to measure performance
is number of incidents handled, which teams can decrease by having better, faster, and more thorough alert and resolution tools in
place.

Part Three
What prevents  good work
Everyone wants to do their best work, especially highly-engaged security analysts. But as we saw in the past section, processes that
are both tedious and unenjoyable -- processes that could be streamlined and automated -- are taking up most or all of an analyst's time. What are some other challenges or barriers that
SOC teams encounter?
3 What prevents good work

Top five challenges analysts face

13.9%
#1: Being understaffed
The majority said their biggest challenge was being understaffed. We've seen this appear multiple times now in this report from our respondents: Too much work and not enough
people to do it.

10.5%
#2: Time spent on manual tasks
Their second biggest day-to-day challenge is time spent on manual tasks. Which, as we saw above, include tasks like reporting, monitoring,
and detection. Having this be a challenge specifically means that manual tasks are eating
away at their day at the expense of more impactful activities.

8.6%
#3: Poor visibility into the
environment
Another challenge is poor visibility into the environment or a lack of tools that allow them to see threats across networks and devices which
could put them on more proactive footing.

8.1%
#4: Poor processes
They also stated poor processes, which, as one of their day-to-day challenges, which can cause frustration, lack of engagement, and
burnout as well.

7.3%
#5: Too many alerts
Finally, too many alerts is their fifth challenge -- too many alerts in general, and too many false positives, which can cause alert fatigue and time taken from true threats and lead to everyone's worst nightmare: false negatives.

#1: Spending time on manual work
For our respondents, the most frustrating aspect of their day is spending time on manual work, like reporting, monitoring, and detection, as we saw
above.

33.8%

29.7%

#3: Too many different consoles

Another frustrating aspect of their job is having too many different consoles and tools to investigate incidents, which could lead to gaps in response
or inefficient processes.

#4: Inaccurate or incomplete attribution
They also stated that inaccurate or incomplete
attribution is another frustration they face, forcing them to take time and energy to seek out more context for
alerts.

#5: Slow or delayed log file ingestion and processing
Finally, they're frustrated with slow or delayed log file ingestion and processing creating lags on real time response.

Summary

3 What prevents good work

Part Four
Manual work  and automation
Lowering barriers to doing the best work, eliminating repetition, streamlining processes -- it's what security leaders are looking to
do for their teams. They can do so by building automation into their processes, like automating phishing attack responses, threat intelligence enrichment, or suspicious login alerts. But where do
SOC teams fall on their utilization of automation? Are teams embracing it, or still not sure if it's right for them?
4 Manual work and automation

64% are spending over  half their time on tedious manual work
How much time are analysts spending on tedious manual work? 12% say a quarter of their time is spent on tedious manual work while 23.9% say a quarter to half their time is spent that way. For 41% (the majority), half to three-quarters of their time is spent on tedious manual work, while 23.1% -- one in four analysts -- say three-quarters to all of their time is spent that way.

Why analysts should not
 fear automation
Fear of losing your job is a common response to the suggestion of automation. But "automation" doesn't mean "replacement," and automating tasks as a security analyst
can not only decrease tedious manual work to free up time for more high-impact projects, automation can become a learned skill to help SOC teams do their best work
and increase the value of the analyst. Why shouldn't analysts fear automation?
1
Because we need more people than ever
Security leaders know that the current recruitment market is unprecedented, and that there isn't nearly enough talent in the pipeline. As we've seen in the answers in this report, teams are understaffed, can't find people with the needed skills, and are frustrated with
spending their time on manual work. Even with the majority of L1 SOC analyst tasks automated, there's still "more work than ever," as seen from the above responses. Automation can help free up skilled workers for higher-level tasks, letting them play a
more valuable role in the organization.
4 Manual work and automation

2
Because we can learn from history
Automation brings with it a negative connotation because it often gets conflated with the idea that "robots are taking our jobs," and the threat of not being able to put food on the
table provokes an emotional human response. The truth is that automation has never acted to eliminate jobs in the long run. Instead, automation transforms and improves them. In security automation specifically, once analysts are given the superpower of automation, they start by replacing the mundane tasks they once had to do manually. Soon, however,
they go on to build entirely new processes in a creative manner.
3
Because automation is a tool for you to use
Automation, and specifically no-code automation, will become a core competency of security analysts. It's nothing to fear, as automation can make the job more creative, giving analysts not just the ability to build, maintain, and evolve ingenious automated workflows,
but also the ability to contribute more value to their organization, as well. Automated workflows aren't just a one-and-done build, either; analysts will need to modify, improve,
and update those workflows on an ongoing basis.
4 Manual work and automation

Top five tasks analysts would automate to save time

24.8%
#1: Risk assessments
The majority said the number one task they would automate is risk assessments. As we've
seen throughout this report, analysts are spending so much of their time and energy manually monitoring for and triaging risk, that if they could completely automate it, they would.

19.2%
#2: Intelligence analysis
Next, they would automate intelligence analysis so that alerts could arrive with richer, more actionable context, saving time on having to track down that information manually.

12%
#3: Threat hunting
The task they'd most like to automate next is threat hunting, allowing for the
elimination of manual efforts to search out hacker threats
or IOCs.

8.5%
#4: Email phishing response
They'd also like to automate email phishing response, which can eliminate the manual task of threat evaluation, communication
follow-up, and remediation.

8.3%
#5: Advanced triage
Finally, to save them time, they'd automate advanced triage, which is especially important considering that
the majority of our respondents are Level 2 or 3
analysts.

4 Manual work and automation

What would analysts do if their work was automated?

48.1%
#1: Updating operational documentation
The majority said that in the absence of manual work, they would focus on updating operational documentation. Having updated documentation is of course critical for the SOC team, but this indicates something else: That SOC teams are too busy to keep their documentation up-todate, and have fallen behind. The first focus after
automation would actually be catching up.

44.7%
#2: Developing advanced detection rules
The second highest ranked is developing advanced detection rules, which is a proactive way to improve their organization's security
posture, as well as a way to improve the performance metrics listed above.

41.0%
#3: Integrating more systems and
logs
If freed up, they would also focus on integrating more systems and logs, which is another proactive action that
can help improve the previously mentioned poor processes that are causing
frustration.

39.5%
#4: Research TTPs and focus more on
intelligence
Automating manual tasks would also allow them time and energy to research TTPs
and focus more on intelligence, increasing their offense on understanding and protecting against malicious
actors.

35%
#5: Reduce false positive rates
Finally, automation would allow them to modify
detection and alert rules to reduce false positive rates, reducing alert fatigue and burnout, and allowing them to focus on alerts that really
matter.

Improving retention
In considering the question of burnout from the previous section, the frustrations found in day-to-day manual operations, and the
awareness that the pandemic has challenged many to rethink their career trajectory, we wanted to know if analysts were
thinking of making job moves -- and what their organizations could do to retain them.

5 Improving retention

Voice of the SOC Analyst
Top three ways
 to improve retention
We asked our respondents about actions their organizations could take to improve their work, engagement, and likelihood of staying.
1
Provide tools that automate tedious manual tasks
The number one action analysts say organizations could take to improve retention is to provide tools that automate tedious manual tasks. By providing automation, especially no-code automation, analysts will be able to decrease their focus on
manual tasks and increase their focus on more proactive tasks, reducing burnout and increasing engagement.
2
Provide more modern tools with advanced capabilities
The second most favored action is for organizations to provide more modern tools with advanced capabilities. As we saw above, a frustration is having too many tools and consoles. By providing more best of breed tools with advanced capabilities like automation and better visibility, organizations are empowering their analysts to do
their best work, unencumbered.
3
Hire more people
Finally, analysts would consider staying if their organization simply hired more people to the team. As we've seen above, understaffing is a challenge, and fewer people
means higher workloads. Simply hiring more people would signal a commitment to the SOC and a recognition of its value, too, inherently increasing retention.

Actionable takeaways for security team leaders

As we've seen in this report, SOC teams are passionate yet challenged. They're satisfied and engaged with their work, yet endless manual tasks, understaffed teams, inefficient processes, and too many alerts are stifling their ability to do more high-quality, creative work. They're stuck doing repetitive tasks today,
unable to proactively work on preparing their organization's security posture for tomorrow.

What can SOC leaders do to improve their teams in 2022? Here are four ways forward.

1
Improving time spent  on reporting

2
Make triage  enjoyable

3
Increase retention by measuring and minimizing burnout

4
It's time for no-code automation

Actionable takeaways for security team leaders

Fortunately, there's a better, faster, and easier solution: no-code automation, which removes the barrier of coding so that
analysts can start building automated workflows today, without waiting on a development team. SOC teams that adopt this flexible, powerful form of workflow automation can reap the
benefits of automation immediately, giving security analysts the ability and freedom to do their best work.
