Proactively Address Cybercrime
The impact of cybercrime across nearly every aspect of the business is a reality that today's security and intelligence practitioners battle daily. Not only are we fighting sophisticated adversaries probing our networks, but we're now faced with a plethora of threats such as account takeover, constantly evolving malware, sophisticated intrusions, the scourge of ransomware, massive data leaks, third-party supplier and vendor compromises, a seemingly endless surplus of critical vulnerabilities being released to the wild and the list goes on. Reactive to the next incident is no longer an acceptable or effective approach.
Coverage and Ability to Operationalize
Intel 471's unparalleled global intelligence capability consists of automated collection systems and human intelligence teams that sit across 14 countries to provide near real-time coverage of threat actor and malware activity. Our Cybercrime Intelligence offers broad coverage across four core focus areas:
Adversary Intelligence: ongoing automated collection, human intelligence reporting, and high-fidelity alerting of top-tier cybercriminals targeting and affecting nearly every industry and geography across the globe.
Malware Intelligence: analysis and near real-time monitoring of malware activity and command & control infrastructure providing a steady stream of technical indicators, campaign reporting and deep technical insights on the top malware families deployed by threat actors.
Vulnerability Intelligence: regular vulnerability reporting and ongoing monitoring of the precursors of exploitation such as actor interest, exploit status, weaponization, productization and much more.
Credential Intelligence: ongoing monitoring and alerting of compromised credentials associated with your employees, VIPs, customers and third-party suppliers and vendors.
Benefits of Cybercrime Intelligence
Obtain ongoing and near real-time insight into the cybercriminal underground. Cybercrime Intelligence provides proactive and groundbreaking insights into the methodology of top-tier cybercriminals ­ target selection, assets and tools used, associates and other enablers that support them.
Intel 471's field driven collection and headquarters-based analysis is able to directly support the intelligence needs across an organization spanning your security, executive, vulnerability, risk, investigation and fraud teams.
Access finished intelligence or leverage the underlying and raw collection, it's up to you! We provide deliverables for multiple teams and maturity levels.
