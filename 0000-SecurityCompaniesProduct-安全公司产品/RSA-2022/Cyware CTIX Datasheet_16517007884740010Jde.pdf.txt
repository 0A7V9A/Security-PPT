Cyware Threat Intelligence eXchange (CTIX)

A Connected Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) for Feed Orchestration, Analysis, and Sharing

The inability to ingest, analyze, and operationalize threat intelligence has rendered organizations vulnerable to advanced security threats.
Organizations are lacking high-confidence, actionable threat intelligence, which holds the key to identifying, prioritizing, and containing threats targeting their networks and endpoints. The huge amount of threat data shared by internal and external sources ends up overwhelming security analysts severely impacting threat detection, investigations, and response activities. To overcome these challenges, many organizations are now moving towards automated, connected Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) that single-handedly solve the threat intel lifecycle management needs of security teams.
Cyware Threat Intelligence eXchange (CTIX) is a fully automated connected TIP that leverages AI and ML to automatically ingest, analyze, correlate and take action upon the threat data ingested from multiple external sources and internally deployed security tools in a format-agnostic manner. CTIX's unique capability to ingest, analyze, and action upon threat data collected from internally deployed security tools is complemented by its "Hub and Spoke" design architecture that enables security teams to build trusted sharing communities with their ISACs/ISAOs, CERTs, business units, clients, vendors, and regulatory bodies for exchange of specific, relevant and validated cyber threat intelligence.
Fully Integrated with Premium Feeds, Enrichments, and Security Technologies

Fully Automated Threat Intel Lifecycle Management

Multi-source Intel Collection
Ingest threat intel from external sources including TI providers, ISACs/ISAOs, CERTs, peers, etc., and internally deployed security stack including SIEM, UEBA, Firewall, etc. Automatically extract, normalize, and ingest threat indicators (IOCs) from structured (STIX, XML, JSON, CyBOX, etc.) and unstructured formats (emails, documents, web scrappers, RSS feeds, Twitter feeds, blogs, etc.)
Intel Dissemination and Actioning
Share actionable intel with internal security teams such as IR, SOC, VAPT, Threat Hunting, and external partners within your trusted sharing network for quick actioning and analysis Automate response workflows in your internal security stack such as blocking malicious IPs in Firewalls, updating SIEM data, etc.

Correlation, Enrichment, and Analysis
Automate enrichment, correlation, and analysis while performing IOC validation using the confidence scoring engine
Automate mundane actions using the Advanced Rules Engine and improve analysts' maturity and interoperability with automated conversion of STIX1.x (XML) to STIX 2.0 (JSON)
Governance, Collaboration, and Reporting
Create custom reports and threat views for SOC/IR/TI teams and governance stakeholders including CISOs, Head of SOC/TI/IR, etc.
View customized confidence scores, factor-based prioritization of cyber threats, and detailed statistical metrics within a compre·hens·ive threat dashboard
