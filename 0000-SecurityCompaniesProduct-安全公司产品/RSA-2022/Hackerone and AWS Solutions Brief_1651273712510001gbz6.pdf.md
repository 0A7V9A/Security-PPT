HackerOne and AWS
Hacker-Powered Security for Safer AWS Cloud Applications

Introduction
With so many of your applications running on AWS, it's more important than ever to enhance your cloud security strategy by using ethical hacker expertise to find and remediate vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Your organization needs to expand digital value by taking advantage of cloud agility without creating risks leading to cybercrime. But events such as application migration, product rollouts, or past breach remediations can introduce new vulnerabilities that invite exploits. Adding the security expertise of hackers to assess vulnerabilities in your cloud applications helps ensure the outcome you expect from your cloud transformation. HackerOne and AWS together accelerate the discovery of critical application vulnerabilities, streamline AWS security workflows, and strengthen your security teams to drive down organizational risk. By including a community of AWS Certified ethical hackers to find coding and deployment flaws, your teams can build and run their AWS applications with confidence, as shown in Figure 1 below.

HackerOne Assessments: Application Pentest for AWS
HackerOne provides a portfolio of security assessments to meet the needs of our customers, ranging from web, mobile, network, and APIs. HackerOne Assessments: Application Pentest for AWS is explicitly tailored for AWS-deployed applications. It helps security, cloud, and applications teams identify risks caused by cloud transformations, deployment changes, and previous breaches. Our pentests are designed and executed based on a methodology checklist to assure scope is covered, as shown below in Figure 2. After the pentest, a report is generated valid for compliance attestation or to keep stakeholders apprised of the results.

Key Use Cases
Compliance Assessment - Respond to an upcoming audit that includes AWS-hosted applications with a pentest that follows an AWS-specific methodology and identifies vulnerabilities that can cause increased cloud risk.
New Product Launch - Reduce the time spent on vulnerability testing of AWS cloud applications ahead of significant initiatives such as new product introductions.
Mergers & Acquisitions - Find hidden security issues that are introduced into your cloud environments, post-acquisition and assess the risk profile of newly acquired cloud applications.
Cloud Migration Testing - Track and protect against cloud application flaws as part of your cloud migration.
HackerOne Integration with AWS Security Hub
With workflow automation, this integration reduces the manual processes of comparing and taking action on vulnerability findings between HackerOne and AWS Security Hub, as seen in Figure 3 below. Use the integration to:
 Aggregate and prioritize vulnerabilities from HackerOne in Security Hub: Sync all HackerOne vulnerability findings and use AWS Security Hub as the single console to manage and prioritize those findings.
 Forward findings from Security Hub and other partners to HackerOne: Compare findings aggregated from AWS Partner Network (APN) in AWS Security Hub with those from HackerOne to eliminate duplicates, understand status, and plan security actions.

Supported Compliance Frameworks
SOC 2 Type II - SOC 2 compliance is the industry standard for technology service organizations. Customers will typically run annual pentests to maintain certification.
ISO 27001 - ISO 27001 helps organizations build out an Information Security Management System. Customers will generally get certified every three years.
FISMA - FISMA follows NIST 800-53, which we support. Pentesting is an annual requirement.
GDPR - GDPR is a data privacy framework that suggests "a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing." A pentest could meet this requirement, but there is no specified methodology or reporting output.
HITRUST - The HITRUST assessment methodology specifically requires assessors to gather and examine documentation. Customers would know which areas to include for the HITRUST certification, and therefore, for the pentest. The scope requirements should be agreed upon with the customer and the external assessor.
