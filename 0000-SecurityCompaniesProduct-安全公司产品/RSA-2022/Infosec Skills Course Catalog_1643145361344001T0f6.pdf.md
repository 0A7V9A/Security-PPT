Training mapped to the NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity
Infosec Skills connects employee job descriptions to an established workforce development framework. Your organization can take a bottoms-up approach to any training initiative by mapping development plans to specific NICE knowledge and skills, work roles or even the competencies deemed most critical to employee success.
How Infosec Skills content is mapped to the framework
Every Infosec Skills course, cyber range or project is audited and mapped to relevant NICE knowledge and skill statements. For example, some of the statements mapped to our "Common malware behavior" course include:
» K0259: Knowledge of malware analysis concepts and methodologies
» K0392: Knowledge of common computer/network infections (virus, Trojan, etc.) and methods of infection (ports, attachments, etc.)
» S0131: Skill in analyzing malware » S0087: Skill in deep analysis of captured malicious code (e.g.,
malware forensics)
