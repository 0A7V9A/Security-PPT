Portable media Cyber Security system
Enabling compliance and security for removable media
The Challenge: Portable Media
Usage of portable media (USB drives, CD/DVDs) present a critical risk, as using them bypasses IT security layers, and potentially introduces malicious les directly into the organization. Moreover, portable media can contain multiple threats, including compromised les, threats in hidden partitions and malicious hardware/ rmware. These inherent risks cause organizations to disallow their use, and led to the creation of compliance requirements such as NERC CIP-003-7 for critical infrastructures.
The Solution
GateScanner® Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) ensures security by treating every le as suspicious, performing deep threat scans, disarming the les, and creating a neutralized (harmless) trustworthy copy. GateScanner® CDR prevents advanced undetectable le-based attacks including Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Zero Days and ransomware while maintaining full le usability, visibility and functionality.
GateScanner® Kiosk
GateScanner® Kiosks serve as a gateway to prevent device and le-based threats from removable media, enforce policy on their usage, and enabling compliance. Users insert media at kiosks placed at central locations in a facility where les are scanned, disarmed and securely copied onto trusted media or into the organization's network. GateScanner® Kiosks can be deployed as stand-alone units or networked, installed at multiple locations and optionally coupled with a unidirectional data diode (GateScanner® Injector). The solution is centrally managed, with a robust reporting system to exhibit regulatory adherence.
