Secure Your Cloud from Source to Run
Security for containers, Kubernetes and cloud

Cloud apps need a new security stack
Modern cloud apps are built using CI/CD and run as containerized microservices. Traditional tools cannot keep up with cloud-native due to rapid application deployment cycles and dynamic container environments. Unless security is automated and embedded into the development lifecycle it slows down innovation. Securing the cloud requires a security stack built on open standards that automates security within the development lifecycle, from source to run.

Secure cloud, Kubernetes and containers
With the Sysdig platform, you can find and prioritize software vulnerabilities, detect and respond to threats and anomalies, and manage cloud configurations, permissions and compliance. You get a single view of risk from source to run with no blind spots, no guesswork, no black boxes. The company pioneered cloud-native runtime threat detection and response by creating Falco and open source Sysdig as open source standards and key building blocks of the Sysdig platform.

MANAGE VULNERABILITIES
Automate scanning within CI/CD pipelines and registries without images leaving your environment
See all vulnerabilities across containers and hosts
Better prioritize vulnerabilities based on runtime context

DETECT AND RESPOND TO RUNTIME THREATS

C O N T I N U O U S LY VALIDATE COMPLIANCE

Detect threats across containers, hosts and Kubernetes with Falco
Catch runtime drift and remediate at the source
Prevent lateral movement using Kubernetes network policies
Conduct incident response using detailed records

Save time with outofthebox policies and reports for PCI, NIST, SOC2, etc.
Automate compliance and governance via policy as code based on OPA
Implement File Integrity Monitoring across containers and hosts

MANAGE CLOUD C O N F I G U R AT I O N S AND PERMISSIONS
Identify misconfigurations and compliance violations
Enforce least privilege access for cloud identities
Detect cloud threats in real time by analyzing cloud logs without expensive exporting to SIEM

MONITOR KUBERNETES AND CLOUD
Prevent and resolve issues by monitoring performance and capacity
Accelerate troubleshooting using granular data
Simplify Prometheus monitoring by using our Managed Prometheus Service
