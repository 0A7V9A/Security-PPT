PROTECT YOUR CLOUD APPLICATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE Organizations continue to adopt cloud computing at a rapid pace to benefit from the promise of increased efficiency, better scalability and improved agility. While cloud service providers and applications continue to expand their own security services, it is ultimately your responsibility to secure your data within these cloud environments.

UNDERSTAND YOUR CLOUD SECURITY RISK
Cloud providers are responsible for the security of their platforms and applications. But configuring these platforms securely and identifying irregular behavior is up to the organizations and individuals using them ­ even if you're in the early stages of moving to the cloud.
In most cases, however, the people setting up accounts and using them are not security experts or specialists in cloud configuration. The result is an accelerating number of breaches that either expose sensitive enterprise data or enable the misuse of cloud accounts for personal financial gain.

PREVENT CLOUD DATA BREACHES
If your organization is using cloud infrastructure and applications, is your security keeping pace? Our Security Operations Center (SOC) team and security analysts understand cloud security models and use our ActiveEyeSM platform to monitor activity and configurations for new threats and attack vectors.
We can investigate and respond to cyber threats wherever they appear. Get visibility into all of this activity and interact with our team in real time via your ActiveEye account.

SOLUTION BRIEF CLOUD SECURITY SERVICES FOR ENTERPRISE IT

KEY FEATURES
CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY Modern IT environments require ongoing innovation and adoption of new technology. Cloud infrastructure enables organizations to get improved analytics, deliver new applications and better collaborate with partners, but it also introduces new security risks.
ActiveEye Cloud Infrastructure Security combines configuration best practices with advanced log analytics to provide visibility and control for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. You can rely on our security expertise to help you confidently protect your organization.
Our cloud infrastructure security solutions enable you to discover cloud resources and compare them against approved workload types, as well as assess current configurations of your cloud environments against industry best practices and internal requirements specific to your organization. The result is that organizations can get rapid, actionable insights to remove risks and resolve security gaps. Advanced analytics and machine learning enable ActiveEye to detect threats in real time and reduce false positives by more than 95 percent. By connecting via API with your existing security tools and workflows, you can gain even better visibility, faster.
CLOUD APPLICATION SECURITY Modern organizations are leveraging Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to power employee productivity, finance, human resources, customer relationship management functions and more. The SaaS approach enables organizations to rapidly adopt new capabilities faster and more cost-effectively than they could through on-premise deployment.
Unfortunately, with these benefits comes new risks. Applications beyond the traditional enterprise perimeter can unknowingly expose data outside the organization, allow access via compromised accounts and cut down on the visibility you need to identify insider threats from privileged accounts.
ActiveEye SaaS Application Security combines configuration best practices with advanced analytics to give you visibility and control into the tools you use every day to drive your business, including Office 365, Google G Suite, Okta, Box and others. ActiveEye for SaaS Application Security connects quickly to your applications via API and Integrates with ActiveEye Managed Security, your existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software or appliances, or even other Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) solutions.
