FIDO2, a Passwordless World

Passwordless
FIDO2 can be used as single factor authentication, 2nd factor authentication and multi-factor authentication. FIDO2 enables customers to do passwordless logon to their accounts including Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

High Security
FIDO2 is designed to replace weak accountpasswords mechanism with strong hardwarebased authentication using public key crypto to protect against phishing, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, and malware attacks. No secrets are shared between services.

Open Authentication Standard
Consists of W3C's Web Authentication Specification (WebAuthn) and FIDO's corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP).

Microsoft Believes Employees' Passwords Are a Problem

81% of breaches leverage stolen or weak passwords.
The average help desk labor cost for a single password reset is $70 (around 7,700 JP¥).
20% - 50% of all help desk calls are for password resets.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) protocols that require users to enter a known password or answer a knowledge-based question are risky and do not fully ensure the security of company data and accounts.
For enterprises with Microsoft accounts, including Azure Active Directory or Windows Hello for Business, biometrics are the key to unlocking a faster, highly reliable single sign-on (SSO) experience to access on-premises and cloudhosted resources.

The Reason Microsoft Uses FEITIAN Products

1. Enhance Security and Privacy
Online accounts, systems, and applications are vulnerable to attack and credential theft is at an all time high.
Employees reusing passwords increases the likelihood of phishing attacks, MTM attacks, and severe credential breaches. No business wants to risk a data breach given the steep financial consequences and toll on a brand's reputation.

By using FIDO2-certified fingerprint-enabled security keys or cards as part of multi-factor authentication process, only the correct user in possession of their biometric device can gain access to systems, leaving no chance for hackers to manipulate credentials.

2. Decrease IT Management Costs
Most IT help desk support calls are for password resets. And resetting an employee's password is more complex than a quick, one-click action.
IT department has more important tasks to perform, like ensuring business continuity and optimizing operations. By going passwordless, an organization no longer needs to expend support resources to manage employee credentials and assist with password resets.

Cut costs further by combining multiple functions on one security key or card, including authentication, identity verification, physical access, and payment processes.
FEITIAN passwordless security keys and smart cards are designed to meet FIDO and WebAuthn standards with Bluetooth for PC and mobile, as well as a variety of interfaces to fit Microsoft's needs.

3. Streamline Employee Productivity
Employee productivity suffers when the authentication experience requires timeconsuming, complex processes.
No one wants to memorize and keep track of new passwords. And tedious multi-factor authentication protocols, including traditional one-time password (OTP) methods, can often be anxiety - inducing and cause user friction.

Satisfy multi-factor authentication needs quickly by combining biometric security keys and cards with Azure AD MFA. With a simple touch, built-in sensors can verify employee's fingerprint and automatically unlock employee's device, allowing easy access to company resources from anywhere.

Google Demands for a Second Factor Device to Improve Privacy, Security, and Usability

Account takeovers have highlighted the challenge of securing user data online: accounts are often protected by no more than a weak password for the online service provider to distinguish legitimate users from account hijackers.
Researches have produced numerous proposals to move away from passwords, but in practice such efforts have largely been unsuccessful. Instead, many service providers augment password-based authentication with a second factor in the form of a one-time password (OTP). Unfortunately, OTPs as a second factor are still vulnerable to relatively common attacks such as phishing.

In addition, OTPs have a number of usability drawbacks. These factors limit the success and deployment of OTPs as a reliable and secure second factor.
Meanwhile, secure authentication factors, which use challenge/response-based cryptographic protocols, have their own barriers to deployment. National ID cards and smart cards require custom reader hardware and/or driver software to be installed prior to use. Depending on the implementation, these systems also make it challenging for users to protect their privacy.

The Reason Google Uses FEITIAN Products

Google turned to FEITIAN FIDO Secure Keys ­ multi-factor authentication devices that improve practicality in terms of privacy, security and usability.
The Security Keys were designed from the ground up to be practical: simple to implement and deploy, straightforward to use, privacy preserving, and protect against strong attacks. Google has supported Security Keys in its Chrome browser, deployed it within its internal sign-in system, and has enabled Security Keys as an available MFA in its web services.

After the deployment of FEITIAN FIDO Security Keys, Google has achieved both increased level of security and user satisfaction as well as reduced support cost.

The Reason Google Uses FEITIAN Products

"Security Keys are mandatory at Google, they provide superior protection against phishing not possible with many alternative two factor authentication solutions."
"FIDO Security Keys provide strong authentication that's resistant to many forms of advanced phishing attacks that traditional 2FA doesn't protect against, it also provides for a much better user experience."

The Bank Is Concerned About Its Customers' Account Safety

The development of the Internet has led to the development of the information industry, but also brought about increasingly serious information security problems, and identity authentication, as the first gate of information security protection, has assumed a vital role. However, at present, neither static passwords nor strong authentication methods can fully meet the authentication needs of users and enterprises.
Many banking applications are still using the authentication method of username/static password, and the security is completely dependent on the password. Static passwords are not only inconvenient to use but also not easy to remember, while users try to use common and easy-to-remember numbers such as birthdays and anniversaries as passwords, which are easy to be cracked and stolen and insecure.

To improve the security of application services, many stronger authentication methods are generated. Such as: One Time Password token, USB Key, SMS password, etc. Compared with the simple username/password authentication method, the security is improved. However, with the development of technology, these authentication methods also become more and more easy to be cracked.
