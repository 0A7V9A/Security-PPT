scoutINSPECT
PRECISION AT TACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT ACROSS ALL OF YOUR ENVIRONMENTS
According to Gartner, over 45% of IT spending will have shifted to cloud by 2024 (up from 33% in 2020). And with recent global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, more organizations are accelerating digital business transformation plans -- by at least five years -- to adapt to a world that involves higher adoption of remote work and digital touchpoints.
Traditional IT and security tools struggle to maintain visibility into these dynamic and complex environments. Understanding your external attack surface across your traditional IT and cloud environments will only become more critical as attackers look for any exposures to leverage.
With scoutINSPECT, you can gather external attack surface insights across all your digital environments to discover, analyze, and respond to exposures as they arise.
LOCK IN ON MOVING TARGETS
Attackers conducting reconnaissance have kept pace with modern technology stacks and operational issues. This means that attackers are harder to find ­ especially if they are outside your organization's perimeter. scoutINSPECT can give you an adversary's perspective of your internet inventory, including misconfigurations, exposed storage, vulnerabilities and forgotten assets ­ all issues that adversaries can easily find. By providing you with clearer targets for cybersecurity defenses, you can mitigate those risks before an attacker exploits them.
ACHIEVE FASTER TIME TO VALUE BY FOCUSING ON WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
Determining and managing your external attack surface can lead to unwieldy tools that provide you with irrelevant information. With scoutINSPECT, you get scalpel-like precision to gather and report on the assets and systems you care about ­ reducing noise, increasing your time to value, and lowering your total cost of ownership. Use the insights derived from scoutINSPECT to get the intelligence you need to identify, manage, and investigate cyber risks that are unique to your organization.
With scoutINSPECT, you can gather external attack surface insights across all of your digital environments.
