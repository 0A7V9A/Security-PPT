"It (the Cybersecurity Assessment ) was incredibly useful, done in a sympathetic way. Of course, it generated two years of work, but it got us to where we are--decent firewall, decent switches, decent integrations with endpoints--all those pieces. If we had not done that security assessment, I don't think we would have gotten to where we need to be."
- Alan Tottman Director of Information Management and Technology Nova Scotia Pension Services Corporation
