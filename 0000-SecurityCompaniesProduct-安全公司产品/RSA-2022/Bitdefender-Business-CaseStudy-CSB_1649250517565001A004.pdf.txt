Commerce State Bank protects growth
with advanced security
Wisconsin bank saves time on security administration, improves
patch compliance, and reduces endpoint licensing costs
Founded in 2005, Commerce State Bank provides a wide range of banking products and services to individuals and businesses. The company helps businesses drive revenue with commercial loans and individuals realize their dreams of home ownership, asset preservation, and wealth accumulation.

THE CHALLENGE
It was a close call. An employee at Commerce State Bank unknowingly clicked on a ransomwareinfected file. When the PC acted strangely, the employee wisely shut it down before the ransomware spread. While there was relief that disaster had been averted, IT recognized the existing Trend Micro security solution was no longer meeting the bank's needs. Aside from missing threats, Trend Micro proved difficult to manage and scale as the bank experienced strong growth.
IT evaluated solutions from McAfee, Kaspersky, Trend Micro, and Bitdefender. Initially, the bank chose Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security Premium but later upgraded to GravityZone Business Security Enterprise.
Peter Garancis, Vice President, Information Technology, Commerce State Bank, says, "We selected GravityZone because it was easy to manage and scale while offering advanced security and intelligence. We also liked that there was a smooth pathway to other GravityZone products that would provide us with enhanced security and cloud-based management as our bank grew."
THE SOLUTION
Today, Commerce State Bank protects Microsoft Windows workstations, Windows and Linux servers, and VMware virtual machines with Bitdefender GravityZone Business Security Enterprise which includes Sandbox Analyzer, an endpoint-integrated sandbox to analyze suspicious files, detonate payloads, and report malicious intent to administrators, and HyperDetect, a nextgeneration security layer that provides tunable machine learning with advanced heuristics and anti-exploit techniques.
The bank also uses GravityZone Full-Disk Encryption and Patch Management add-on modules.
Applications protected by GravityZone include Encompass360 mortgage management, ComplianceOne loan origination, FIS core banking, and Microsoft Office solutions, among others.

Industry Banking
Headquarters West Bend, Wisconsin, USA
Employees 80 (IT staff, 22)
Results - Stopped entry of
sophisticated malware and spyware
- Increased patch compliance from 70 to 95 percent
- Improved performance of user workstations
- Decreased endpoint licensing costs by 15-20 percent

"Deploying GravityZone was so simple that our college intern did most of the rollout with little guidance," reflects Garancis. "It gave me confidence that GravityZone was easy to manage and wouldn't require training."
THE RESULTS
Since installing GravityZone, Commerce State Bank has avoided malware or spyware outbreaks. Garancis says, "The layered security and incident response with GravityZone is powerful. Bitdefender automatically grabs malware or spyware and removes it. With Web filters and heuristics, GravityZone Hyper-Detect learns the behavior of malware on the fly rather than creating a rule or signature after the fact."
As a bank, compliance with state and federal regulations is a priority. Bitdefender easily generates the reports necessary to prove compliance.
With the GravityZone Patch Management add-on module, IT has increased patch compliance from 70 to 95 percent, explains Garancis. "We are so much better off with GravityZone Patch Management. Our success rate went way up, and we reduced time we spent on patch management by 50 percent."
Commerce State Bank expects that the GravityZone Full-Disk Encryption add-on module will reduce time associated with manually managing workstation encryption keys. Equally important is that Bitdefender storing the encryption keys will be more secure and provide better recoverability.
Garancis credits the well-designed, easy-to-use GravityZone cloud console with decreasing time spent on security administration. He says, "Because the GravityZone console is in the cloud, Bitdefender takes care of updating it, so everything is secure. We can access it from our main and DR sites or a remote location. It's one piece of the puzzle I don't have to worry about." Because GravityZone is centralized, Commerce State Bank reduced endpoint licensing costs by 15-20 percent.
GravityZone's lightweight footprint barely consumes infrastructure resources, unlike competitor products, which slow down performance during scanning. "GravityZone's performance has been stellar," remarks Garancis, "Even when we upgraded to enhanced GravityZone products, there wasn't any performance degradation. We heard from users that things ran much faster when we switched to GravityZone."
In addition to appreciating GravityZone's advanced endpoint security, the bank values the close partnership with Bitdefender. "Bitdefender is always willing to go the extra mile for us," Garancis reflects. "The customer support has been outstanding. The people at Bitdefender keep us informed of their roadmap and are fully invested in our success. Their commitment to us as a customer is another factor in keeping our bank secure and protected."
