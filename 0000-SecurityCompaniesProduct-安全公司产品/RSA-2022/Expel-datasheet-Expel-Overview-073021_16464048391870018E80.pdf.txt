Transparent managed security
24x7 managed detection and response
Transparent managed security is just what it sounds like. It breaks up the proprietary black-box approach that most managed security service providers (MSSPs) and managed detection and response (MDR) providers take. You see exactly what our analysts are doing for you 24x7. Our goal isn't just to check the box and meet the SLA. We want to measurably improve your security.

What we do
(it's more than what's in the SLA)
Expel monitors your environment 24x7 (on-prem and in the cloud) to find attackers and give you the answers you need to kick them out. We integrate with your security tech, cloud applications and cloud infrastructure to keep your crown jewels safe. The net result? You can focus on managing risk rather than massaging alerts.

What you get
(hint: it's not alerts)

We use your products to detect threats, filter out false positives and quickly engage you on the threats you need to care about.

24x7 threat detection Our analysts investigate threats and flag suspicious or risky activity. We'll tell you exactly what happened and when, how we detected it and what you need to do about it.
AI accelerated response Our response bot accelerates our analysts' response by automatically enriching alerts and performing routine level 1 and 2 tasks.

Actions for each incident We recommend specific, easy-tounderstand actions written in plain English so you can resolve each issue and reduce your risk.
Hunting Our analysts proactively hunt for malicious activity in your environment.
Managed phishing We'll investigate each reported email, tell you when they're real phishes and close the loop with your employees.

Performance metrics Dashboards measure your improvement over time, show where you're improving and let you hold us accountable.

Resilience recommendations
You get recommendations -- based on your environment and past trends -- so you can fix the root cause of recurring events or prevent them from happening in the first place.

How transparency changes our relationship
(for starters... you'll see what you're paying for)
Transparency means you share the same interface with our analysts so there's never any doubt about what we're doing on your behalf. It's a pretty radical idea in the security industry. But we couldn't imagine running a business any other way.

Watch investigations as they unfold You see exactly how our analysts are approaching each investigation including their rationale, methods and what they've discovered to date.
Take action even as the plan develops Don't wait until the investigation is over. You can take action as soon as we identify a critical remediation step.

See exactly how you're improving Detailed dashboards measure how well we're doing and quantify the improvement so you can draw a straight line from what you pay us to the value you get.
See and fix recurring problems Prioritize actions and investments using data from your own environment. Fix the root cause of recurring events or prevent them from happening in the first place.

What we replace
(in case you're wondering)
Expel replaces what customers spend on managed security service providers. In our view, MSSPs have reached the ceiling of the value they can provide. They've beaten their customers into submission and taught them to expect less by taking a transactional one-size-fits-all approach, managing to their SLA and prioritizing the quantity of alerts over quality of service. When it comes time to renew, their customers are left wondering what value they got.
