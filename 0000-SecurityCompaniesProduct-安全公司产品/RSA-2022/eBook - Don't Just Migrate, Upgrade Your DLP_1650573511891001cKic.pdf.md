THE RIGHT DLP DELIVERS THE DEEPEST VISIBILITY
An iceberg is 90% hidden under the surface of the water; like the data in your business, much of it is hidden. You need above and below the water level visibility. An effective, enterprise DLP can find, understand, and protect all your data, not just the visible.

WHERE DO I START WITH A DLP RE-EVALUATION?
LOOK INSIDE BEFORE LOOKING OUTSIDE. GATHER THE INSIGHTS WHERE YOU HAVE EASIER ACCESS TO THE PEOPLE AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO ASK HOW AND WHY DATA MOVES THE WAY IT DOES.
Visibility First = Metrics · Gather data to share with business units and stakeholders, data owners · Share with them the data they need to make informed policy decisions · Useful to track improvements and show ROI Provide risk-based policy recommendations · Not all data is the same · Leverage existing experience and best practices

DLP RE-EVALUATION ­ STEP 2
SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP WITH DLP VENDORS WITH THE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE:
Have use cases in mind to make it real Was there an incident that we don't want to see happen again? · Have people become too free using webmail or USB with sensitive data · Was there an employee departure flagged too late to stop printing of confidential information? · Was there malicious code or ransomware that is thought to have accessed sensitive data? If you're prepared to discuss a specific issue, you're likely to have a better experience than if you have overly generalized discussions

A PHASED APPROACH FOR DLP SUCCESS
Once you've gone through your internal review, external evaluation, and selection, the deployment process begins. Here is where you need to have a well documented plan. Digital Guardian has implemented DLP programs for hundreds of organizations, the one thing they have in common is a need to protect sensitive data without a drawn-out deployment.

· Once you have a DLP deployed you need to set policies to see anything, right? A DLP that can deploy in a policy free mode simply collects data on the events that happen in the course of the normal business processes. From this you can establish a baseline of what normal looks like, then build better polices (or establish a cybersecurity training program).
· You will gain tremendous into the business with the unbiased data collection: · Normal data flows throughout the business · Marketing accessing the legal and finance server at off hours · Sales reps encrypting, compressing, renaming excel files to look like .JPGs

· Finance accessing and downloading customer data at 3AM · User attempting to access multiple inactive · Applications spawning other applications and making
registry changes
· With a baseline established, look for anomalies or deviation from expected, investigate, and make an informed decision about the risk to the business.

But what about things you don't expect to see, like Powershell or developer tools by a member of the HR team?

· Even with the insights, baseline, and user education, there are still times that information security solutions like DLP need to take automated actions. Whether the user is ignoring the prompts, or an active and malicious user, security automation can stop data loss before it happens and give the security team the knowledge to further respond to the incident. The question is, what is the right level of action to take? That depends upon the risk profile of the business, but security teams need broad and flexible automation options.

· To best determine the actions, security teams should rank the actions using standardized terms, then assign a risk level to the results. From that list the team can then decide the level of automated response that balances information security benefits with business process interruption. An unauthorized access by and insider might be a moderate level event that requires a justification to proceed, while improper usage by an outsider may be critical and be blocked.

· Just as no business is static, no information security policy should be static. New target markets, new delivery options, and new risks all require a consistent review of the DLP program to ensure it still meets the intended data protection goals without impeding the business growth. Over the previous 6 months how easily can you show any changes to data egress? Are there new channels? Has a traditional data egress channel suddenly dropped? While that could mean people are moving less data (unlikely given the data explosion), it's more likely they've found a new method that the security team needs to understand and evaluate.

STEPS FOR SUCCESS ­ END-USER COMMUNICATION
No one likes surprises or being force fed a solution without any chance to comment. Any data security tool can alienate the users if they're not included throughout the entire process and this lack of communication causes workflow disruptions. While there are some occasions when a stealth mode install is needed, open communication is generally the recommended process with DLP.

CONFIGURE OUT OF THE BOX POLICIES
· Based on what you know and what the DLP solution provides out of the box, you can get your initial data protection policies in place.
· Set up the compliance policies that look for the easy to recognize data that follows a pattern ­ PCI, PHI, or PII.
· Establish your IP protection policies to recognize and protect the harder to protect unstructured and less predictable format common to IP.

When adding DLP to an organization without anything in place a soak period where you watch and learn how the data is moving leads to a more effective deployment. You can use data about the data to make policies that match your real world.

Policy Duplication

Visibility

In a displacement scenario policy duplication is where some businesses will begin. They are confident in the existing policies but need a better platform for their data protection. Once the new solution is in place, revisiting the data flows should be done to see where your team can make improvements.

USE DATA VISIBILITY INSIGHTS TO ENGAGE BUSINESS LEADERS

Anyone with DLP experience will tell you that DLP isn't just a security or IT initiative. Success depends on support and sponsorship from the business leaders. This is pure common sense. But we have a unique view on how to engage them.
The standard process is to sit down with the business leaders to define all data classification schemes and protection policies in advance. What do we recommend instead?
Start by sharing real discoveries from your "Quick Win" about where sensitive data resides and how it's being used. This will get the attention of your enterprise's business leaders. It will make it much easier for them to understand the risks to the business. And it will make it much easier to collaborate with them. That's exactly what John Graham, former CISO of Jabil did.

"Digital Guardian [Data Loss Prevention] helped us changed the conversation with business unit leaders."

CASE STUDY
JABIL'S QUICK WIN

SITUATION: Jabil is a Fortune 100 contract manufacturer. The company was at risk of large financial penalties if customer NDAs were violated due to a security incident.
SOLUTION: Within 30 days of DLP deployment, Jabil's security team gained visibility into all data access and usage across 52,000 workstations. They immediately realized that users copying large data files to USB drives was far more common than anyone expected. Digital Guardian's detailed egress reporting on the data leakage from USBs enabled Jabil's security team to have more productive conversations with business unit leaders. These exchanges focused not on defining what data was considered sensitive, but rather on how data from specific servers was being used (in this case copied to USBs) by users.
RESULTS: By providing business leaders real-world information on how data was being used (or misused), Jabil was able to identify and classify their most sensitive data faster and more efficiently. This was a dramatic improvement over a more traditional discovery and classification approach.

Within 30 days of DLP deployment, Jabil's security team gained visibility into all data access and usage across 52,000 workstations.

CASE STUDY
THE POWER OF REAL-TIME USER EDUCATION

SITUATION: The company is one of the largest managed healthcare providers in North America. Despite spending more than $1M annually on HIPAA compliance training, an internal audit identified a significant risk of non-compliance. The training had failed because it was a specific event not reinforced through ongoing processes. Users were not diligent about using the company's VPN, where data protection controls were enforced. Remote users routinely traveled with the sensitive data they needed to do their jobs.

# Prompts

Employees prompted

SOLUTION: The company's auditors recommended stricter controls, both on and off the corporate network. The company needed to change user behavior when interacting with sensitive data, reinforce existing policies as data was used, and create a culture that held users accountable for their actions. Digital Guardian helped by enforcing connections through the company's VPN, applying policies in real time based on network awareness, and prompting users who violated data use policies. Users are presented with a prompt screen that requires them to acknowledge the appropriate company policy and provide justification to continue.
RESULTS: Within six months, the healthcare provider reported an 85% decrease in prompts to users, indicating a significant increase in both policy awareness and secure employee behavior.
