Classify P2P traffic to support forensics and behavioral modeling of network traffic.

Writer and humorist Mokokoma Mokhonoana once said: "Time is a double-edged sword: while it might heal all wounds, it also kills all the healed."
Like time, anonymity and privacy technologies are at once a blessing and a curse. They can be used by the well-intentioned to safeguard people, data and systems, or by the unscrupulous to cloak cyber attacks.
Defending against such attacks would no doubt be easier if you had 100% visibility into every bit of traffic flowing across your network. But that isn't going to happen. Nor should it, as a rule. But that doesn't mean you have to fight cyber criminals, or steer network traffic, blindfolded.
Enea's Qosmos ixEngine® delivers vital intelligence about the encrypted traffic flowing across a network, while packet content remains private. You can use this data to:
1) Boost the ability of endpoint and perimeter defense systems to detect and respond appropriately to suspicious traffic.
2) Enrich analytics platforms dedicated to detecting and assessing advanced persistent threats that have used evasive techniques to bypass traditional defenses.
3) Enable intelligent, real-time traffic steering and policy enforcement in application-aware environments like SD-WAN and SASE.
And, thanks to Enea Qosmos ixEngine's First Packet Advantage feature, you can accurately classify applications from the first packet in a flow.
For maximum flexibility, the Enea Qosmos ixEngine is available as a Software Development Kit (SDK) in C for embedded use, and as a standalone application for use as a network sensor (the Qosmos Probe). In can also be deployed in physical or virtual environments on-premise or in the cloud.

Analytics for Traffic Classification and Anomaly Detection
Below are some of the types of embedded analytics performed to deliver deep, high-quality traffic intelligence. Many of these techniques are combined to produce the most accurate results. A select few are further paired with machine learning to safeguard visibility in environments in which there is a minimal amount of clear data in encrypted flows (for example, where TLS 1.3 and encrypted SSL handshakes are used).

Encrypted Traffic Classification Techniques for identifying applications and services and generating metadata for encrypted flows include:
Handshake Analysis Extraction of metadata in handshake messages that precede encrypted packets and which remain clear
Binary Pattern Analysis Detection & matching of binary patterns against known applications and services
Statistical Analysis Analysis of packet and flow characteristics using custom models developed by Qosmos R&D
Behavioral Analysis Analysis of encrypted session behavior versus characteristic protocol behaviors
DNS Cache Analysis with IPDB
Machine Learning Use of supervised & unsupervised learning to categorize traffic flows in fully encrypted environments

Detection of Suspicious Traffic
Techniques for identifying anomalous traffic (whether encrypted or not) include:
Session Correlation Regrouping and analysis of flows belonging to the same applications, clients & hosts to detect potentially evasive behavior
Public IP/Port-Based Classification Identifies anomalies in anticipated behavior for wellknown apps/services, FQDNs, ports and publicly routable IP subnets
Deep File Inspection Packet reassembly, file type detection (280+), MIME type and file extension consistency check, and file hash computation
Cryptocurrency Analysis Multi-layered analytics to detect and classify cryptocurrencies and mining pools (e.g., Ethereum, Monero, and Ripple)
Man-in-the-Middle Detection Combines multiple analytic techniques to produce a risk score for MITM attacks

About the Enea Qosmos ixEngine®
The Qosmos ixEngine is the most widely deployed commercial traffic classification engine in cybersecurity, networking and telecommunications. It features the broadest and most accurate protocol and application coverage in the industry. It can be used inline for real-time policy execution, or offline for monitoring and analytics.
Data Quality
The traffic data produced by the Qosmos ixEngine is unmatched for its depth, breadth and accuracy. Qosmos-generated data is:
Accurate It is based on the most trustworthy source available - telemetry data (not insecure log files), and rigorously validated. It is this reliability that enables Tier 1 vendors to use it with confidence in their planning, decision-making and operations.
Comprehensive It includes data on all network flows provided, and produces highly granular data for these flows. In total, the Qosmos ixEngine provides classification data for 3600+ protocols (including IoT/SCADA & Cloud/SaaS), and delivers 1000s of different types of packet, flow and security metadata.
Relevant It delivers precise, contextual data via a framework that offers maximum flexibility in selecting the data features most relevant to your analytical or operational needs.
Real-time It is generated from raw data captured on-the-fly via passive physical or virtual network TAPs that do not affect traffic flow.
Always Up to Date Updates are continuous and hot-swappable to ensure you will always stay abreast of constantly changing applications and protocols, and benefit from the latest advancements in data classification, especially for encrypted and evasive traffic.
