Uniquely, our platform integrates with SAST, DAST and SCA tools, bug bounty programs, issue trackers and code repositories to create highly-customized adaptive training programs. This ensures that developers are only taking the training they need to resolve existing knowledge weaknesses.
Our robust administrative tools make it easy for training administrators to get their developers to take, and complete, secure coding training to improve application security and compliance requirements. Your assigned customer success manager is your partner in ensuring a successful training program.
Our secure coding training helps customers meet PCI-DSS, SOCII, HIPAA/HITRUST, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001 compliance requirements.

HackEDU offers hundreds of lessons and challenges that engage and teach developers essential secure coding skills to prevent or fix vulnerabilities. Training content is newly released or refreshed each month to ensure developers are continually learning new skills.
