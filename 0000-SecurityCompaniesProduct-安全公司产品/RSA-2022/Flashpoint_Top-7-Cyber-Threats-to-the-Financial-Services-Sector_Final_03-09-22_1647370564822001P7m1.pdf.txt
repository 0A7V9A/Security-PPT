2022 REPORT
Top 7 Cyber Threats to the Financial Services Sector
Why Your Organization's Assets, Infrastructure, and Partners May Be At Risk

Primary Threats to Financial Organizations
Threat actors in search of large payouts targeted seemingly every type of business in the financial services sector in 2021. From retail, commercial, and internet-native banks to credit unions, credit card companies, investment brokerages, insurance firms, and mortgage lenders, security teams around the world had their work cut out for them.
In the following pages, we outline seven primary cyber threats facing the financial services industry in 2022, along with recommendations for identifying, mitigating, and preventing these attacks.

1

Ransomware. Threat actors continue to hold stolen data in exchange for hefty paydays, putting organizations in the

financial sector--along with their partners and customers--

at constant risk.

2

Third-party risks. A more concentrated third-party provider landscape--from cloud and payment services to virtual access networks and software--offers threat actors a smaller window but also wider potential for access.

3

Malware, e-skimmers, and formjacking. Threat actors are using malicious code to exploit various payment platforms and processes, including e-commerce forms where highly sensitive data is shared.

4

Compromised banking credentials. Threat actors constantly leverage stolen bank logs, putting pressure on financial organizations to be able to rapidly detect and protect against fraud.

5

Synthetic identities. By combining legitimate and fraudulent data, threat actors are testing financial organizations' ability to detect impersonators who can apply for credit under a false identity, among other types of fraud.

6

Decentralization and cryptocurrency. Threat actors transact in cryptocurrency due to its perceived anonymity via blockchain technology, which can obsuscate forensics. They also target crypto holders via social engineering scams.

7

Data breaches. Threat actors attempt to "hack" companies in the financial sector more than any other industry, except

for healthcare, according to our data collections.

1. Ransomware

Ransomware attacks can cost companies millions of dollars, as threat actors leverage highly sensitive data for a big payday. Ransomware attacks can put financial organizations at serious risk, along with the assets of their customers, employees, and partners.
In March 2021, CNA Corporation, a Chicago-based insurance company, paid a $40M ransom after threat actors gained access to the records of 75,000 people. In May, a highly publicized ransomware attack, Darkside gained access to Colonial Pipeline's networks, hindering the company's ability to deliver gas along its 5,500-mile pipeline, which supplied 45 percent of the US East Coast's fuel at the time. Ransomware is a cyber threat for which there is no end in sight, and they are sure to continue in 2022.
Ransomware advertisements were widely banned on major illicit community forums, beginning in May 2021. But that hasn't done much to slow down overall operations, as threat actors offering ransomware-as-a-service used terms like "crypters" or "lockers" to avoid their post or account getting immediately banned.

Governments around the world act
Some of the world's largest and most powerful governments are taking deliberate action against ransomware attacks.
In April 2021, then acting U.S. Deputy Attorney General John P. Carlin, released an internal memorandum announcing the formation of a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, and noted that he would seek additional support from the private sector.
In October, the Australian government released a Ransomware Action Plan. It deems ransomware as "one of the most damaging types of cyber attacks ... which can have severe and long lasting impacts on Australians and their businesses.
In its Annual Review, the National Cyber Security Centre--an arm of the UK's intelligence, security, and cyber agency--stated that ransomware had become the most significant threat facing the UK in 2021 and is "almost certain to grow."
PRO TIP
Leverage a threat intelligence partner with a robust, customizable alerting system to identify ransomware activity within illicit communities while engaging with experts on a threat response and readiness plan. Also, be aware of leaked credentials as soon as they occur to prevent breaches from occurring, as these can lead to malware attacks.

2. Third-party risks
Financial institutions must be aware of supply chain risks that stem from third-party vendors and partners, such as cloud service providers, managed service providers, and other outsourced operational tasks. Breaches or cyberattacks of vendors along the software supply chain could significantly affect business operations, compromise sensitive customer data, and also erode customer trust and brand reputation.
Cloud risks It's likely that financial institutions will increasingly adopt more cloudbased technology, like open banking, virtual workspaces, and data sharing applications. The cloud threat landscape is most commonly plagued with well-known misconfigurations, which threat actors can exploit to gain a foothold in the network environments, exfiltrate data, and sell it within illicit communities. They commonly advertise access to VPN and RDP resources, likely via compromised credentials.
PRO TIP
Financially motivated employees of third-party vendors may advertise their privileged access to a financial institution's data by claiming to be an "insider." These types of advertisements are most commonly observed within financial fraud-related Telegram channels, and generally mention the name of the financial institution. Organizations across the financial sector should actively track, collect, and search data from a wide range of illicit communities, including chat services, so they can better understand the threat actor landscape.

Software supply chain attacks, such as SolarWinds, have posed specific threats to financial institutions.
The Log4Shell vulnerability, for example, enabled threat actors to spread banking malware like Dridex, which delivers spam campaigns to infect computers and steal banking credentials and other personal information. Generally, this malware is deployed to facilitate fraudulent money transfers.

3. Malware, e-skimmers, and formjacking
A digital form of skimmers--small, physical devices that threat actors insert affix to ATMs to swipe payment card data and PIN codes-- e-skimming is a major cybersecurity concern for financial institutions and their vendors. E-skimmers are lines of malicious code that a threat actor injects into a website, which steals information from HTML fields, including credit card data and other credentials. E-skimmers drive customers to domains controlled by a fraudster that look, feel, and function like a legitimate checkout page.
Threat actors frequently utilize e-skimming--a.k.a. digital skimming, web skimming, online skimming, formjacking malware, or a magecart attack--to steal data during a purchase. Therefore, e-skimmers are a threat not only to financial institutions themselves but also their retail partners or any other entity that processes payment information on their behalf, such as an entertainment or travel company.
PRO TIP
Having access to a searchable threat intelligence database where one could search for commonly used terminology that is indicative of stolen or compromised payment card offerings is a good place to start. That way, card issuers can set up automatic alerts whenever they are being mentioned within illicit communities.

4. Compromised banking credentials
Stolen bank logs most frequently appear within Flashpoint's marketplace, forum, and chat services collections. Within illicit marketplaces, threat actors advertise credential offerings that have commonly been harvested using stealer malware and packaged as part of a larger output of collected log data. More commonly on forums, (though present in other collections), threat actors will advertise "self-registered" bank accounts that were likely created via some form of synthetic identity fraud (more on this in the next section). Chat service bank logs more commonly are advertised individually and can be collected using account takeover (ATO) or phishing methods, although threat actors generally do not publicly share how they came to possess these bank logs.
Cashing out In addition to selling these bank logs, threat actors can use the logs for themselves by transferring the funds electronically to other bank accounts, purchasing gift cards, or making fraudulent purchases. If the transactions are disputed by the victim, the financial onus often falls on the card issuer.
PRO TIP
Financial institutions should leverage optical character recognition (OCR) in their threat detection programs. Why? Because threat actors operating on illicit communities, forums, and marketplaces will often post screenshots of the account balances they have access to as proof of concept. Having the right technology can make the search for your organization's name or logo much easier and faster.

5. Synthetic identities
Synthetic identity fraud (SIF) is a method whereby threat actors create accounts or profiles by pairing legitimate information with false information. For financial institutions, this is a major threat, as lines of credit can then be built and maintained based on these profiles. Threat actors also commonly leverage SIF to create new bank or payment platform accounts and to establish lines of credit. Once threat actors apply for credit--and possibly get denied--they are able to store an address on file, which can later help to validate that synthetic identity with credit bureaus.
Synthetic identity fraud is typically carried out, at least initially, by applying for credit cards, paying bills on those cards, opening bank accounts, and proceeding to move money into and out of bank accounts with regular payments. Synthetic identities can also be used to transfer funds within the ACH network. They can act as recipient accounts for transactions of compromised funds from electronic payment systems with stolen credit cards linked to them.
PRO TIP
Guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) have previously been issued by the White House in 2021 and by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020 and 2021. In the Fall of 2021, the FTC filed an advance for rules that would amend the FTC Act in order to implement stricter privacy and security practices surrounding AI, although specifics of this proposed rule have yet to be shared. To combat emerging and existing cyber threats to financial services institutions, Flashpoint analysts recommend taking future compliance requirements and breach investigations into consideration when crafting cybersecurity policies and keeping updated on growing trends among threat actors.

Where threat actors get their data
Fullz
Threat actors can obtain the legitimate information that's used to create synthetic identities from a variety of databases on the dark web and surface web. While it is generally discouraged in illicit communities to leverage the entirety of a set of "fullz" data, threat actors may extract specific information, like social security numbers (SSNs) within that fullz, as the foundation of their synthetic identity. This personally identifiable information can be found in SSN / DOB shops, breached data forum offerings, and chat service channels.
Biometrics
The financial services industry is increasingly adopting biometric authentication for online payment systems and know-your-customer (KYC) systems. However, both bear significant risk for customers and financial services providers alike. Retailers and payment processors have experimented with payment authorization systems, including facial recognition and fingerprint-authorized contactless payments. However, synthetic "deepfakes" (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake") can enable threat actors to falsify biometric data, and AI-powered techniques like deepfake voice phishing are cited as a threat vector of major financial fraud operations.

6. Decentralization and cryptocurrency
Threat actors leverage the anonymity provided by decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrencies (cryptos) to conduct illegal activity. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero are three of the most popular cryptos that threat actors use. All three of them utilize blockchain technology, which is public and open source and distributes the trust of the financial network across all participants. The only identifiers stored in the blockchain are the addresses for a participant's private wallet, which can be created without any personally identifiable information (PII).
Two sides of the privacy coin Although anonymity is a perceived benefit of these cryptos, both Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions can be easily traced through their blockchain ledger when other operational security practices such as crypto mixers are not used. Monero, the preferred crypto for privacy minded threat actors, is a privacy coin, which utilizes anti-forensic methodologies to obfuscate all transactions on its blockchain, making it difficult to follow transactions on its blockchain.
Social Engineering There are many types of scams that affect crypto holders, but the most common are related to romance, investments, initial coin offerings, fake exchanges, mobile apps, giveaways, extortion, and QR codes. Crypto scams fall into two categories, both of which are most commonly executed via social engineering.

Types of Crypto Scams
1. Compromising a victim's wallet
This scam allows threat actors to transfer all the funds from the wallet to other wallets quickly; it is almost impossible for the victim to recover their funds.
2. Tricking a victim into transferring funds to a threat actor's wallet
Convincing a victim to transfer funds to a designated wallet controlled by a threat actor is profitable, but less so than a complete takeover of a wallet.
PRO TIP
Flashpoint foresees additional US sanctions targeting threat actor crypto wallets and exchanges involved in facilitating illicit ransom payments. To avoid non-compliance, keep tabs on the US Treasury Department's advisories and guidance issued on these topics, as well as new regulations on crypto in general.
Did you know... In 2021, Flashpoint identified 10 crypto attacks that yielded threat actors greater than $77M in cryptos each. These exploits included access to private keys to hot wallets, injection of malicious scripts, errors in cryptocurrency price computations, access to administrator keys, and vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

7. Data breaches
Research from Risk Based Security (RBS), a Flashpoint company, shows that financial institutions represent one of the most targeted sectors, second only to Healthcare. In our 2021 Year End Data Breach QuickView Report, we reported 4,145 publicly disclosed data breaches that, in total, exposed over 22 billion records last year alone. Of those, the financial and insurance sectors experienced the second-highest number of breach events, and were responsible for the loss of 16 billion records.
Looking further into the data, Flashpoint and Risk Based Security observed that over 63 percent of breaches occurring within the financial services sector originate from "hacking," or unauthorized access to systems or services. Whether or not these incidents stem from outside or inside the organization, the type of data that is being targeted remains consistent. Threat actors, including insiders, typically target names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), as well as other financial data, including bank account numbers and transaction details, with the purpose of using them in phishing attacks, committing fraud, or selling them on illicit forums and marketplaces.

PRO TIP
To help prevent data breaches, financial organizations should establish proper security controls and remediate vulnerabilities affecting deployed assets that house sensitive data. Enterprises should also ensure that key vendors in their digital supply chain are doing the same.
Focusing on resiliency and having a well-developed incident response plan is just as important to reduce the negative impact of a breach. Business leaders should study breaches that have happened in their industry. By understanding what took place and which types of information was exposed, financial organizations can gain insight into how an event could impact them.
