Executive Summary
CyberVista's Cyber Insights Reports provide clients with discrete analytical insights related to the knowledge and skill areas of teams. Cyber Insights Reports draw out specific conclusions based on the results of a diagnostic and/or a training implementation (i.e., a course or other training initiative). We do this by analyzing a variety of data points including initial diagnostic scores, demographic data, course engagement (when applicable), and final assessment performance (when applicable). Using these data points ­ in addition to CyberVista's industry knowledge about the Cyber/IT workforce writ large ­ CyberVista illustrates skill/knowledge improvements as well as provides additional analytic findings related to the cohort itself. Participants in this _____ cohort were enrolled in CyberVista's NICE Workforce Diagnostic. The NICE Workforce Diagnostic provides cybersecurity leaders and practitioners with visibility into cybersecurity competencies across all seven categories of the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. Those categories are: Analyze, Collect & Operate, Investigate, Operate & Maintain, Oversee & Govern, Protect & Defend, and Securely Provision.

Key observations and recommendations: Collectively, the _____ cohort exhibited the greatest proficiency in Oversee & Govern (65% proficiency) and Collect & Operate (54% proficiency). As groups of participant scoring were analyzed by the NICE job role for which they are aligned, CyberVista was able to identify potential training opportunities for those groups to increase any identified knowledge/skills gaps. Performance scoring can always be positively or negatively skewed by an individual's results (outliers), therefore CyberVista always encourages our clients to also evaluate performance at the individual level when considering training implementations or opportunities. Key takeaways from our analysis of the job role groupings include:

Knowledge/Skills Analysis
The Participants: The participants in this NICE Workforce Diagnostic consisted of a diverse group of 46 U.S-based _____ employees. The cohort included cybersecurity related professionals that represented a diverse set of cybersecurity job roles (11 roles, in fact); there was one participant of the diagnostic who does not currently hold a cyber-related role (categorized as "N/A" in the job role breakout). Overall, the results from the _____ cohort reflects a diverse set of knowledge/skills across the seven NICE categories for which they were assessed, which is to be expected given the diversity of the roles represented by the participants.

Overall Cohort Competency Profile
Collectively, the _____ cohort exhibited the greatest proficiency in Oversee & Govern (65% proficiency) and Collect & Operate (54% proficiency). When analyzing a cohort where the participants represent a number of different job roles, collective scoring and averages become less meaningful when looking at potential recommendations of improvement for teams, roles, or individuals; that said, the data can be useful as a general overview of the general proficiency of the larger workforce being analyzed. In other words, given the number of job roles represented by the participants, the data helps to answer the question "is there adequate coverage [or proficiency] across the NICE categories of skills." With more roles represented, the data would typically show well-roundedness of proficiency across the seven NICE categories. In this case with these _____ participants, the data does exhibit rounded representation of skill areas.
To dive into greater granularity of skills across these seven categories of the NICE framework, our diagnostic measures proficiencies at the specialty area. The CyberVista Workforce Diagnostic effectively measures against 20 of the 33 NICE specialty areas. Analyzing the performance outcomes at the specialty area allows us to evaluate whether proficiency is exhibited in the right area(s) for participants' indicated job roles. Typically with each job role there are one to five specialty areas of relevance; that is where we pay most of our attention when analyzing performance results. Figure 2 illustrates the collective results of the _____ cohort at the specialty level. This view allows us to identify areas of knowledge and skill proficiency and deficiency when we analyze the participants grouped by their designated job roles.

Performance Analysis by Job Role SYSTEM SECURITY ANALYST (OM-ANA-001)
NICE describes the role of a System Security Analyst as: "Responsible for the analysis and development of the integration, testing, operations, and maintenance of systems security." Of the _____ participants, 22% (n=10) represented the System Security Analyst job role, which nests underneath the `Operate & Maintain' category and the `Systems Analysis' specialty area. Given the expected knowledge and skills for this job role, proficiency expectations are expected under the `Systems Analysis' specialty area, as well as other periphery specialty areas such as `System Administration,' and `Network Services,' `Targets,' and `Threat Analysis' given some overlap in knowledge and skill areas shared between roles within those specialty areas. Observations & Recommendations While the Systems Security Analysts did well in `Targets,' there is opportunity for skill development for this team. Consider:
1. CyberVista's Critical Knowledge Course, or a configured version of it (Threats & Attacks, Network Security, Security Engineering, and Offensive & Defensive Schema Units)
2. CyberVista's Cloud Security Essentials course
3. Security+ Certification

CYBER DEFENSE ANALYST (PR-CDA-001)
NICE describes the role of a Cyber Defense Analyst as: "Uses data collected from a variety of cyber defense tools (e.g., IDS alerts, firewalls, network traffic logs) to analyze events that occur within their environments for the purposes of mitigating threats." Of the _____ participants, 17% (n=8) represented the Cyber Defense Analyst job role, which nests underneath the `Protect & Defend' category and the `Cyber Defense Analysis' specialty area. Given the expected knowledge and skills for this job role, proficiency expectations are expected under the `Cyber Defense Analysis' specialty area, as well as other periphery specialty areas such as `Incident Response,' `Targets,' `Threat Analysis,' and `Network Services' given some overlap in knowledge and skill areas shared between roles within those specialty areas. Observations & Recommendations Collectively, the Cyber Defense Analysts scored well overall, however the scoring illustrates proficiency in the periphery specialty areas while highlighting potential improvement in the primary area of `Cyber Defense Analysis.' Consider:
1. CyberVista's SOC Analyst Course 2. Evaluate needs of employees at the
individual level as some may benefit from additional training opportunities such as CyberVista's Incident Response Course or even CyberVista's Critical Knowledge Course, or a configured version thereof (Threats & Attacks, Security Operations, and Offensive & Defensive Schema Units)
