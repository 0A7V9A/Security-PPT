CRITICALSTART Security Event Response IR Retainer
Extend Your Team, Not Your Dwell Time.

When your organization is under cyberattack, immediate response is critical. The longer the dwell time, the more damage the attack can inflict. Unfortunately, too many companies don't know what to do or where to turn when a breach occurs. You need experienced professionals to help protect your critical data.
Our Incident Response (IR) team is comprised of professionals with experience conducting cyber investigations and incident response for federal law enforcement, the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and the private sector.
This team can provide your organization IR services from detection through remediation. Our IR retainers offer several options of service hours, and any unused hours may be applied to other services, such as penetration testing.
