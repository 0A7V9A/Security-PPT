Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
RADICATI MARKET QUADRANTS EXPLAINED
Radicati Market Quadrants are designed to illustrate how individual vendors fit within specific technology markets at any given point in time. All Radicati Market Quadrants are composed of four sections, as shown in the example quadrant (Figure 1).
· Top Players ­ These are the current market leaders with products that offer, both breadth and depth of functionality, as well as possess a solid vision for the future. Top Players shape the market with their technology and strategic vision. Vendors don't become Top Players overnight. Most of the companies in this quadrant were first Specialists or Trail Blazers (some were both). As companies reach this stage, they must fight complacency and continue to innovate.
· Trail Blazers ­ These vendors offer advanced, best of breed technology, in some areas of their solutions, but don't necessarily have all the features and functionality that would position them as Top Players. Trail Blazers, however, have the potential for "disrupting" the market with new technology or new delivery models. In time, these vendors are most likely to grow into Top Players.
· Specialists ­ This group is made up of two types of companies:
a. Emerging players that are new to the industry and still have to develop some aspects of their solutions. These companies are still developing their strategy and technology.
b. Established vendors that offer very good solutions for their customer base, and have a loyal customer base that is totally satisfied with the functionality they are deploying.
· Mature Players ­ These vendors are large, established vendors that may offer strong features and functionality, but have slowed down innovation and are no longer considered "movers and shakers" in this market as they once were.
a. In some cases, this is by design. If a vendor has made a strategic decision to move in a new direction, they may choose to slow development on existing products.

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021

b. In other cases, a vendor may simply have become complacent and be out-developed by hungrier, more innovative Trail Blazers or Top Players.
c. Companies in this stage will either find new life, reviving their R&D efforts and move back into the Top Players segment, or else they slowly fade away as legacy technology.

Figure 1, below, shows a sample Radicati Market Quadrant. As a vendor continues to develop its product solutions adding features and functionality, it will move vertically along the "y" functionality axis.

The horizontal "x" strategic vision axis reflects a vendor's understanding of the market and their strategic direction plans. It is common for vendors to move in the quadrant, as their products evolve and market needs change.

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
MARKET SEGMENTATION ­ DATA LOSS PREVENTION
This edition of Radicati Market QuadrantsSM covers the "Data Loss Prevention" (DLP) market, which is defined as follows:
· Data Loss Prevention solutions ­ are appliances, software, cloud services, and hybrid solutions that provide electronic data supervision and management to help organizations prevent non-compliant information sharing. These solutions serve to protect data at rest, data in use, and data in motion. Furthermore, these solutions are "content-aware" which means they can understand the content that is being protected to a much higher degree than simple keywords. Leading vendors in this segment include: Clearswift, CoSoSys, Digital Guardian, Falcongaze, Fidelis Cybersecurity, Forcepoint, McAfee, Safetica, SearchInform, Symantec, and Zecurion.
· We distinguish between three types of DLP solutions:
o Full DLP solutions ­ protect data in use, data at rest, and data in motion and are "aware" of content that is being protected. A full-featured content-aware DLP solution looks beyond keyword matching and incorporates metadata, role of the employee in the organization, ownership of the data, and other information to determine the sensitivity of the content. Organizations can define policies to block, quarantine, warn, encrypt, and perform other actions that maintain the integrity and security of data.
o Channel DLP solutions ­ typically enforce policies on one specific type of data, usually data in motion, over a particular channel (e.g. email). Some Channel DLP solutions are content-aware, but most typically rely only on keyword blocking.
o DLP-Lite solutions ­ are add-ons to other enterprise solutions (e.g. information archiving) and may or may not be content-aware. DLP-Lite solutions will typically only monitor data at rest, or data in use.
· This Market Quadrant deals only with Full DLP solutions, as defined above. Channel DLP and DLP-Lite solutions are not included in this report as they are usually purchased as a component of a broader security or data retention solution (e.g. Compliance and Data

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
Governance).
· External threats to data exists in a myriad of forms through advanced persistent threats (APT), espionage, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to data. While external threats are a problem, data loss from internal threats is also a significant concern. Internal data loss can be malicious, such as a disgruntled worker copying sensitive data to a flash drive, or it can be the result of negligence due to an honest mistake, such as an employee sending a customer list to a business partner that shouldn't have access to it.
· Increased worldwide regulations also support growing adoption of DLP solutions. Laws that mandate the disclosure of data breaches of customer data, compliance with government and industry regulations, as well as recent regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU-US Privacy Shield affect organizations of all sizes, across all verticals.
· Organizations of all sizes continue to invest heavily in DLP solutions to protect data and ensure compliance. The worldwide revenue for DLP solutions is expected to grow from nearly $1.5 billion in 2021, to nearly $3.5 billion by 2025.

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
EVALUATION CRITERIA
Vendors are positioned in the quadrant according to two criteria: Functionality and Strategic Vision.
Functionality is assessed based on the breadth and depth of features of each vendor's solution. All features and functionality do not necessarily have to be the vendor's own original technology, but they should be integrated and available for deployment when the solution is purchased.
Strategic Vision refers to the vendor's strategic direction, which comprises: a thorough understanding of customer needs, ability to deliver through attractive pricing and channel models, solid customer support, and strong on-going innovation.
Vendors in the Data Loss Prevention space are evaluated according to the following key features and capabilities:
· Deployment Options ­ availability of the solution in different form factors, such as onpremises, appliance and/or virtual appliance, cloud-based services, or hybrid.
· Platform Support ­ the range of computing platforms supported, e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and others.
· Data in use ­ the ability to assign management rights (manually or automatically) to files and data that specify what can and cannot be done with them (e.g. read-only, print controls, copy/paste controls, etc.). In addition, the ability to specify which devices and protocols (e.g. Bluetooth) can be used when accessing sensitive data. For devices, DLP solutions should be able to specify the type and brand of authorized devices that can interact with sensitive data.
· Data in motion ­ web controls and content inspection that prevent the sending of sensitive data through the web, email, social networks, blogs, and other communication channels. Integration with secure web gateways and email gateways is an important aspect of this function.

Copyright © November 2021, The Radicati Group, Inc. Licensed for distribution.

7

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
· Data at rest ­ refers to data store scanning, fingerprint scanning and the ability to monitor all stored data at regular intervals in accordance with established corporate data policies.
· Policy templates ­ built-in and easily customizable policy templates to help adhere to industry regulations (e.g. HIPAA, PCI, and others) and best practices.
· Directory Integration ­ integration with Active Directory, LDAP, etc. to help manage and enforce user policies.
· Enforcement visibility ­ employee alerts and self-remediation capabilities, such as confirmations and justifications of data policy breaches.
· Mobile DLP ­ monitoring of data on mobile devices fully integrated with organization-wide DLP controls. Integration with Mobile Device Management (MDM) / Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) capabilities, or partnerships with leading MDM/EMM vendors.
· Centralized Management ­ easy, single pane of glass management across all deployment form factors, i.e. cloud, on-premises, hybrid, etc.
· Encryption ­ vendor-provided embedded encryption capabilities or through add-ons.
· Drip DLP ­ features to control the slow leaking of information by monitoring multiple transfer instances of sensitive data.
· Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) integration ­ either through the vendor's own CASB capabilities or through partners.
In addition, for all vendors we consider the following aspects:
· Pricing ­ what is the pricing model for their solution, is it easy to understand and allows customers to budget properly for the solution, as well as is it in line with the level of functionality being offered, and does it represent a "good value".
· Customer Support ­ is customer support adequate and in line with customer needs and response requirements.

8

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
· Professional Services ­ does the vendor provide the right level of professional services for planning, design and deployment, either through their own internal teams, or through partners.
Note: On occasion, we may place a vendor in the Top Player or Trail Blazer category even if they are missing one or more features listed above, if we feel that some other aspect(s) of their solution is particularly unique and innovative.

Data Loss Prevention - Market Quadrant 2021
WEAKNESSES
 Symantec solutions can be somewhat more expensive than other DLP solutions on the market. However, the new packages deliver rich feature sets which when fully integrated with other Symantec security solutions provide significant protection benefits and operational cost efficiencies.
 While Symantec offers a broad portfolio of data security solutions, it can be somewhat complex to manage for organizations with fewer resources. Smaller companies, however, can rely on managed services offered through Symantec partners.
 While Symantec continues to innovate in this space and has strong brand recognition, it is perceived to be more focused on the needs of enterprise customers than those of small to mid-market customers.
 Symantec lost some mindshare following the Broadcom acquisition. The vendor has implemented a number of changes to address this.

· Fidelis offers a good set of out-of-the-box policies and rules for securing sensitive information. It has added OCR support to its email DLP capabilities.
· Fidelis offers DLP as part of a broader solution for network, endpoint, and deception post breach threat detection and response, which will appeal to organizations that want to deploy an integrated solution for compromise intelligence, detection and response automation.
WEAKNESSES
· Fidelis does not offer DLP for data-at-rest, or data-in-use, focusing instead on DLP for data in motion, and bringing that together with its broader threat automation detection and response capabilities.
· Fidelis does not integrate with mobile security solutions and does not offer endpoint DLP.
· Fidelis does not offer visibility into encrypted traffic.
· Fidelis has lost visibility in the DLP space, choosing instead to focus on automated threat detection and response.

McAfee Enterprise offers security solutions, threat intelligence and services that protect business endpoints, networks, servers, the Cloud and more. In July 2021, McAfee Enterprise was acquired by a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group (STG). In September 2021, STG also announced the acquisition of FireEye products and its intent to combine McAfee Enterprise and FireEye products into a new pure play cybersecurity company.
SOLUTIONS
McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention (DLP) offers a number of DLP components for endpoint, network, and cloud that can be mixed and matched to create a complete DLP solution. It is a key component in McAfee's MVISION Unified Cloud Edge (UCE) vision, a device to cloud strategy that converges CASB, DLP and Web technologies to help organizations apply consistent data security and threat protection policies across their entire environment. McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention includes the following components:
· McAfee DLP Discover ­ identifies and protects data at rest for both network storage and endpoint storage. The solution indexes content at rest within the network, including databases, Microsoft SharePoint and endpoints and allows administrators to see how this data is used, who owns it, where it is stored, and other details. McAfee DLP Discover also offers Exact Data Matching for structured data, such as sensitive data stored in an excel sheet in the database. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality is included to recognize and protect text in scanned images and forms.
· McAfee DLP Prevent ­ encrypts, redirects, quarantines, or blocks sensitive data being transferred via email, IM (instant messaging), HTTP/HTTPS, FTP transfers, and other methods. DLP Prevent scans inbound and outbound network traffic across all ports, multiple

protocols, and various content types. McAfee DLP Prevent for Mobile Email provides content-aware protection to mobile email by intercepting emails downloaded to the mobile device, via ActiveSync proxy with DLP capability, requiring no agent to be installed. The Capture technology is also available, and can act as a digital recorder to replay DLP incidents after the fact for more thorough investigation. DLP Prevent also offers Exact Data Matching for structured data, such as sensitive data stored in an excel sheet in the database. It includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
· McAfee DLP Monitor ­ identifies, tracks, and reports on data-in-motion in an organization. The solution monitors all outbound network data. The information stored in the Capture database gives administrators insight into a company's historical data to help set accurate DLP policies and reduce false positives. DLP monitor is available as a physical or a virtual appliance, that can detect and manage over 300 content types. It includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality.
· McAfee DLP Endpoint ­ controls data transfers that happen on endpoints via applications, removable storage devices, the cloud and more. It can block, alert, notify, encrypt, quarantine, and perform other actions on sensitive data on an endpoint. DLP Endpoint provides Web Post support for Google Chrome browser. It also includes out-of-box GDPR policies.
· McAfee Device Control ­ manages and controls the copying of data to removable media and storage devices, such as USB drives, CDs, DVDs, Bluetooth, imaging equipment, and more. Transfers can be blocked based on content, context, or device type. It is available for both Macs and PCs.
· MVISION Cloud Integration ­ extends DLP policies to the cloud. On-premises DLP content rules and policies can be synced with MVISION Cloud as well as applied to cloud services.
McAfee ePO (ePolicy Orchestrator) is McAfee's administrative console which can be used to set policies, manage incidents and workflows for all network and endpoint DLP components. McAfee also offers MVISION ePO, a cloud-native platform which can serve as a centralized administrative console. McAfee is migrating customers to the cloud-based platform.

STRENGTHS
· McAfee DLP is integrated with McAfee MVISION Cloud (its CASB offering), which helps organizations easily extend DLP policies into the cloud.
· McAfee ePO and MVISION ePO, provide single pane of glass incident workflow management, as well as allows for common policy management across endpoint, network and cloud DLP.
· The Capture database included in the McAfee DLP solution logs all data in motion and delivers valuable analytics to administrators about how data is being used and sent, which makes it also useful for forensic purposes.
· The McAfee DLP solution offers both automated and manual classification by end-users. The Manual Classification, which is included free in the DLP Endpoint license helps increase end-user data protection awareness and alleviate administrative burden.
WEAKNESSES
· McAfee DLP does not provide agent support for Linux.
· McAfee DLP does not offer specific features for Drip DLP detection. While such detection can be set up through rules, customers we spoke with indicated that it is somewhat cumbersome.
· While offering a rich set of features, McAfee DLP requires an experienced IT team to properly install and maintain the solution in a way that fully leverages its capabilities.
· While highly capable, a fully featured deployment of McAfee DLP tends to be somewhat more expensive than competing solutions.
· McAfee is undergoing a number of ownership transitions and management changes, first being spun off from McAfee as McAfee Enterprise, and more recently being united with FireEye Products into a combined company. At the time of this writing, it is too early to know what effect this will have on the company's future direction.
