Cybereason XDR Platform
UNDEFEATED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST RANSOMWARE

KEY CAPABILITIES
Don't Chase Alerts, Intercept MalOps Fully contextualized and correlated attack stories
Identify and End Attacks Faster Improve detection and response intervals by 93%

AI-Driven Security to Predict, Understand, and End Malicious Operations The Cybereason XDR Platform moves beyond endless alerting to instead recognize, expose, and end malicious operations before they take hold. Using one agent, one console, and one team to defend all endpoints, the AI-driven Cybereason XDR Platform was designed to expose and intercept every MalOp (malicious operation). A MalOp is not an alert, but a contextualized view of the full narrative of an attack. Only Cybereason provides the actionable intelligence to outthink the adversary, the remediation speed to outpace their operations, and the insights to end any attack.
THE TOOLS YOUR TEAM NEEDS

Leverage All Your Event Data Where other solutions limit data collected, Cybereason collects and analyzes 100% of event data
Remediate in Minutes, Not Hours Save time on on every investigation with guided remediation

The visibility to outthink Track, visualize, and end malicious operations with the full attack story from root cause across every affected endpoint, device, user identity, application, and cloud deployment.
The speed to outpace Analyze, adapt, and move faster than attackers, eliminating emerging threats in minutes rather than days. Whether a commodity attack or targeted threat, you'll understand the attack and remediate with confidence.
