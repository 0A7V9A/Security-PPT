PKI Offers Better Identity Security than Typical MFA Solutions
Identity is the new perimeter. How can you best protect the identities of your people, devices, and data?
Replacing Passwords with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) that Use Extra Phone or Token-Based Steps still Leaves Security Vulnerabilities.

NIST and FBI warn about MFA
due to exploits to SMS-based authentication methods that are as easy and scalable for attackers as stealing passwords.1

Microsoft and Google exposed
in the past year causing service outages and creating vulnerabilities for customers.2

Typical MFA can be defeated with one click
using common phishing techniques that easily trick people to share credentials
with malicious actors.

Often touted as a secure alternative to passwords, phone and one-time password OATH token multi-factor authentication solutions have many documented vulnerabilities and has been proven susceptible to high-profile attacks that are just as easy and scalable as stealing passwords.

The Most Effective Security Is Security that's Easy for Employees to Use. But with Typical MFA:

You still need passwords
making it not only more complex and time-consuming for employees, but forcing you to still rely on the technology it's intended to replace.

Your total cost increases
with expensive deployment and maintenance, and additional support calls on top of existing password support.

"51% AGREE
the day-to-day impact of security on employee productivity
" is increasing.4

AS RECENTLY AS MARCH 2020, there's a new TrickBot exploit
that plants a screen recorder on Android devices to steal credentials commonly used for bank websites.3

Simplify Employees' Experience with No-Touch PKI Authentication
PKI-based certificates not only offer the strongest form of identity authentication, but they also simplify the ability for employees to connect. The employee's identity certificate key is stored directly in their computer, laptop, or mobile phone, meaning they authenticate without requiring any action. The employee can simply access applications and start working.
