Email is a critical and essential communication and productivity tool for organizations, agencies, and institutions. Employees need to receive emails with content and attachments in a timely manner to avoid operational delays and productivity interruptions. Email crosses trust boundaries within and outside the organization, involving multiple business units like human resources, marketing, public relations, operations, and engineering.
Any employee with an email address ­ and especially those that interact often with the world outside your company ­ are vulnerable to zero-day targeted attacks with sophisticated phishing attempts and hijacked email conversations.
Threat Detection Issues in Existing Email Security
Existing solutions like secure email gateways, antivirus, and sandboxing provide a layer of protection against known malware already logged in threat databases. But unknown, new, and zero-day threats ­ or techniques that mask known threats like password-protecting or zipping files ­ evade these traditional approaches to email security. Organizations often default to blocking files to protect against unknown threats, which may or may not be present, decreasing productivity and delaying the delivery of mission-critical files and communications.

Votiro Cloud: Safe Emails Delivered Instantly
Votiro Cloud proactively removes malware threats from Office 365 email content and attachments, without significantly delaying email delivery.
