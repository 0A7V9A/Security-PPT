See Your Enterprise Through the Eyes of An Attacker

The hardest part of cybersecurity is deciding what NOT to do!
NodeZero provides continuous, autonomous penetration testing. With NodeZero, cybersecurity teams proactively find and fix internal and external attack vectors before attackers can exploit them. Don't waste time chasing down vulnerabilities that don't pose a threat to the business. Don't wait to fix problems until after you have been breached. Find, fix, and verify with NodeZero.
NodeZero Features
NodeZero is a true self-service SaaS offering that is safe to run in production and requires no persistent or credentialed agents. See your enterprise through the eyes of the attacker, identify your ineffective security controls, and ensure your limited resources are spent fixing problems that can actually be exploited.

Critical Impacts There are 2 types of security problems:
1. Urgent issues that require you skip lunch and cancel your plans.
2. Everything else that gets added to the backlog.
Node Zero filters the noise and identifies the critical impacts that must be fixed now to keep you from becoming the next news headline.

Path Attackers chain together vulnerabilities, harvested credentials, misconfigurations, and dangerous product defaults into attack vectors. NodeZero helps you understand how attack vectors lead to critical impacts, so you know exactly what to fix to disrupt the kill chain.

Proof Tired of dealing with false positives? Node Zero provides proof-of-exploit, showing exactly how an attacker can compromise your system.

Why Node Zero?
Accuracy ­ NodeZero will help you focus on fixing problems that can actually be exploited, saving you and your team from chasing down unexploitable vulnerabilities and false positives.
Effort ­ You're up and running an automated penetration test in minutes using our self-service portal or API. There are no credentialed agents to install or attack scripts to write.
Speed ­ You can assess your entire organization in a matter of hours, versus waiting weeks or months for consultants to manually run scans and produce reports.
Coverage ­ With NodeZero, you can assess your entire network, not just a sample. Our algorithm fingerprints your external, internal, identity, on-prem, IoT, and cloud attack surfaces.

Continuous You may be secure today, but what about tomorrow when your environment has changed? Continuously assess your security posture, and quickly compare NodeZero results to see where weaknesses have been found or fixed.

Safe NodeZero is designed to be safe to run in production. Define the scope of the operation ­ IP ranges NodeZero should stay within, IP ranges that NodeZero should avoid ­ or let NodeZero intelligently identify the scope for you. You also have the ability to enable or disable specific attacks, if you want to be extra cautious.
Available 24/7 Use Proactively ­ Your subscription is unlimited. Use it anytime to get the information you need about the current state of your network security. Don't wait until you have been breached. Find and fix attack vectors before attackers can exploit them. Remediation ­ Our goal is to create a bias for action ­ helping you quickly find exploitable problems, fix them, and then verify that the problem is no longer a threat. Red and Blue teams must work together, and NodeZero sets the conditions for a Purple Team culture!
