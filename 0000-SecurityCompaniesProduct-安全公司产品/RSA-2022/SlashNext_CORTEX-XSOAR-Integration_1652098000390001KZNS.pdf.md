USE CASE #1: ABUSE INBOX MANAGEMENT AND PHISHING IR

Challenge: Increased cyber awareness training and single-click reporting of suspicious emails by users have created a new problem for SOC and IR teams: effectively managing a growing abuse inbox with limited resources. Even with automated playbooks, inaccurate or inconclusive phishing threat intelligence can cause teams to miss genuine threats, or waste time and effort manually researching false positives.

Solution: Accurate, automated phishing URL analysis with a pre-built integration app to allows users to quickly operationalize SlashNext for definitive phishing verdicts on suspicious URLs. The patented technology dynamically inspects page contents using computer vision, natural language processing, site behavior analysis, and machine learning to identify threats while simultaneously retrieving detailed forensic evidence, including screenshots, HTML, and rendered text.

ABUSE INBOX MANAGEMENT PLAYBOOK

Benefit: Greater accuracy and threat coverage enables better automation of playbook workflows, reducing the time and effort required to effectively manage suspected phishing incidents.

USE CASE #2: PHISHING AND C2 THREAT HUNTING
Challenge: Phishing attacks have surpassed malware infections in recent years. Targeted attacks that used to be carried out by APT malware and RAT toolkits are getting replaced by more evasive phishing and spearphishing campaigns. A lack of accurate, phishing-focused threat detection and intelligence has made it difficult to identify phishing attempts in suspicious emails and C2 connections buried in network and endpoint logs.
Solution: Obtain real-time threat intelligence on phishing URLs and C2s with SlashNext Agentless Phishing intelligence and URL Analysis and Enrichment services using Cortex XSOAR threat hunting playbooks.
Benefit: Effectively identify and remediate phishing threats and compromised machines faster.
