MARKETING PARTNERS
Due to its vast scope and scalability, the indirect channel is an increasingly important distribution strategy for a converging and convulsing telecom and IT landscape. ChannelVision's bi-monthly magazine (along with its Web site, digital properties and events) is a direct conduit to the array of indirect distributors serving telecom/IT decision makers. Each issue puts your message in front of nearly 20,000 telecom agents, IT VARs, MSPs and integrators, as well as other types of channel distribution partners, selling all manner of voice, data, access, managed and business services.
To make sure your message gets seen, ChannelVision surrounds it with relevant and compelling editorial that avoids the over-covered, looks beyond the hype and filters out some of the noise ­ a leveling perspective that also proves important within this ever-evolving business environment.
"As much as 80 percent of SMB technology spending continues to move through indirect channels"
