Building vs Buying Insider Threat Solutions --The Unbiased Guide
(Let's face it, we're not fooling anyone)
Practical tips and insights from the team who built a leading Insider Risk Management solution, so you don't have to...

Introduction

If you're reading this guide, you're probably an insider threat expert--and you've got a ridiculously hard job.

And they aren't alone--74% of companies who experienced data breaches caused by insiders already had a data protection solution in place.

You're being asked to act with lightningspeed reaction times, accuracy, visibility, context, sensitivity and 100% conviction.
But your best toolset for the job amounts to an ad-hoc patchwork of solutions like Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and more.
And yet, our customers tell us that these tools--which focus on blocking, classification and policies--were burdensome and ineffective for detecting insider threats.

To us, this means the demands of the job have outgrown the current ad-hoc approach and it's time for an Insider Risk Management solution purpose-built for the job...something like...Code42 IncydrTM!
And there goes our unbiased cover.
Yes, we developed Incydr--a dedicated (and awesome) SaaS Insider Risk Management solution. So naturally, we think buying Incydr is better than building a solution based on a cocktail of ad-hoc applications.

Introduction Continued

But we know that as an insider threat expert you:

We are going to assess our insider threat solutions by asking three questions:

­ Make decisions based on rock-solid evidence.
­ Interrogate all options fully before acting. ­ Understand the importance of a bullet-
proof insider threat strategy.
So rather than just preaching to you about the huge benefits of Code42 IncydrTM, we are going to run it through an obstacle course-- side by side with the best alternative.
We will compare Incydr with an ad-hoc solution combining the likes of: Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and User Activity Monitoring (UAM).
This will give you all the intel you need to do what you do best: make great decisions that keep your organization and colleagues safe.

1. Is it effective? 2 Is it focused? 3. Is it fast?
These considerations aren't just `nice to haves', they're the pillars holding up the building.
Without them, you don't have a comprehensive insider threat program-- simple as that.
Not sure how an Insider Risk Management solution would provide value to your organization yet?
Take this assessment to see how vulnerable you are to a corporate data leak.
OK, let's get this head-to-head battle underway...

Introduction

Round 1: Is it effective?

We believe the effectiveness of an insider threat solution can be measured by how it tackles two key obstacles: blindspots and impact on productivity. Let the games begin!
ABlindspots

Obstacle A: Blindspots
Your solution needs to have a comprehensive handle on the data within your organization: which of your colleagues can access it, how they access it and what they do with it.
As a security professional, people trust your judgment, so you need to trust your tools.
This means you can't leave blindspots for bad actors to operate in.

The ad-hoc route:
Let's take a look at each piece of the ad-hoc solution puzzle in detail.
DLPs mitigate insider threat via continuous data monitoring and detecting if user activity violates a predefined policy. But they're only as good as the policies they rely on, so they can easily be circumvented.
UEBA gives you a comprehensive view of a user's behavior or their application activity, but you lose sight of what they're actually doing with data--and it's the data you're trying to protect.
CASBs, on the other hand, provide strong DLP-like capabilities but are limited to cloud-based applications and services. This means you lose visibility over USB drives, airdrops, browser uploads and sync app activity--requiring you to implement a second solution to oversee endpointbased exfiltration.

Round 1: Is it effective?

Mario Duarte, VP of Security at Snowflake, hit the nail on the head when discussing the blindspots of the ad-hoc approach...

"I can see that you connected, I can see
you downloaded something, but after that,
I don't know what you did with it. It's like
attempting to wrestle somebody with one hand tied behind your back."

The Code42 IncydrTM route
Incydr takes a simpler and more direct approach.

This comprehensive approach makes deployment and management time minimal by removing the cumbersome rule creation and refinement process.

This company-wide view of Insider Risk can then be broken down into a per-user view of how data is being used, shared and exposed.

It starts by monitoring for any file movement activity without the need for security to define what's acceptable or unacceptable by policy. From there, it filters out activity with corporate-sanctioned domains and prioritizes the risks that matter most using Insider Risk Indicators (IRIs).

It also illuminates data security blindspots by showing activities that fly under the radar of other security technologies.
Incydr covers vectors across laptops, email, cloud, mobile and lots more. And as it's one application, it pulls its findings together to give you a holistic view of data movement via a Risk Exposure Dashboard.

From here you can even navigate to a deeper Forensic Search and file any notable activities using our Cases feature.

BLoss of productivity

Obstacle B: Loss of productivity
Want a quick way to create resentment and make your job harder? Use a security system that adds complexity and stifles your colleagues' productivity in an effort to keep data safe.
Worse still, a system like that can create more security issues as well-meaning employees find workarounds to simply do their jobs effectively.
E.g. Adding an extra digit to a credit card number so it gets around blocking policies for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI)

The ad-hoc route:
Whilst it's deployed with good intentions-- to eradicate time wasted scrambling to perform incident response after a data leak--productivity isn't a strength area for the ad-hoc solution.

And all of this is before you count the time lost with DLP and CASB solutions blocking employees from completing legitimate business tasks.

Firstly, it can create cumbersome workflows.

And since it's all about cracking open files to look at content patterns, DLP implementation can also be a heavy load for employee devices to handle, meaning systems run slowly.

As Mario, VP of Security at Snowflake found out, this isn't always a matter of minutes either. One tool they tried slowed down their machines and interrupted their engineering workflow for a full 24-hours during a Proof Of Concept.

Round 1: Is it effective?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
Incydr doesn't inhibit employee collaboration--it was built to secure and enable it.
Firstly, to ensure minimal system impact, it performs a focused monitoring task on the endpoint and leaves analysis to take place in the cloud.

CrowdStrike, Snowflake, Okta and Ping Identity were all concerned about performance when they came to us-- they are now Incydr customers.
Incydr also doesn't slow down users and innovation when it's protecting data.
It achieves this by using prioritization-- weeding out what's trusted/legitimate activity and highlighting only what's actually risky.

When you combine this with comprehensive monitoring, you can trust that the need-to-know activity will be flagged, allowing the rest to continue uninterrupted.
Prioritization is also key for the next big challenge we address: focus.

"Code42 Incydr is the only solution we have found that gives us the visibility we need to understand where data is moving, while still letting our team work how--and where--they need to."
Dustin Fritz Senior Security Architect at UserTesting

Round 2: Is it focused?

Once you have eyes on all the data within your systems, you need to get your prioritization sorted out. Because if everything's critical, nothing's critical.
ANoise

To be truly focused, your insider threat solution needs to overcome three more obstacles:
1. Noise 2 Lack of context 3. Culture damage
Let's go!

Obstacle A: Noise
It's time to cut through the noise and get access to what you need--and only what you need.
And yet most solutions are, well... really noisy.
To act quickly and effectively--you want something clear, focused and actionable. You want signal.

The ad-hoc route:
UEBA solutions are great because they capture volumes of data on each user.
But the resulting alerts and system logs can be overwhelming, especially if you're running a large deployment. Plus, going through thousands of logs to see if anything really matters is boring--and boredom creates human-error gaps.

Round 2: Is it focused?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
It may feel counterintuitive, due to its comprehensive monitoring, but Incydr is all about noise reduction.

Firstly, it uses data preferences to establish trusted domains and filter out noise. Employees uploading documents to your own SharePoint site? Yeah, it won't bother you with that.

This means admins don't get buried under bags of alerts on approved corporate activities.

Admins can also establish a list of innetwork IPs so that Incydr can identify activity that occurs remotely vs in-network.

Round 2: Is it focused?

BLack of context

Obstacle B: Lack of context
The personal nature of Insider Risk Management means context is everything--welcome to the Everest of obstacles.
As only a fraction of daily activity actually represents risk and even less is actually malicious (more on this later), you need in-depth context to sort the regular work from the threats that matter.
And the ability to compile Cases of rock-solid evidence against malicious actors.

The ad-hoc route:
DLP software is great at stopping data leakage in its tracks--but it lacks the nuance to distinguish the business context of data or actions.
This means DLP can't see the forest for the trees when it comes to identifying colleagues who are a risk but not a threat.

Combining DLP with UEBA software means you can identify a wide range of anomalous behavior and potential insider threats--and get alerts on them--all of them.
Neither individually will give you the context you need--use them together and you'll need ear plugs for the wall of noise.

Situation: This man has a truck full of knives. Context: He's a butcher. Action: Don't call this man in for questioning.
Situation: This man has a truck full of knives. Context: He's a yoga instructor. Action: Question this man immediately.

Round 2: Is it focused?

Code42: Building VS Buying Insider Threat Solutions--The Unbiased Guide

11

Round 2: Is it focused?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
Incydr eats context for breakfast--on a platter of Insider Risk Indicators.
To provide a compendium of context without flooding you with alerts, Incydr uses Insider Risk Indicators (IRIs) to identify data that's at a higher risk of exposure or exfiltration.

These IRIs are fundamental to noisecancelling because they prioritize the risks that matter most.
IRIs can be based on the characteristics or behavior of a file, vector or user. E.g File indicators might be: File mismatch, zip file or resumé movement, source code exfiltration etc.
You can see more on our IRIs here

To zoom in further, Incydr also employs Risk Detection Lenses.
These provide a focused view of activity for a subset of users who are at a higher likelihood of putting data at risk.
These can include: colleagues hitting employment milestones (e.g. departure), or colleagues who are a risk factor simply because of their role's necessary access to data (see our butcher).

And if you want to get more info on the file itself--no problem.
Authorized security team members can view the file contents in an investigation, allowing you to verify the accuracy of anything Incydr flags as a risk.
This enables a new level of detection: guarding against instances where files are obscured to look like something else.

CCultural damage

Obstacle C: Cultural damage
Besides enabling effective insider threat identification, a crystal clear signal also affects work culture.
If you're constantly blocking, questioning, or (worse of all) falsely accusing your colleagues--it's going to cause a drop in morale...both theirs and yours.

The ad-hoc route:
In security's eyes, DLP and CASB can ensure that--in one fell swoop--ideal behavior is enforced.

Overly heavy restrictions simply aren't practical and will contribute to long lists of exceptions you need to manage, or the forced-workaround problem we mentioned earlier.

Don't want USBs used, or how-to-exportpriceless-IP.com accessed? Simple-- block them.

But this is also why these solutions become problematic. A blanket approach that treats everyone--good or not--like bad actors can be devastating for morale.

Round 2: Is it focused?

Code42: Building VS Buying Insider Threat Solutions--The Unbiased Guide

14

Round 2: Is it focused?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
When making Incydr, employee privacy was at the forefront of our minds.
That's why we took a different approach-- we hated subjecting our colleagues to invasive screen recording or keystroke logging that comes with user-based monitoring technologies.

So we tied all our monitoring to file activity-- after all, data is what needs to be protected.
Our Incydr data shows that only 1.8% of all data activity represents risk.
The majority is trusted collaboration--so a targeted approach with a whole vocabulary of actions beats a blanket approach that breeds distrust every time.

Round 3: Is it fast?

All of the above is irrelevant if your insider threat solutions can't operate at speed.
ASlow time to value

Aside from the effect on productivity covered above, there's two key ways that an inadequate insider threat solutions will harm your organization:
1. Slow time to value 2. Laggy trigger speed
Let the foot-race begin...

Obstacle A: Slow time to value
So you're ready to deploy or upgrade your insider threat solutions--you want to get operational, ASAP.
Compatibility and simplicity are key to making that happen.
Which is why it's frustrating that policybased solutions like DLP and CASB are hard to configure.

The ad-hoc route:
DLP isn't designed to be plug-and-play. Many aren't cloud-native, most don't have Linux and won't make friends with Macs.
DLPs and CASBs also need to be set up piece-by-piece for your organization's specific use cases--many even require manual data definition and classification, alongside complex rules and policies.
Olympic gold medal sprinters, they are not.
As the maintenance of the ad-hoc approach is equally time-consuming, some organizations simply opt-out.
Consequently, their solution becomes less and less effective and can (in the worst cases) also generate increasing amounts of false positives which erode trust.

Round 3: Is it fast?

Round 3: Is it fast?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
Compatibility isn't a problem if you're using Incydr.
It's cloud-native, environment-agnostic and works with whatever you've got: Windows, Mac, Linux, Google Suite, or Microsoft365.

Our deployment specialists help most customers deploy in 2 weeks with less than 10 hours of committed time--Olympians beware.
This speed is possible because Incydr doesn't rely on any policy setup.

You get value on day one without hours of upfront classification or fine-tuning of detection policies.
When it comes to updates--with Incydr, you're updating one cloud-native application--easy as pie.

Deploy the agent, input your trusted domains, and see your prioritized data exposure out of the gate.

In fact, you'll get 230% ROI in three years--that's a hefty number.

Round 3: Is it fast?

BTrigger time

Obstacle B: Trigger time

The ad-hoc route:

So, you've identified a threat or a risk and you want to take action with certainty--now.
There's no one-size-fits-all Insider Risk action. The goal is the right-sized actions at speed rather than just taking action.

For all the good that an ad-hoc system can offer, it lacks the prioritization of alerts that allow you to move with speed and conviction.

Does your system empower you to do that?

Round 3: Is it fast?

Code42: Building VS Buying Insider Threat Solutions--The Unbiased Guide

19

Round 3: Is it fast?

The Code42 IncydrTM route:
The context that Incydr provides arms you with the facts you need to move quickly.
Insider Risk Indicators (IRIs) assist you here, as each one has a risk score. The total of these scores defines the severity of the event, allowing Incydr to prioritize your highest risk users and their activities.
If any events need immediate action-- you'll know.

With Incydr, you can also take an appropriate action from a series of options that contain, resolve, or educate depending on an event's severity and the organization's risk tolerance.
Actions can be corrective conversations, additional user training, legal action, or even automated actions through Incydr integrations with systems such as SOAR, IAM and EDR-- goodbye blanket responses!

Additionally, you can compile, document, and disseminate evidence using our Cases feature and make fast, informed decisions about how to respond--these can then be exported easily.
Still not convinced on the speed of Incydr?
We worked with a higher education institution who--upon installation--was able to determine that a file contained information that would be a FERPA violation within three clicks and less than three minutes.

"Once deployed, it's an immediate data loss detection
solution. I wouldn't need someone to keep the rules up-to-date. The dashboard is simple and anyone can
identify where to review without much training."

An insider threat solution has to justify its value.
ACost

Let's explore how the two options stack up in terms of financial cost.

The ad-hoc route: Hold onto your wallet.

In order to get even remotely near the benefits of Incydr, you're also going to need to use UEBA, CASB and UAM--all of which ratchets up the cost.

And that's before we include the productivity costs incurred by holding data hostage.

Plus, remember the slow time to value? After a lengthy and costly implementation process you'll be left with an equally costly maintenance process.

All for a solution that can't guarantee you the speed, context, clarity, or conviction you need to actually do your job.
