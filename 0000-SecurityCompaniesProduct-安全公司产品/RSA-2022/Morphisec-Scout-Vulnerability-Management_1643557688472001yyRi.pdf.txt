Morphisec Scout for Vulnerability Management
It doesn't have to be difficult to reduce risk and prevent breaches

SCOUT YOUR TEAM AND YOUR ATTACKER
Your team needs software to do their job, and chances are they're running so many different applications that they can't stop for one more update or one more restart.
Know what that means? Vulnerabilities. Said vulnerabilities are susceptible to ransomware, supply chain attacks, zero days, and any number of still unknown threats.
Morphisec Scout automates your vulnerability management by prioritizing those applications your team uses around the clock to ensure you're not wasting your time, nor your team's time.
A GOOD SCOUT WASTES NO TIME
Not all vulnerabilities are equal. You know that and the attackers know that. Protect the applications you use most - those are the applications that attackers are looking to exploit.
A generic solution may find your vulnerable applications, but only with the cost of network performance. A next-gen AV may do well to predict your problems, but only at the cost of false predictions that demand your unneeded attention. Morphisec Scout keeps it simple and prioritizes your vulnerability management needs based on your most used applications.
Unknown threats abuse process memory at run-time and Morphisec Scout will ensure your applications run without any unwanted guests entering your network and without adding agents or taxing your endpoints in any way.
Scout is personalized to your enterprise in order to guarantee that your vulnerabilities are prioritized for patching, based on application usage. So when you receive your list, you know your priorities are based not just on a vulnerability, but a likelihood that the vulnerability is on an often used application.
