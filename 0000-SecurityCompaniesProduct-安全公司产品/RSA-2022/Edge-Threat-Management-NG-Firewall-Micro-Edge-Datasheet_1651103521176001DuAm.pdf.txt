Edge Threat Management | NG Firewall
Firewall can be run as a transparent bridge to complement a pre-existing rewall and allows administrators to control inbound and/or outbound access to speci c IPs and ports.
Intrusion Prevention
Stop exploits before they enter the network. Pre-con gured signature-based IPS makes it easier for administrators to provide 24/7 network protection from hackers. It minimizes annoying false positives and ensures that signatures are always current with automatic updates. With an easy-to-use setup wizard allowing simple con guration of rules speci c to each environment, Intrusion Prevention provides exible control. Over 34,000 signature detections, including heuristic signatures for port scans, enable you to e ectively monitor and block most suspicious requests.
Phish Blocker
Protect unsuspecting, click-happy users from identity theft attempts. Phish Blocker protects users from email phishing attacks and fraudulent pharming websites, and allows you to enable (or disable) the scanning of SMTP emails and take the appropriate action: Mark, Pass, Drop or Quarantine.
Threat Prevention
Block access to web and application content based on an analysis of the IP address's reputation. IP address reputation scoring is based on the Webroot BrightCloud® IP Reputation Service. This intelligent, real-time packet inspection categorizes IP addresses into ve distinct categories ­ High Risk, Suspicious, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, and Trustworthy.
Figure 1: NG Firewall Threat Prevention
Virus Blocker
Virus Blocker stops viruses at the gateway by leveraging signatures from BitdefenderTM, the leader in speed and e cacy in identifying emerging threats. Heuristic models provide an additional layer of protection against zero-day threats, and realtime updates with no system downtime ensure that your network is always protected. Virus Blocker identi es and blocks zero-day threats, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, botnets, unknown malware, and new infections.

Filter
Get a handle on every rogue application, encrypted web request, malware distribution point and rash of spam.
Ad Blocker
Eliminate ad and cookie tracking, while improving webpage load times. Based on the open source project AdBlock Plus, Ad Blocker lets you easily block ads at the gateway without installing browser plugins. Ad Blocker prevents malware and scams through banner ads while reducing tra c on the network.
Application Control
Control access to applications, which can be productivity drains and bandwidth hogs. Application Control performs deep packet (DPI) and deep ow (DFI) inspection of network tra c, enabling it to accurately identify thousands of common applications such as social networking, P2P, instant messaging, video streaming, le sharing, enterprise applications and much more.
Make sure that your users can access mission-critical and cloudbased apps while keeping recreational or inappropriate apps o the network. Application Control works in concert with Web Filter, SSL Inspector, Bandwidth Control and Policy Manager to give you the tools you need to enforce your user policies.
Figure 2: NG Firewall Application Control Report
Spam Blocker
Filters and quarantines fraudulent email--spam, phishing and email fraud--preventing it from reaching your users. Its smart analysis delivers a catch rate of 99.5% while minimizing false positives. Spammers constantly adjust their content and tactics to evade spam blockers. Spam Blocker is updated in real-time to keep you one step ahead of spammers. Quarantine is automatic and maintenance-free.
SSL Inspector
Decrypt, scan and re-encrypt HTTPS and SMTP tra c on the y. SSL Inspector creates a specialized certi cate on each client. This certi cate communicates directly with the gateway which is then able to decrypt HTTPS and SMTP tra c, process, and reencrypt it without ever exposing the decrypted tra c to the network. This enables HTTPS tra c to be inspected in the same

way as regular HTTP tra c, meaning that all NG Firewall apps and their rules can be applied.
Web Filter
Block inappropriate content at the gateway before it reaches users. Allow, block, ag or alert by category to easily set up rules that meet your criteria. Web Filter allows you to monitor and control searches across popular search engines including Google, YouTube, Ask, Bing, and Yahoo. You can also enforce safe search on YouTube, as well as log searches, giving you an unprecedented degree of visibility and control, ideal for content-sensitive environments like schools, public libraries, and social services organizations.
Perform
Ensure network performance, maximum uptime and QoS to increase productivity.
Bandwidth Control
Manage the priority of business-critical, recreational and inappropriate tra c. Ensure Quality of Service (QoS), utilize bandwidth resources e ciently, and prioritize bandwidth toward business-critical apps like VOIP, cloud-based business applications, or video conferences. Combine Bandwidth Control with Policy Manager to de ne di erent actions based on policies (user, group, time of day, etc.).
WAN Balancer
Distribute Internet tra c to optimize QoS over two or more connections. WAN Balancer helps you maximize your cumulative network performance and throughput by distributing the tra c based on simple rules. It also enables you to combine multiple commodity Internet connections into a cost-e ective alternative to pricey high-bandwidth connections.
WAN Failover
Reroute tra c automatically when one Internet connection fails. WAN Failover continually tests your Internet connections, and when one slows or fails, it can reroute network tra c over the remaining connections, maximizing your uptime. WAN Failover also logs all downtime for each connection, arming you with the evidence you need to hold your ISPs accountable.
Web Cache
Streamline and accelerate users' Internet browsing experience. Web Cache enables cached elements to be shared by all Internet users on your network increasing the responsiveness of web applications and reducing the bandwidth load.

Connect
Maintain visibility and control over remote workers, branch o ces and guest Wi-Fi to keep users connected and data safe.
Captive Portal
Easily manage Wi-Fi and guest access to the Internet. With Captive Portal you can require users to view or accept an Acceptable Use Policy before accessing the Internet (e.g. public WiFi), authenticate users against Local Directory, RADIUS or Microsoft Active Directory (requires Directory Connector), and separate mobile devices to a di erent rack with di erent policies for BYOD (bring your own device) environments.
IPsec VPN
Provide seamless, secure network access for branch o ces and remote employees. Uses cutting-edge security technology, supporting full tunnel or split tunnel, integrated with L2TP and Xauth. NG Firewall will detect VPN tunnel states immediately and automatically restart a tunnel in the event of downed connection.
OpenVPN
Enables SSL-based VPN that supports both site-to-site and client-to-site tunnels. OpenVPN can run as a server allowing for remote clients to connect to the Untangle server, and the OpenVPN application can connect to other remote servers as a client.
Tunnel VPN
Provide connectivity through encrypted tunnels to remote VPN servers and services. Tunnel VPN features a con guration wizard to enable connections to many privacy VPN providers like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Tunnel VPN is for connecting NG Firewall as a client to a remote server or service.
WireGuard VPN
Build secure, fast, and cutting-edge connections between sites and to remote users. For networks with one or more branch o ces or locations, WireGuard VPN creates an encrypted tunnel, enabling them to function as a single virtual network. Site-tosite tunnels with WireGuard VPN have very little overhead which ensures network bandwidth is maintained.
Manage
Create policies by user, group, device, and time to control access. Get complete visibility into network activity and tra c.
Directory Connector
Use Microsoft Active Directory or RADIUS to power policy management. Users can quickly and easily authenticate to the network, providing smooth, secure, and seamless access to the network. Network administrators gain visibility to each user as they authenticate, and can assign them to groups in the directory, simplifying and augmenting policy management.

Edge Threat Management | NG Firewall
Policy Manager
De ne and manage network privileges based on usernames, groups, time, day or protocol. Policies provide a way to segment network tra c to provide completely separate con gurations for tra c processing. For example, in a school network you could allow teachers to access Facebook but not students.
Additionally, administrators can con gure multiple applications in separate policies simultaneously using the Parent Policy system. Parent Policies provide a tiered organization of policies providing global policies at the Parent Policy level that apply to all tra c, and additional more customized policies for "child" tiers or levels below the Parent Policy.
Reports
Drill down into any feature or across all features by user, group, time and more. Comprehensive, or summary reports can also be distributed automatically via email to key stakeholders.
Con guration Backup
Enables recovery from hardware failures and disasters, and con guration pro les to be shared across multiple deployments of NG Firewall.
Branding Manager
