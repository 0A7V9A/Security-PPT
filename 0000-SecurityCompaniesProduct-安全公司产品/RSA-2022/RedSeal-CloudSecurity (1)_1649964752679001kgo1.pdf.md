SOLUTION BRIEF
RedSeal Cloud Solution
Ensuring Your Critical Cloud Resources Aren't Exposed to the Internet
A digital transformation is accelerating migration to the cloud, especially as so many people work remotely. Security teams are scrambling to manage security for resources in one, two or more public clouds as well as for resources remaining on premises. Most security tools only work in one of these environments, leaving security teams with common, urgent concerns:  What resources do we have across all our public cloud and on-premises
environments?  Are any of these resources unintentionally exposed to the internet?  What access is possible within and between cloud and on premises
environments?  Do our cloud deployments meet security best practices?  How do we validate our cloud network segmentation policies?  Are we remediating the riskiest vulnerabilities in the cloud first?

RedSeal's Cloud Security Solution

RedSeal's cloud security solution accurately identifies resources exposed to the internet. It brings all your network environments--public clouds (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and Oracle Cloud), private clouds, and on premises--into one comprehensive, dynamic visualization so that you can:
 Interpret access controls across cloud-native and third-party virtual firewalls (service chaining).
 Continuously validate and ensure compliance with your network segmentation policies and regulations.
RedSeal has helped customers identify issues in their cloud environments for immediate remediation, including:
 Cloud resource inventory. A healthcare customer expected "a few VPCs" in their cloud environment. RedSeal found more than a hundred. RedSeal helped the customer re-architect their cloud network to align with their cloud service provider's best practices and reduce their risk exposure.

RedSeal Fully Managed Services
RedSeal can also work with you on an ongoing basis with tiered fully managed services at three levels:
Cyber Visibility Includes network and endpoint inventory assessment and secure configuration assessments.
Cyber Compliance Adds network segmentation and compliance monitoring (PCI-DSS, NERC-CIP and internal policies) as well as security change reviews.
Cyber Risk Management Adds incident investigation; security posture monitoring; vulnerability risk prioritization and cyber risk assessment.
