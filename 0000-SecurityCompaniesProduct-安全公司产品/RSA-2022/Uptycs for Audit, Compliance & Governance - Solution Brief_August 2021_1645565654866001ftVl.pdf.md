CONTINUOUS COMPLIANCE ACROSS ALL MODERN ATTACK SURFACES
Regulatory compliance requirements are ever-changing, and non-compliance can mean penalties, data breaches, and loss of business. Demonstrating compliance across endpoint fleets, server workloads, and cloud infrastructure can be a heavy lift without the right tools. Uptycs can help you implement, monitor, and report on compliance policies across all your modern attack surfaces, bringing a new approach to security compliance and risk management. With our highly scalable, more performant, and on-demand security analytics platform, you get:

INSTANT COMPLIANCE POSTURE VISIBILITY
Having full visibility of your assets and their compliance posture at any given moment is essential. With the Uptycs compliance dashboards, you can instantly view your real-time compliance posture across all configured standards and see how it's changed over time.
For non-compliance, you'll quickly see the latest failed compliance checks, most non-compliant resources, time to resolve non-compliance and more, so you know where to focus remediation efforts. Drilling down into specific assets, you'll be able to gather associated evidence and get remediation guidance for each failing check to help you get back on track.

UPTYCS FOR AUDIT, COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE
In the event of an audit, you're able to ask ad hoc questions about your environment with both real-time and historical querying. Being able to look back at the compliance posture or configuration state of an asset at a specific point in time lets you easily gather evidence to keep an auditor happy.

ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE WITH EVENTS AND ALERTING
Uptycs can help you meet compliance requirements and bolster your security stack with our
event and alerting capabilities. Many regulatory standards require the use of security controls
and intrusion detection tools, such as File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), and the wealth of telemetry
Uptycs gathers allows you to meet those requirements. Uptycs can help you implement:

File Integrity Monitoring Behavioral Detection Host-based IDS

Vulnerability Detection Baseline & Outlier Detection Multi-method Malware Detection

With these security controls in place, you'll be immediately alerted, via email and Slack, to any unusual or suspicious activity happening in your environment.

SUPPORTED STANDARDS
Uptycs currently supports a variety of standards for many operating systems and cloud
resources, but the list is always growing as we continuously add to our compliance check
library. Today, Uptycs can help you achieve and monitor compliance for:

CIS Benchmarks SOC 2 PCI-DSS FedRAMP

HIPAA NIST 800 Series DISA STIG ISO 27001

Wherever your IT audit and compliance needs fall, Uptycs can help you get to where you need to be. Delivering a comprehensive solution for compliance and auditing, risk reduction and security hygiene, Uptycs helps you gain continuous compliance and reduce mean time to audits, detection, and response.
