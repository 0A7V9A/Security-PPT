YubiKey 5 Series: YubiKey 5Ci The Multi-Protocol Security Key
Streamline authentication for existing enterprise systems and pave the way to a passwordless future.
Relying solely on username and password security puts enterprise data at risk
Catastrophic security breaches top world headlines every day, and for good reason. A single corporate security breach costs an average of $3.86M1, and 81% of breaches are caused by stolen or weak passwords.2 As a result, IT organizations cannot rely exclusively on passwords to protect access to corporate data. Adopting stronger employee and customer authentication is essential to avoiding risk and becoming the next target.
From smart card to a passwordless future
The YubiKey 5 Series is a hardware based authentication solution that provides superior defense against account takeovers and enables compliance. The YubiKey offers strong authentication with support for multiple protocols, including existing Smart Card authentication, and WebAuthn/ FIDO2, the new standard enabling the replacement of weak password-based authentication. With the YubiKey, security is heightened with strong hardware-based authentication using public key cryptography. And the YubiKey is easy to use, fast and reliable and is proven at scale to significantly reduce IT costs and eliminate account takeovers.

YubiKey: Proven, easy-to-use security that's trusted by the world's leading companies

Eliminate account takeovers
Any software downloaded on a computer or phone is vulnerable for malware and hackers. The YubiKey is based on hardware with the authentication secret stored on a separate secure chip built into the YubiKey, with no connection to the internet so it cannot be copied or stolen.
Reduce IT costs
The YubiKey dramatically reduces the number one IT support cost--password resets--which cost Microsoft over $12M per month.3
By switching from mobile one time passwords (OTPs) to YubiKeys, Google saw the following results.4
 Zero account takeovers  4x faster logins
 92% fewer IT support calls

The YubiKey 5 NFC, YubiKey 5C NFC, YubiKey 5C, and YubiKey 5Ci fit conveniently on a keyring, while the YubiKey 5 Nano and YubiKey 5C Nano are designed to remain in the USB port. This ensures every YubiKey is easy to access and provides the same level of digital security.
Easy to deploy
IT can deploy YubiKeys in days, not months. A single key, through its flexible multi-protocol capabilities, can work out-of-the-box with hundreds of systems, both cloud and on-premises. This eliminates the need for costly integrations or separate devices for each system.

This graph illustrates how quickly Google reduced password support incidents after switching from OTP to YubiKey.4
Easy to use, fast, and reliable
Users don't need to install anything and can use the YubiKey in minutes. And the YubiKey is reliable because it does not require a battery or cellular connectivity, so it's always on and accessible.
