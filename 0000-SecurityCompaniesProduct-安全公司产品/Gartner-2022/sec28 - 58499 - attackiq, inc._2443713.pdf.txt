The AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform: Achieve Cybersecurity Readiness
Information security programs are complex systems composed of people, technology, and processes, and the only way to know if they work as intended is to test them continuously. Aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform is founded on the industry's leading breach and attack simulation technology to automatically test security programs for gaps, prioritize program strategies, and improve cybersecurity readiness.

Continuously Improve with Evidence
The AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform uses real-time performance data from automated adversary emulations to help improve the defense capabilities that matter most ­ from endpoint detection and response, to next generation firewalls, to security segmentation capabilities, to native internal security controls in cloud providers. It is also the industry's best deployment model for testing your controls at scale and in production; you can test on your laptop, in your home office, or wherever you want.
These images and the other images in this datasheet are illustrative of the AttackIQ Security Optimization Platform. For a full view into our product, please visit our demo page at: www.attackiq.com/demo.
