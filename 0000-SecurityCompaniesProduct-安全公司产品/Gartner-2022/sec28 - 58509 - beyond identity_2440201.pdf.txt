How It Works
Beyond Identity uses the proven asymmetric cryptography that underpins TLS and protects trillions of dollars of transactions daily.
Beyond Identity eliminates passwords and replaces them with private keys stored on the TPM, binding identity to your users' primary devices, enforcing device security policy at every access attempt, replacing passwords with cryptographic proof of identity, contextual analysis, and rule-based access management. For the user, that all takes place within seconds; after one click on their primary device, they are seamlessly and securely granted access.
Beyond Identity collects and analyzes dozens of user and device risk signals at the exact time of login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, risk-based access control.

How It Works
Beyond Identity leverages an innovative implementation of asymmetric cryptography that underpins TLS to completely eliminate passwords from the customer experience and your database.
Instead of passwords, Beyond Identity authenticates customers with two strong factors -- something you are from the device biometric and something you own from the private key -- without requiring a second device.
During authentication, Beyond Identity issues a challenge signed by the private keys in the device's secure hardware (TPM), evaluates user and device security risk in real-time, and makes a risk-based authentication decision based on your security requirements.

Unique Benefits:
Zero-friction authentication
Drive faster conversions by removing passwords and the need for second devices across native and web apps.
Cryptographic identity verification
Only allow the right customers to access the right account with immutable, device-bound identity attestation for each access request.

Privacy-preserving credentials
Preserve privacy with tamper-resistant credentials backed by private keys that are only owned by the customer and can't ever leave hardware TPMs.
Adaptive access controls
Configure dynamic access policies and step-up authentication using granular user and device risk signals captured in real time.

Secure DevOps
Verify every piece of source code was committed from a corporate identity and authorized device to stop software supply chain attacks before they start.

Protect source code from malicious attacks and deter insider threats

Key Benefits:

Attackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities in modern DevOps environments. Recent attacks ranging from Solarwinds and Kaseya to one of the most expensive in history - NotPetya - have shown the real exposure and massive cost of these attacks.
Companies have moved their agile software development life cycle (SDLC) to the cloud. Today, source code is one of a company's most valuable assets. In distributed cloud-based development environments, engineers can access and update source code anywhere from any device.
The only way to know your source code has not been compromised is to track every source code commit. Who made what changes from what device?
Beyond Identity Secure DevOps is the only product that secures the software supply chain at the developer level. Prevent malicious source code commits by cryptographically binding access and signing keys to a corporate identity and authorized device. Systematically inspect every commit so only source code that is signed by a valid corporate identity is built into the product.

Eliminate key sprawl and stolen credentials
Stop code injection at repo from non-authorized users
Protect access to build enviornments, infrastructure, and 3rd party tooling
Verifiable source code provenance for auditing and forensics

Verify source code is signed by a valid corporate identity
Secure your CI/CD pipeline. Place the Beyond Identity source code provenance check - a Git action or simple API call - at the beginning of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that only source code that is cryptographically tied to a valid corporate identity makes it into your build.

How It Works
Beyond Identity is the only way to secure the software supply chain at the developer level.
Beyond Identity validates that every Git commit is signed by a verified corporate identity and trusted device. This is done by cryptographically binding a valid corporate identity to the device by minting GPG keys and storing the private keys in the TPM hardware on the developer's authorized device. The private key cannot be moved, and therefore can be trusted. Beyond Identity ensures compliance for all developers. It's an easy one time set up for developers, then Beyond Identity signs all Git Commits in the background without any ceremony to access the private key. Beyond Identity is the only source code signing product thats stops Git Commits from non-authorized devices.

Signing keys are trustworthy
Developers mint their GPG keys using the Beyond Identity Authenticator, private keys are stored in the secure hardware and cannot leave the device. Key revocation is centralized and easy to manage. Beyond Identity's policies control which devices are authorized to create keys.

Restrict source code commit to corporate identites and devices
Only source code that is signed by a corporate identity using Beyond Identity is allowed in the build. There's a 1x set up for developers, then Beyond Identity signs source code behind the scenes for them without the need for a complex signing ceremony which ensures compliance.
Integrates with leading code repositories and CI / CD tools
By integrating your CI automation tool (eg, Jenkins, Bamboo, Circle CI) with Beyond Identity's Identity Verification API, you can show alerts with the CI tool, flag a build or fail a build if there are code commits are not properly signed by a valid corporate identity.
