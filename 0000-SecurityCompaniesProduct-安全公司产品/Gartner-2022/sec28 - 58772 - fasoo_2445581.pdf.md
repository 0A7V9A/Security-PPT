Critical information assets are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to improved connectivity, regulatory compliance, business collaboration requirements, and security vulnerabilities in complex multinational supply chains. These factors led to an increase of insider threats across all industries.
To effectively manage and remediate insider threats, organizations must establish a comprehensive and layered approach to data governance. Organizations must find ways to manage risks that adhere to policies and adapt based on behavior while users are handling data, regardless of its location or phase ­ at rest, in transit, in use.
Using a data-centric approach, Fasoo Enterprise DRM enables organizations to protect sensitive documents persistently on any device at any time throughout the entire document lifecycle. It protects, controls and traces any document format, including typical office documents, graphics, images and engineering drawings. Fasoo Enterprise DRM helps organizations manage insider threats, prevent data breaches and enforce the highest level of protection on unstructured data.

Fasoo Enterprise DRM is the most advanced file-centric security solution that allows organizations to protect, control and track sensitive documents. The solution is designed to meet the various security requirements of the different stages in the document lifecycle.
The solution provides attribute-based enterprise rights management with dynamic binding that integrates with back-end systems through encryption and identity APIs. Dynamic binding uses a very rich set of context attributes. Unnamed (external) users authenticate based on email only that does not require management of external credentials.
Fasoo has acknowledged the complexity that goes with defining perfect security policies by simplifying the management of exceptions, leveraging behavioral analytics and providing organizations with intelligence concerning policy optimization. Organizations can use this information to further optimize departmental policies.

Unstructured data is everywhere. Users can create, edit, move, delete files without proper authorization. Sensitive information is often in forms of unstructured data and may be stored in unauthorized and unsecured locations.
In order to enable organizations to gain insight into their unstructured data and enforce appropriate policies, they should first discover its location, volume, context; determine sensitivity level of the data to classify and apply adequate protection.
Fasoo Data Radar enables organizations to have visibility into the location of sensitive data, allowing them to remediate and enable controls. The solution can also allow organizations to understand context around the unstructured data, prioritize and protect it, remain compliant, and avoid data breaches.

Fasoo Data Radar is a data governance solution for discovering and classifying the constantly changing set of unstructured data based on its association with people and other characteristics, showing the data's security vulnerability and dynamically applying security policies on a continuous basis.
The solution can scan files throughout the enterprise to find content that is confidential or of high value. It can scan files located within folders and logical drives on PCs ­ that is, it can scan files on file servers, cloud storage servers, repositories, and anything else that can be mounted as a logical drive or shared folder. The files that Fasoo Data Radar scans match templates which specify criteria for confidential files to be classified and secured.

Wrapsody eCo is an intuitive and open collaboration solution that lets you securely share, track, control and remotely expire sensitive content. Content is always protected and under your control, internally and at third parties, with traceability and audit accountability meeting today's most stringent privacy regulations.

"Disconnected
information sharing applications hinder compliance with privacy regulations.

Companies collaborate with customers, partners and vendors to keep pace in today's competitive marketplace. This often requires sharing sensitive information that may be subject to privacy regulations, like GDPR, CCPA or NYDFS.
Today's solutions dictate that collaboration take place within the confines of a single vendor's portal to protect and meet privacy regulations. This hinders productivity and too often drives users to download and work outside this restrictive environment. This leaves data exposed to theft or loss, outside your control, and breaks the traceability required by privacy regulations.

Wrapsody eCo is the best way to securely collaborate with traceability to meet today's most stringent privacy regulations

Wrapsody eCo is different. It doesn't restrict you to working in a specific secure location. You can work the way you like, anywhere, with no disruption to your existing workflow. Files are always protected and in compliance to meet privacy and other data security regulations.
Wrapsody eCo simplifies secure collaboration by letting you easily share files while always maintaining control and auditability regardless of how users work.

Wrapsody eCo controls and protects your files with smart "Pac-n-Tag" technology wherever you access or store sensitive data. We encrypt files and restrict access (Pac) to individuals you choose. A unique identifier (Tag) is embedded with the file so it's never out of your control and provides deep traceability for regulatory audit requirements. Access through a browser or locally simplifies collaboration. It's all transparent with no disruption to user workflows.

Secure Collaboration Share secure documents internally and externally whether viewed in a browser, downloaded or edited locally. Pac protects the data itself and travels with the file to endpoints, clouds and other repositories rather than restricting protection to a location.
Workgroup Access Invite users to a workgroup that restricts access at the file level so you no longer need to manage encryption and access in a location. You can revoke access at anytime and restrict edit, print and screen capture as needed.

Audit Trail Tag travels with the file providing deeper traceability for regulatory compliance than restricted portals or secure location-based approaches. All file derivatives, including copies with different names and formats, inherit the security and traceability of the original file.
Virtual Content Tag lets users securely share files once and always have the latest version anywhere and anytime, even if users make copies or change file names.
