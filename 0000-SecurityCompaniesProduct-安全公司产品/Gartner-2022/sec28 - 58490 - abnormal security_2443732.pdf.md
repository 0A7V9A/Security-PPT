How to Stop the $1.8 Billion Problem
/ By Dr. Eric Cole

The Rising Threat of Business Email Compromise
Business email compromise (BEC) is the most significant cybersecurity threat to enterprise organizations, with $1.8 billion lost in 2020 alone. This type of email attack occurs when a cybercriminal uses social engineering to impersonate a trusted contact--typically an executive, coworker, vendor, or partner--in an effort to steal money or valuable information. Because these emails rarely contain malicious links or attachments, they are difficult to detect by standard email security protocols, leaving organizations wide open to attack.
New research from the IC3 Internet Crime Report shows that BEC attacks account for 44% of all losses due to cybercrime, making it the most dangerous threat for the sixth consecutive year.
Unfortunately, secure email gateways and other traditional security measures are unable to protect against these novel, never-before-seen attacks. Once they arrive in inboxes, your employees open and respond to them, putting your organization at risk of financial and reputational damage. Without a new approach, BEC will only continue to grow, and organizations worldwide will continue to suffer the consequences.

Types of BEC Attacks

CISO Guide to Business Email Compromise

BEC attacks can take on many forms, but they all rely on trusted relationships to complete their schemes. Here are a few ways attackers leverage social engineering to steal money and data from organizations.

Wire Transfer Requests
An attacker typically impersonates a well-known executive within the organization, oftentimes the CEO or CFO, and requests that an important wire transfer be completed immediately. The urgency of these requests often means that employees do not check the legitimacy of the email and complete the request--sending thousands of dollars to an account owned by the attacker.

Invoice Fraud
The target receives a fraudulent invoice from a known vendor in which the attacker changes the bank details to an account in their control. In some cases, this occurs when a vendor account has been compromised, but it can also be done through display name deception in hopes that the victim will not examine the email too closely.

Payroll Diversion
In these emails, the attacker impersonates someone at your company and emails a finance or HR employee to ask them to switch their payroll information to an account owned by the attacker. Oftentimes, the person being impersonated does not even realize that their payroll has been diverted until their paycheck does not appear in their account at the end of the month.

Gift Card Requests
Especially prevalent around the holidays, the requests are similar to wire transfer requests but instead ask employees to buy gift cards for an employee or customer appreciation event. After purchase, the attacker asks the victim to send the gift card numbers to them.

It's worth noting that business email compromise attacks can take many forms and often do-- these attacks can be part of larger credential phishing or account takeover schemes and can have dire consequences for both employees and their organizations.

Impact of BEC Attacks

CISO Guide to Business Email Compromise

The IC3 Internet Crime Report reports that there were 19,369 victims of business email compromise attacks in 2020, costing organizations an average of $96,000 per attack. Making matters worse is the fact that this number only includes successful attacks where victims are conned into sending money.
According to research by Abnormal Security, the impact of business email compromise attacks is much higher. An average organization receives more than 50 BEC attacks per month.

Percentage of Attacks that Employees Respond To:
20%

Most employees may be able to spot a BEC attack and react appropriately--either by checking the sender's email address or by verifying with the requester via an alternative method before sending money. However, research shows that 20% of employees engage with their attacker by responding to at least one email, and it only takes one successful BEC attack to lose millions.
And even if employees are trained on how to detect an attack and respond appropriately, cybercriminals are constantly revising their schemes, attempting to stay ahead of changes in technology and training, and oftentimes doing so successfully.

Why BEC Attacks Are Successful
To stop business email compromise, there must be a fundamentally different approach to the problem. The standard approach of implementing a secure email gateway no longer works, particularly because of the way BEC attacks are conducted.
Secure email gateways look for known issues--poor domain reputations, suspicious links, and malicious attachments among them. BEC attacks tend to slip through these gateways because they typically use legitimate domains and avoid both links and attachments.
Oftentimes, they are highly-targeted text-based emails that do not include traditional indicators of attack. And because they rely on social engineering rather than malware or ransomware to complete their scam, there is little that traditional email defenses can do to stop them.

If you look at a real-world example of an attack that bypassed the SEG, you can see why traditional defenses fail.
When these attacks land in inboxes, they rely on name recognition and urgency of the request. By encouraging their victims to move quickly, they successfully trick people into making mistakes. And based on the number of successful attacks, more people fall for it each year--despite an increase in security awareness training.
BEC attacks typically contain no traditional indicators of attack. It's only by understanding the intent that we can determine that it is liable to result in loss.
There is little denying that these attacks are incredibly difficult to detect, by both traditional defenses and humans. As BEC grows in severity, it's increasingly obvious that these attacks must be stopped before they can trick your employees.

How to Stop BEC Attacks
To counter these highly sophisticated attacks, large enterprise organizations need the right security platform. The next-generation of email security includes:
API Architecture
A solution that connects into Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace via an API and in doing so, provides access to the signals and data needed to detect suspicious activity. This includes unusual geolocations, dangerous IP addresses, changes in mail filter rules, unusual device logins, and more.
Behavioral Data Science Approach
The solution should use a fundamentally different approach that leverages behavioral data science to profile and baseline good behavior and detect anomalies. It should use identity modeling, behavioral and relationship graphs, and deep content analysis to identify and stop emails that include suspicious information or requests.
Organizational and Supply Chain Insights
A solution that understands both formal and informal organizational hierarchy and maps internal and crossorganizational relationships to understand typical communication patterns and behavior. It should include a focus on vendor relationships to protect against business email compromise, account takeovers, and other types of fraud throughout the supply chain.

Without each of these capabilities, BEC will continue to outpace security measures--making it even more difficult to prevent these attacks from reaching employees, creating financial loss, and causing reputational damage.

Conclusion
There is little doubt that business email compromise is a prevalent and financially damaging threat. By exploiting the relationships that people have established with their executives, coworkers, and partners, these attacks dupe both traditional email security tools and the humans they target. Stopping BEC requires implementing a solution that can detect and interpret the thousands of signals available via an API, and then monitor them for key deviations from known good behavior. It's only by stopping these attacks from reaching inboxes that we can truly ensure that our organizations will stay protected.

Fraudsters Use Email in Phone Fraud Scams, Targeting 89% of Organizations

Fraudsters Use Email in Phone Fraud Scams, Targeting 89% of Organizations

Executive Summary
Modern threats continue to increase in volume and severity, as cybercriminals turn from low-value attacks to more sophisticated, high-value strategies that rely on social engineering to trick recipients into sending money or leaking sensitive information. And because these threats contain few indicators of compromise, they evade secure email gateways and other traditional systems, landing in employee inboxes where they can cause significant damage.
New Malware Tactic Involves Phone Fraud
Starting in the spring of 2021, Abnormal noticed an increase in scams that encouraged recipients to do something fairly unexpected--pick up their phone and call the scammers. Once they do so, they are asked to download a file that contains BazarLoaders malware, from which cybercriminals can deploy ransomware. This relatively new tactic increased dramatically throughout the last half of the year, with nearly a third of all organizations receiving at least one attack in the third quarter, and over half in the fourth quarter. Probability of receiving an attack peaked in early December, with an 89% chance of attack for each organization.
Executives Impersonated Less... But Attacked More
While the number business email compromise attacks per 1,000 mailboxes nearly doubled this half, impersonation tactics have changed. While we've traditionally seen attacks impersonating VIPs, there was a 32.7% decrease in attacks impersonating executives from the first to last quarter of 2021. In contrast, the number of attacks received by these same executives increased by nearly 24% over the same period.

Email Attacks Increase in Volume as Cybercriminals Change Tactics
As email security becomes more prevalent for organizations worldwide, we may expect the number of email attacks to drop, as cybercriminals look for new ways to penetrate organizations and complete their scams. Data from the last year shows that this is simply not the case.

Attack Volume Increases by 10%
Over the course of the last half of 2021, overall attack volume increased by 10.33%, from an average of 58.26 attacks per 1,000 mailboxes to an average of 64.28. While no singular attack type stands out as the culprit here, it's clear that threat actors are continuing their schemes, focusing on tricking end users into providing credentials and sending money to their bank accounts. One interesting callout is that while the holidays tend to be a slow period as employees take time off to spend it with their families, the same can be said for these threat actors. The average weekly attack volume dropped significantly in the last two weeks of the year, from an average of 59.97 per 1,000 mailboxes in the second week of December, to only 22.44 attacks the week between Christmas and New Year's Day.

When looking at attack type, the percentage of attacks focused on credential phishing dropped a bit, while scams and business email compromise rose. This could be attributed to the fact that cybercriminals are seeing more success with text-based attacks that bypass traditional security tools, so they're moving away from attacks that include a link--a common attribute in credential phishing attacks.

Phony Phone Fraud Starts with Email
Starting in the spring of 2021, Abnormal noticed an increase in scams that encouraged recipients to do something fairly unexpected--pick up their phone and call the scammers. These emails use a variety of scare tactics, often involving a pending charge, to prompt their targets to call the phone number provided within the email.

Once they do so, they are directed to a website to download some type of file that then installs a form of malware, typically BazarLoader, on their computer. This initial installation allows attackers to then install additional malware that can be used for ransomware attacks.

An Emerging (and Growing) Trend

Vishing, or voice phishing, has become an increasingly popular tactic in recent years, but these phone fraud attacks are different in that they start with a phishing email. They then direct users to call them, versus directly calling the target as part of the vishing scam. These phone fraud attacks are likely geared toward consumers, but it is clear that threat actors were willing to scam organizations as well--and may even prefer them. In cases uncovered by Abnormal, impersonated brands included PayPal, Microsoft, Amazon, Norton AntiVirus, and Best Buy, all of which could be used for both personal and business transactions.

59.2%
chance of receiving a phone fraud attack in December.

These phone scams were first detected in the first part of the year, but started increasing in the third quarter and picked up significantly in December--right before the holidays, perhaps when the scammers knew that people would be more concerned about money being unexpectedly deducted from their bank accounts.

The likelihood of receiving these attacks increased dramatically throughout the last half of the year, with 31.4% of organizations receiving at least one attack in the third quarter, and over half in the fourth quarter. But that number jumped even more in December, with organizations reaching a 59.2% likelihood of attack in the last month of the year. The highest week saw a 89% chance of attack, before dropping back to average levels closer to the holidays.

Education and Religious Organizations at Highest Risk for Phone Fraud Attacks
While all industries are targeted by these phone fraud attacks, there was one that had a significantly higher chance of receiving an attack: education and religion. Perhaps because this industry is comprised largely of nonprofits who may not have the budget for email security tools, organizations within the industry had a 82% probability of receiving an attack like this in the last three months of the year.
This was followed by the insurance and media industries, both with over a 60% probability of attack each week in the fourth quarter. Shortly following were retail and consumer goods, professional services, and hospitality with more than a 50% probability of receipt.

Size of Organization

While business email compromise attacks mainly target executives or those in the finance department, these phone fraud attacks could be relevant to almost anyone. As such, it makes sense that the chance of receiving an attack simply grows alongside the number of people within the organization.
No matter the size, one thing is for sure--threat actors saw success with phone fraud attacks in 2021 and doubled down on this attack type in the last quarter of the year. It remains to be seen if this trend will continue into 2022, particularly as end users become more aware of the tactic.

Supply Chain Compromise Risk Remains Steady
Known also as vendor email compromise, supply chain compromise is a relatively new cyber threat in which cybercriminals successfully phish for vendor email credentials, access the email accounts, and then use those compromised accounts to send attacks on partners--often related to an unpaid invoice or a billing account update.
Because the threat actor can use the compromised account to access past and ongoing conversations and then use that knowledge to trick recipients, this attack type is extremely dangerous to those who receive one of these emails.

Threat Remains Constant Across 2021
Since Abnormal has tracked supply chain compromise, the risk has continuously increased, at least until the last half of 2021 where it remained steady for the first time. That is not to say that the threat should be taken lightly, as more than a quarter of all Abnormal customers were the target of at least one of these threats each week.

This means that nearly two-thirds of all customers are likely to receive at least one attack over the course of the half. And with the average attack size remaining at $183,000, this is not a threat to be taken lightly.

Large Organizations Still at Largest Risk
Similar to what we've seen with phone fraud attacks, those organizations with more employees are simply at the largest risk of receiving an attack. While this is likely a result of there being more employees to target, particularly within the finance department, some of this can also be attributed to the fact that larger organizations often have more vendors who can become compromised. When it comes to the numbers game, cybercriminals often win.

It's only when looking at small businesses that there is a small amount of relief, with threat actors hitting those with employee counts below 500 only one week in every three.
Regardless of the reason, the issue is clear--all organizations must secure their email from vendor fraud, particularly because these attacks are nearly impossible to recognize by the human eye.

Significant Increase in Business Email Compromise Attacks
While BEC attacks make up only a small percentage of all advanced attacks, they are especially concerning because they use impersonation of an employee or trusted partner to establish rapport with the victim and convince them to engage in actions such as paying fake invoices, buying gift cards, or providing access to sensitive data. This half, there was an astounding 84% increase in these attacks over the previous half of the year.

By sheer numbers, business email compromise attacks are not that common--with an average of only .44 attacks per 1,000 mailboxes in the first half of the year. That said, the number of attacks climbed to .82 per thousand mailboxes in the second half of 2021. One interesting note is that there were six weeks over the half where there was at least one attack per thousand mailboxes--peaking at 1.37 attacks in early December.
And it's important to remember that volume does not equal value when it comes to business email compromise. One successful attack could have dire financial or reputational consequences for an organization.

Small Businesses Receive Most BEC Attacks per Mailboxes
Because business email compromise is highly targeted, it does not necessarily grow alongside the size of the organization like more broad-based attacks. Instead, a pattern where the number of attacks decreases as the organization gets larger indicates that the attackers are targeting specific roles, often executives and those in the finance department.

95%

chance of receiving a BEC attack each week for organizations with 50,000+ employees.

This half, organizations under 5,000 employees received the most attacks, with those between 1,000-1,500 employees receiving 1.59 per 1,000 mailboxes each week. In contrast, organizations larger than 50,000 employees received only .13 BEC attacks per 1,000 mailboxes each week--highlighting the fact that cybercriminals target specific roles as part of these schemes. That said, due to sheer volume of mailboxes, those organizations with more employees have a higher probability of receiving at least one attack each week, with the largest organizations peaking at 95% chance of attack.

Fraudsters Use Email in Phone Fraud Scams, Targeting 89% of Organizations
Retail and Agriculture at Highest Risk for Business Email Compromise
Four industries received more than one attack per 1,000 mailboxes each week: professional services, technology, construction and engineering, and retail and consumer goods. But when it comes to probability of attack, retail and agriculture take the top spot--both with a 83.2% chance of receiving at least one BEC attack each week.

One interesting note is that finance and real estate, two industries that are typically some of the most targeted, were at the bottom of the list--with only a 60% and 50% chance of attack, respectively.

Fraudsters Use Email in Phone Fraud Scams, Targeting 89% of Organizations

VIPs Impersonated Less, But Attacked More
With business email compromise, it's common to see executives and other important names impersonated in an effort to use name recognition to convince the target to complete the request. However, as more end users become aware of this tactic, threat actors seem to be shifting their impersonation strategy.
This half, executives were targeted less frequently as a percentage of all attacks, continuing a downward trend that started in the first half of the year. And while they are still one of the most commonly impersonated parties in BEC attacks, they lost the top spot to impersonations of general employees in H2 2021, perhaps as cybercriminals turn to less obvious impersonation tactics to trick unsuspecting victims.

One interesting note here is the move from impersonating the VIPs to targeting them, with a 23.9% increase in executive targeting between the first and last quarters of the year--indicating a significant shift in strategy. What did stay consistent is the fact that the most common party impersonated in attacks that target executives is actually other executives, such as the CFO being impersonated in an email to the CEO.

Cybercrime is an evolving game. As organizations and employees become more aware of one tactic, the strategy will shift in an effort to stay one step ahead of email security platforms and security awareness training. This change is one indicator that those shifts are already occurring, and that we can expect to see more in the future.

Fraudsters Use Email in Phone Fraud Scams, Targeting 89% of Organizations

Expect an Increase in Modern Attacks
It's clear that modern email attacks like business email compromise and supply chain fraud will continue to be a threat to organizations worldwide, as cybercriminals shift tactics to stay ahead of both technology and humans. And the new focus on phone fraud scams shows that these threat actors will try all types of tricks to make money.
What all these email attacks have in common is that they are almost exclusively text-based in an effort to bypass traditional email security tools that look for malicious attachments and links. When those traditional indicators of compromise are not included, these attacks reach inboxes where they can cause significant financial losses and data breaches.
While we expect all types of modern attacks to continue to increase, both in volume and severity, they can be stopped with the right solution--one designed to detect identity, context, and content to understand normal behavior and block those emails that deviate from the baseline. With a layered defense, you can ensure that your employees and your executives are protected from the attacks that matter most.

Abnormal Integrated Cloud Email Security
Protect your organization from advanced email threats, unwanted email, and account takeover attacks.
Protect your end users from the full spectrum of targeted email threats: phishing, ransomware, fraud, social engineering, supply chain attacks, executive impersonation, spam, and graymail. Detect and remediate compromised accounts. Integrate with Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace via a one-click API without disrupting mail flow. No MX record changes, configuration, or custom policies are needed.
Highest-Precision Protection Against All Attacks
Secure email gateways struggle to block sociallyengineered attacks that pass reputation checks, have no links or attachments, and appear to come from trusted sources. The Abnormal Integrated Cloud Email Security (ICES) platform profiles known good behavior and analyzes over 45,000 signals to detect anomalies that deviate from these baselines, and then precisely blocks all socially-engineered and unwanted emails--both internal and external--and detects and remediates compromised accounts.

Remove Your Secure Email Gateway and Simplify Your Email Security Architecture
Organizations that require comprehensive inbound email protection are stuck with multiple products, incompatible architectures, unnecessary expense, and management overhead. With ICES, you can simplify your stack by eliminating the redundant email gateway layer and re-enabling and enhancing Microsoft's cloud gateway capabilities.

Customer Success Story
Fortune 200 Asset Management Company Protects Customer Wealth from Email Threats
As a leader in insurance and asset management, this Fortune 200 company recognizes that its security must protect its employees and customers from cyber attacks. Customers place their trust and their assets in the control of this company, so the security team built a robust solution reducing risk, gaining visibility, and securing user identity--the new perimeter.
After experiencing thousands of credential phishing attacks and a number of successful account takeovers, where threat actors would gain access to employee email accounts, this insurance company knew they needed additional protection for their Microsoft 365 environment. Despite having a secure email gateway and other additional protections, they were still uncomfortable with the number of advanced email attacks bypassing their security infrastructure.
They chose Abnormal Security due to the visibility it provided into their email environment, the number of advanced email threats it detected, and the number of compromised accounts it remediated. With this added layer of security, this company is better protected from business email compromise and account takeovers, ensuring that they--and their customers--remain safe from cyber attacks.
