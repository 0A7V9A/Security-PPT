SOLUTIONS BRIEF
Security for Email & Multi-Channel Communications
Stop social engineering attacks, insider threats, ransomware, and policy violations in your workplace communications

HUMAN COMMUNICATIONS ARE INSECURE
Humans will always be the weakest link in security strategies because enterprises can no longer contain where and how their employees communicate.
SafeGuard Cyber detects business compromise attacks by understanding how humans interact. The SafeGuard Cyber platform integrates directly into workplace communication channels via APIs and uses patented Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology and cloud-based machine learning (ML) to detect security incidents and compliance violations for 52 languages. With the unique ability to understand the context and intent of communications, companies can now properly manage risk.
