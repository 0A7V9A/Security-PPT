CONVERGED ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT | XEM
Our world today: increasing IT complexity and vulnerability
Every 11 seconds, there is a ransomware attack. Yet organizations are spending over $160B on cybersecurity this year alone. While security budgets are rising every year, the vulnerability gap isn't improving ­ it's only getting worse.
In addition, organizations are using more tools than ever before, trying to tame the proliferation and complexity of endpoints. But this visibility gap isn't closing ­ it's growing. In fact, 20% of all endpoints remain undiscovered and unprotected. It's creating a huge hole for hackers to exploit.
The current approaches our industry has been pushing are flawed. Other IT security and management providers offer only a small piece of the solution required to protect our environments. They represent a patchwork of point solutions deployed across IT Operations, Security, Risk and Compliance groups. CIOs and CISOs are forced to buy tens of these different solutions, stitch them together themselves and make decisions based on data that is stale, inaccurate and incomplete. The reason why so many enterprises fall victim to ransomware attacks is that the tools they use are no match for the sophistication of attackers: tools are slow, unreliable and lack a common dataset to operate from. And they inherently create silos.
Why silos don't work
Silos don't work in IT.The old model of unreliable tools, broken processes and incomplete outcomes is being disrupted. Unified platforms enabling the flow of information across teams can surface critical data faster from more sources, helping teams adapt and respond quickly to resolve issues.
IT Operations and Security teams face overlap that requires necessary collaboration."IT Operations vs. Security" will become "IT Operations & Security" to tackle challenges as one team ­ one fight.
Companies need a solution that solves for endpoint explosion, tool proliferation and IT modernization holistically: every endpoint, every workflow, every team.Given the multitude of changes impacting IT, it is critical that organizations prioritize solutions giving visibility across all their endpoints, control of those endpoints, and confidence in the quality of the data generated. The IT world needs a converged solution.
Introducing Converged Endpoint Management (XEM)
Converged solutions solve the technology problem so companies can focus on the organizational problem. Converged solutions should transcend technology: they need to enable a business solution. By enabling better

communication among teams, and by providing visibility of assets, control of those assets, and trust in data affecting those assets, teams can make informed decisions more quickly.
Converged solutions unite tools and data into one unified solution. A converged solution is a system that enables convergence: it acts as the backbone for all crucial interactions between data, tools and teams to take place. It lives at the intersection of the domains in IT Operations, Security, Risk and Compliance Management.
Converged solutions appeal to a wide range of users, enabling IT leaders and employees to collaborate.
The Tanium advantage
Tanium is the world's first converged endpoint management solution: a single platform that can identify where all your data is, patch every device you own in seconds, implement critical security control tools and do it all within a single pane of glass. A single platform that provides real-time data and has real-time impact. We make IT scale: gone are the days of siloed teams referencing different datasets.
Tanium protects against attacks by orchestrating all activities within a single platform that's fast, reliable and inherently integrated. Combining the reach of IT Operations, Security, Risk and Compliance Management into one location breaks the cycle of unreliable tools, broken processes and incomplete outcomes across siloed teams ­ enabling the ability to obtain business insights quickly, reduce time to incident resolution, and lower IT cost and complexity.
Tanium is converging tools across the IT Operations, Security, Risk and Compliance Management space to bring teams together: one platform to give complete visibility, control and trust in IT decision-making. That's the power of certainty.
