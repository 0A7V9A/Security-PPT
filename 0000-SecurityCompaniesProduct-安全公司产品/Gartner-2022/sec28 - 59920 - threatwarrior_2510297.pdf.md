Cloud-Native Network Detection and Response

The Next Generation of Cybersecurity
ThreatWarrior is the only Cloud-Native Network Detection and Response (NDR) platform that delivers the visibility, speed, and e ciency to stop increasingly complex attacks across the enterprise. We empower security teams to detect, investigate, and respond to attacks across cloud environments, IoT and OT, hybrid architectures, containerized applications, on-premises ecosystems, and more.
ThreatWarrior's NDR platform is powered by multiple engines that work together to correlate network events and behaviors to deliver maximum contextual intelligence. Our platform provides the right data at the right time so your team can take fast, con dent action against threats.

Cloud Entity Detection

ThreatWarrior autonomously discovers everything communicating across the network in real time, classifying every device so you have an always up-to-date inventory. Plus, we examine network tra c -- the ground truth of what's happening on your network -- to provide a hyperaccurate overview of all network activity.
Our platform also uses natural language processing on vast amounts of threat data to identify patterns and analyze threats at unmatched speed and scale. We correlate that intelligence with data gathered from your environment to deliver a dynamic threat scoring model which prioritizes the most critical threats and lters out low-value events to keep analysts focused on the highest-risk activity, and keep your organization ahead of cyberattacks.
The solution utilizes deep learning to determine a baseline of normal behavior for your entire network and everything connected to it. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques to detect anomalies and mitigate cyber threats, going beyond the capabilities of Bayesian machine learning, agent-based solutions, log readers, and other legacy techniques. Put simply, our technology stops threats others can't.

"ThreatWarrior is helping solve a critical problem in cybersecurity -- a lack of contextual intelligence and visibility across the enterprise, including public cloud environments. ThreatWarrior aggregates intelligence, analyzes behavior and correlates context on-premises and in the cloud to identify attacks wherever they occur."
MICHAEL SENTONAS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, CROWDSTRIKE
