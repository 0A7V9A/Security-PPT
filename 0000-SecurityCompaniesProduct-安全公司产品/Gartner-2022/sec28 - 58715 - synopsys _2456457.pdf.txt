Black Duck
Software Composition Analysis

Secure and manage open source throughout the software supply chain

Overview
Black Duck is a comprehensive solution for managing security, license compliance, and code quality risks that come from the use of open source in applications and containers. Named a leader in software composition analysis (SCA) by Forrester, Black Duck gives you unmatched visibility into third-party code, enabling you to control it across your software supply chain and throughout the application life cycle.
An integrated solution for source and binaries
Only Black Duck combines versatile open source risk management with deep binary inspection to provide a best-in-class SCA solution that helps you minimize risks associated with open source and other third-party software. In a time when open source composes 70% of the average codebase, Black Duck empowers your development, operations, procurement, and security teams to:
· Find and fix security vulnerabilities at each stage in the SDLC, with detailed, vulnerability-specific remediation guidance and technical insight.
· Eliminate risk of open source license noncompliance and safeguard your intellectual property by using the industry's largest open source knowledge base to identify which of 2,750 licenses are relevant to the open source in your applications (including code snippets from larger components).
· Avoid development cost overruns and combat code decay with operational risk metrics associated with poor open source code quality.
· Scan virtually any software, firmware, and source code to generate a comprehensive bill of materials (BOM) of what's inside.
· Automatically monitor for new vulnerabilities that affect your BOM, with custom policies and workflow triggers to accelerate remediation and reduce your risk exposure.

Get deeper, more streamlined analysis
Black Duck identifies more open source, with greater accuracy, using a unique multifactor detection technology to generate and validate a complete BOM to track declared components, unique file hash signatures, dependencies resolved during a build, and open source code snippets. Black Duck applies these scanning methods in an efficient manner, bringing security and compliance to every stage and role in the SDLC. This includes Rapid Scan in the IDE, and integrations with CI/CD and binary repository tools for deeper analysis during build and post-build stages.
Find and fix vulnerabilities quickly
Black Duck's open source security risk insight combines curated data from public sources (e.g., NVD) and detailed, proprietary analysis from the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC). Get notified of new vulnerabilities weeks before they are published in the NVD (reducing your window of exposure), and benefit from our exclusive enhanced vulnerability data and Black Duck Security Advisories (BDSAs), including:
· Critical risk metrics, vulnerability-specific technical insight, exploit details, and impact analysis
· CVSS 2 and CVSS 3 scoring and CWE classification data · Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) · Temporal scoring not provided by the NVD · Component-level upgrade and remediation guidance, mitigating factors, and
compensating controls · Vulnerability impact analysis to determine if the vulnerable code is being called by the
application · Custom vulnerability risk scoring to match your company risk profile · Vulnerabilities are prioritized for remediation across multiple critical data points, including
severity, solution availability, exploitability, CWE, and reachability
Automatically enforce security and use policies
Configure your open source security and use policies based on a comprehensive array of criteria, including license type, vulnerability severity, open source component version, and more. Enforce policies with automatic workflow triggers, notifications, and bidirectional Jira integration for accelerated remediation initiation and reporting.
Identify open source risks, even without source code
With Black Duck in your toolkit, you can quickly and easily analyze vendor-supplied binaries to identify weak links in your software supply chain without access to the source code. Get deep, actionable risk metrics to make informed decisions about your use and procurement of technologies before they put you at risk. Black Duck's intelligent scan client automatically determines if the target software is source or a compiled binary, then identifies and catalogs all third-party software components, associated licenses, and known vulnerabilities affecting your applications.

Overview
Coverity® gives you the speed, ease of use, accuracy, industry standards compliance, and scalability that you need to develop high-quality, secure applications. Coverity identifies critical software quality defects and security vulnerabilities in code as it's written, early in the development process when it's least costly and easiest to fix. Precise actionable remediation advice and context-specific eLearning help your developers understand how to fix their prioritized issues quickly, without having to become security experts. Coverity seamlessly integrates automated security testing into your CI/CD pipelines and supports your existing development tools and workflows. Choose where and how to do your development: on-premises or in the cloud with the Polaris Software Integrity PlatformTM (SaaS), a highly scalable, cloud-based application security platform. Coverity supports 22 languages and over 70 frameworks and templates.
Coverity includes Rapid Scan, a fast, lightweight static analysis engine that can be used to scan web and mobile applications, microservices, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations. Rapid Scan runs automatically, without additional configuration, with every Coverity scan and can also be run as part of full CI builds with conventional scan completion times. Rapid Scan can also be deployed as a standalone scan engine in Code SightTM or via the command line interface, as well as in automated build pipelines, For this use case, Rapid Scan provides actionable early results in seconds for most projects. It's easy to use: simply point to a directory or Git repository--no setup is required. Broad support for platforms and file formats makes it easy to scan IaC configuration files. API and configuration checkers can help identify API misuse and vulnerable configurations in settings files. This is ideal for developers who want immediate analysis feedback, while they are coding and with every code commit. Support for multiple analysis output formats (SARIF, JSON, and console) as well as GitHub Actions and GitLab CI provides pipeline scan automation and issue management support. Rapid Scan can also assign issues to a policy file to automatically break builds.
Key features
