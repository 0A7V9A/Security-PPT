A BETTER WAY TO MANAGE VULNERABILITIES
As RBVM programs have begun to mature, there has been a shift from older CVSS only based programs towards vulnerability prioritization by the incorporation of external threat intelligence. However, many organizations that have adopted this style of vulnerability management program have come to the same conclusion: Simply adding in threat intelligence does not equate to true prioritization. The key to unlocking the power of threat intel lies within the context of business importance. With business importance, organizations are able to better reduce the number of lower priority vulnerabilities and distill out an actionable and effective remediation plan. The following is an example of this evolution in vulnerability management:
From a starting size of 1.23 million unique instances of vulnerabilities in this sample organization, NorthStar was able to determine only 0.068% (834) of the vulnerabilities discovered in the environnment were of a critical priority and required immediate action. This significant reduction highlights the impressive flexibility of the NorthStar model and empowers vulnerability management efforts by breaking down the large list of vulnerabilities into a manageable, laser-focused list that shows how to drive action to best protect the organization.
NorthStar Navigator was created to maximize the effectiveness of remediation efforts by focusing organizations on the problems that really matter and providing clear, actionable paths to remediation and lower overall risk.

YES/NO FORECAST FOR VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT

EASY ANSWERS TO HARD QUESTIONS
Is your vulnerability management program able to clearly delineate between vulnerabilities that are unexploited versus ones that are either currently being actively exploited in the wild or are predicted to be exploited in the wild?
NorthStar is the ultimate vulnerability prioritization and prediction engine.
In addition to automatically identifying vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild, NorthStar's vulnerability prediction engine accurately identified over 45% of the vulnerabilities that would be exploited in the wild at some point in the future, providing an average notice of around 280 days in advance.

HOW IT WORKS
Prediction begins with the collection of surveillance data that captures the footprint or breadcrumbs left behind on-line by attackers seeking to develop, deploy, and monetize exploits that are capable of leveraging an existing vulnerability. The appearance of these events and activities have proven reliable in determining the immediate risk posed by each vulnerability.

NorthStar's vulnerability prediction engine is a yes/no categorical prediction. This provides a definitive assessment on whether a CVE will eventually be exploited in the wild. Each prediction comes with a timestamp representing when the prediction was first made based on all available data at the time.

WHY NORTHSTAR?
Sometimes in life, it's the small decisions that create the biggest impact. Just because a CVE has an exploit, it does not mean it has ever been used in the wild. Don't get stuck relying on an exploit probability score that leaves you questioning where to draw the line.
NorthStar predicts the application of exploit to a CVE and our results are validated by industry leading threat intelligence feeds.

NorthStar leverages active attacker tool imagery and all available vulnerability data to predict if an exploit will be created and used in the wild for a particular vulnerability. In the examples above, NorthStar predicted CVE-2019-11510 386 days in advance and CVE-2020-15505 47 days in advance of either being exploited in the wild.
Confidently anticipate future exploits with a definite YES from NorthStar Prediction Engine.
