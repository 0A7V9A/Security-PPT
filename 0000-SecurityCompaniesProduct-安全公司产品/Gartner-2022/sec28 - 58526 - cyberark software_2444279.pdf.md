Privileged Access -- a Real, Pervasive, Threat
Attackers are wreaking havoc across the globe with advanced cyber attacks that directly target the most valuable assets of an enterprise. Modern organizations are digitally transforming their businesses with cloud first strategies, increasing consumption of SaaS applications and implementing DevOps methodologies. While critical for business productivity, these initiatives widen the attack surface by creating additional human and machine identities that can gain privileged access under certain conditions, establishing new pathways for attackers to target. Forrester estimates that 80 percent of security breaches involve privileged credentials.1 Once attackers get in, they seek access to an organization's most sensitive data with the intent to cause costly harm. The compromise of privileged identities can lead to damaged reputations, financial losses, and stolen intellectual property. Malicious insiders within an organization can also divulge sensitive information to the public or plant seeds to cause internal damage.
Privileged identities and the accounts they use to access critical resources represent one of the largest security risks an organization faces today. Privileged identities continue to grow across organizations, and privileged access is provisioned to employees and external vendors in all departments, not just IT administrators. Under certain circumstances, every member of the workforce (employees and vendors), and/or machine identity can become a privileged user and ultimately gain access to sensitive business applications, systems and internal resources. It's clear that privileged identities are top targets for attackers. Here's a few reasons why:
· Privileged accounts and credentials exist in nearly every networked device, database, application and server on-premises, in
the cloud and throughout the DevOps pipeline
· Privileged accounts used by both human users and non-human/machine identities have all-powerful access to confidential
data and systems
· Privileged accounts have shared administrative access, making their users anonymous · Privileged accounts grant sweeping access, far beyond what is needed for the everyday user to perform their job function. It is
especially challenging to restrict unnecessary privileges on endpoints and in the cloud.
· Privileged accounts go unmonitored and unreported ­ and therefore unsecured
Privilege must be secured wherever it exists, whether in explicitly labeled privileged accounts or for accounts used by workforce or machine identities that have select access to sensitive information. Anyone, or anything, in possession of a privileged account could control an organization's resources, disable security systems and access vast amounts of sensitive data. As IT infrastructures grow more dynamic and spreads across hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, all predictions point to privilege misuse worsening in the future unless organizations take action now.
Best practices dictate that organizations should incorporate securing all identities ­ particularly those with explicit privileged access ­ into the core of their security strategy. Managing and Securing privileged access is an enterprise-wide security challenge that requires consistent controls to protect, monitor, detect, alert and respond to all privileged activity that presents material risk.
Privileged Credentials ­ The Keys to the IT Kingdom
Privileged credentials are the keys to the IT kingdom. They are required to unlock privileged accounts and they are sought out by external attackers and malicious insiders as the primary way to gain direct access to the heart of the enterprise. As such, an organization's critical systems and sensitive data are only as secure as the privileged credentials required to access these assets.
Most organizations today rely on a mix of privileged credentials such as passwords, API keys, certificates, tokens and SSH keys to authenticate users and systems to privileged accounts. All of these credential types must be securely stored and rotated. All use of

CYBERARK WHITE PAPER

credentials should be additionally authenticated for each use with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). If left unsecured, attackers can compromise these valuable secrets and credentials to gain possession of privileged accounts and advance attacks or use them to exfiltrate data. As some organizations begin to protect passwords, attackers, in their constant journey to find the path of least resistance, have shifted their attack methods to SSH keys, which are often overlooked.
Organizations must adopt a privileged access management (PAM) strategy that includes proactive protection and monitoring of all privileged secrets and credentials.
The Trusted Advisor in Privileged Access Management
CyberArk is the leading Identity Security provider and recognized creator of the PAM market. Built on a foundation of securing privilege, and powered by Artificial Intelligence-based behavior and risk analytics, the CyberArk Identity Security Platform helps organizations secure access to critical business data and infrastructure, protect a distributed workforce, and accelerate business in the cloud.
CyberArk's Identity Security Platform is built on the pillars of management for Access, Privilege, and DevSecOps to deliver authentication, authorization, access, and audit in an integrated, seamless manner--enabling security at every step in the Identity Security lifecycle. Our intelligent approach balances the need for better security with end user productivity. CyberArk solutions leverage real-time intelligence and analytics to create a context-based, adaptive approach to the Identity Security lifecycle ­ for all identities, across all systems and apps, using any device. To mitigate the risk of a serious breach, enterprises need to adopt a security solution with consistent controls that specifically address their privileged access exposure.
Are You Underestimating Your Level of Risk?
In our CyberArk Threat Landscape 2019 Report2, we discovered that 84% of IT security professionals recognized that infrastructure and critical data are not fully protected unless privileged accounts, credentials and secrets are secured and protected. If not properly secured, infrastructure and data can be easily fall prey to popular attack methods like malware, DDoS and brute force attacks. Yet, many organizations indicate that their organization has not done enough to protect themselves against malware and advanced attacks: fewer than 40% of respondents indicated that their organization had implemented strict access policies for users with access to critical infrastructure and applications. Malware requires admin access to gain persistence; privileged access without vigilant management creates an ever-growing attack surface around privileged accounts.
Additionally, DevOps security has not yet reached the necessary maturity levels of traditional enterprise IT: only 35% of respondents belong to organizations that have implemented a PAM security strategy for cloud or DevOps. Perhaps even more surprising is the revelation that only 46% of organizations have a strategy in place for protecting their mission critical servers-- the compromise of which would represent a total loss of control of the network to a hacker. When you consider the massive risks associated with the typical enterprise coupled with a general lack of strong privileged security measures across many organizations--and then face the reality that the majority of security breaches executed in the last 10 years have involved the abuse of privileged access--it becomes very clear where IT security professionals need to have a focused plan of attack.
Compliance: To Meet or Not to Meet
As the risk of advanced threats increases, compliance regulations, standards and frameworks such as PCI DSS, SOX, NIST, NERCCIP, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA and SWIFT CSCF, have increased their requirements to control, manage and monitor privileged access.
Organizations that do not fully understand their privileged landscape face the prospect of audit failure resulting in steep fines and penalties and more importantly, remaining vulnerable to a serious breach without a PAM strategy.

Who Are Your Privileged Users?
Enterprises tend to overlook the vast array of identities with access to privileged information. The truth is that there are not enough policies set to ensure that privileged identities have only the right level of access to the systems and information they actually need to perform their jobs. This results in anonymous, unchecked access to privileged accounts and sensitive information which leaves the enterprise open to potential compromise that could cripple an organization.
External vendors. Nowadays, every organization relies on a network of trusted third-party vendors to complete critical business tasks and maintain business operations. Due to the complexities of managing and provisioning access to workers that are not a part of the organization, privileged access is often granted to perform a job function allowing contractors to work under a cloak of anonymity. Once inside, remote vendors have unrestricted access similar to any "standard" privileged user and can elevate privileges to access sensitive data throughout the organization.
Cloud administrators and shadow admins. Business processes, such as finance, HR, and procurement, are increasingly moving critical workloads to the public cloud. The human and machine identities with access to these workloads must be protected and continuously reviewed to implement least privilege access.
Systems administrators. For almost every device in an IT environment (every endpoint and server), there are shared and built-in privileged accounts with elevated privileges and unfettered access to its operating systems, networks, servers, and databases.
Application or database administrators. Application and database administrators are granted broad access to administer the systems to which they are assigned. This access allows them to also connect with virtually any other database or application found in the enterprise.
Business users. Senior-level executives and IT personnel with sensitive information have long been targets of cyber attacks. But as organizations grow their footprint, enable a remote workforce and store more of their sensitive business data in cloud services and applications, the lines between traditionally privileged users and the workforce have blurred. Traditionally non-privileged users now often require selective privileged access to cloud-hosted resources or sensitive records within SaaS applications. This privileged access can't be overlooked. In the hands of the wrong person, business user credentials could put sensitive information like corporate financial data and intellectual property at risk.
End users. Far too many companies *still* allow their end users to run with local admin access to do menial things like install software and setup a printer. Any IAM user with access to their organization's public cloud workspaces can be provisioned with thousands of permissions, opening the door to major misconfigurations. In the hands of the wrong person, end user privileged credentials provide the first place for incoming attackers to persist as they begin their journey toward corporate financial data, intellectual property, and other sensitive data.
Social media. Privileged access is granted to administer the corporate internal and external social networks. Employees and contractors are granted privileged access to write to those social media accounts. Misuse of these credentials can lead to a public takeover causing harm for an organization's brand or an executive's reputation.
Applications. Applications use privileged accounts to communicate with other applications, scripts, databases, web services and more. These accounts are often overlooked and pose significant risk, as their credentials are often hardcoded and static. A hacker can use these credentials as attack points to escalate privileged access throughout the organization.

DevOps. DevOps pipelines enable organizations to achieve high levels of agility by automatically building and deploying services and applications. To access data and other applications and services, these services require secrets and other credentials which must be secured. Additionally, a typical DevOps pipeline is supported by several powerful tools, each of which is managed by an admin console which is accessed using privileged credentials which must also be protected.

Policy First: Aligning Risk Management with Business Objectives
Best practices dictate that organizations create, implement, and enforce PAM policies to reduce the risk of a serious breach. Effective enterprise security and compliance begins with well executed business policy. A policy first approach ensures that the exposure to external threats, insider threats and privilege misuse is reduced and the organization can meet strict government and industry compliance regulations.

CYBERARK® SECRETS MANAGER

THE CHALLENGE
Enterprises are increasingly adopting DevOps methodologies and automation to improve business agility while also leveraging commercial and internally developed applications. However, each application, automation tool and other non-human identity relies on some form of privileged credential to access sensitive resources. Application and IT environments can vary significantly within the same organization -- from highly dynamic, cloud native to largely static and even mainframe based. The credentials used by applications need to be secured regardless of the application type and compute environment. Securing these credentials poses challenges for IT security, operations, and compliance teams:
· Application and other non-human credentials are widespread ­ they include
embedded hard-coded credentials in business-critical applications including internally developed and commercial off-the- shelf solutions (COTS), security software such as vulnerability scanners, application servers, IT management software, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platforms, and the CI/CD tool chain.
· Application and other non-human credentials need to be managed
­ in addition to eliminating hard-coded credentials in code and scripts, recommended approaches and techniques including strong authentication, least privilege, role-based access controls, credential rotation, and audit.
· Automated processes are incredibly powerful ­ they can access protected
data, scale at unparalleled rates, leverage cloud resources, and rapidly execute business processes to drive tremendous value. However, as well-publicized security breaches demonstrate, automated processes are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, which can occur suddenly and spread rapidly.
Businesses must protect privileged credentials assigned to non-human identities to defend against attacks. Additionally, these credentials are typically assigned and managed by people such as IT admins, developers and DevOps admins. Consequently, it is critical that human access to admin consoles are also consistently managed and secured across the enterprise.

KEY BENEFITS

CYBERARK DATA SHEET

· For securing commercial off-the-shelf solutions ­ Credential Providers can
rotate and manage the credentials that third-party tools and solutions such as security tools, RPA, automation tools, IT management, etc. need to complete their jobs. For example, a vulnerability scanner typically needs high levels of privilege to scan systems across the enterprise's infrastructure. Instead of storing privilege credentials in COTS solutions, they are managed by CyberArk. To simplify how enterprises allow third party solutions to access privileged credentials, CyberArk offers the most validated COTS integrations for solving identity security challenges.
· For internally-developed traditional applications ­ Credential Providers can
protect business-system data and simplify operations by eliminating hard-coded credentials from internally developed applications. The solution provides a comprehensive set of features for managing application passwords and SSH keys, and supports a broad range of application environments, including application servers, Java, .Net, and scripting running on a variety of platforms and operating systems including Unix/Linux, Windows and zOS.
Secrets Manager provides robust enterprise-grade capabilities and integrates with existing systems to help organizations protect and extend established security models and practices.
CAPABILITIES
The Secrets Manager solutions are designed to help organizations:
· Establish strong authentication ­ by leveraging the native attributes of
applications, containers, and other non-human identities to eliminate the "secret zero bootstrapping" challenge and potential vulnerability.
· Manage and rotate secrets ­ by leveraging dual accounts and other techniques. · Simplify integrations ­ by supporting validated integrations with CI/CD toolsets,
and container platforms, and a wide range of commercial software platforms, applications and tools, such as business applications, security tools and RPA.
· Accelerate deployment and usage ­ by providing developers with easy to-use
solutions to secure secrets in application and DevOps environments.
· Ensure a comprehensive audit on any access ­ by tracking all access and
providing tamper-resistant audit.
· Consistently apply access policies ­ by applying role-based access controls on
non-human identities, leveraging integrations with other CyberArk and partner solutions to centralize policy management across the enterprise.
· Ensure business continuity and other enterprise requirements ­ including
scalability, availability, redundancy and resiliency.
· Flexible deployment options ­ Secrets Manager supports both SaaS and on-prem
versions of the CyberArk Vault to simplify deployments and increase flexibility, while also strengthening security by centrally managing credentials and secrets across the enterprise.
