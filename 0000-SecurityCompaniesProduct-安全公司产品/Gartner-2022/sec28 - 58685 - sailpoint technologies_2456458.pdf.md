Welcome to the core
 of Identity Security.
C Today's modern enterprise faces change on multiple fronts: Anywhere operations. loud,
in all its forms. Digital transformation. IoT devices. The list goes on. These changes have the power to elevate your business, but they come with unprecedented security challenges.
According to a recent IDSA report, 94% of security breaches today are identity related.1
Enterprise security starts and ends with identities, yet the ability to manage and secure identities in the modern environment has moved well beyond human capacity. Identities connect to upwards of billions of technology access points, all with varying levels of access requirements that evolve as the needs of the business change. And each access point represents a potential security exposure if not properly managed and secured. 


A peripheral, one-size-fits-all security product simply won't cut it. You need a solution that goes to the core.

At the core of Identity Security is artificial intelligence and machine learning. A foundation that protects your organization against cyber threats by automating the discovery, management, and control of ALL user access. It ensures that each identity, human or nonhuman, has the access needed to do their job ­ no more, no less ­ and that access is automatically adjusted as their role changes or if they leave the organization. It can also spot risky user behaviors, detecting and preventing toxic access combinations that could lead to potential fraud or data theft.

At the core of Identity Security is automation that streamlines identity processes and decisions such as access requests, role modeling, and access certifications, driving greater efficiencies across your organization. It facilitates defining user roles and creating policies to govern access throughout the lifecycle of every digital identity that makes up today's workforce. It puts an emphasis on enablement, security, and compliance, which means not only providing access but also properly controlling that access. The core of Identity Security pays the ultimate dividend: freeing your workers to focus on innovation, collaboration, and productivity, while reducing risk and improving total cost of ownership.

At the core of Identity Security is seamless integration with your digital ecosystem, extending your ability to embed identity context across your environment and centrally control access to all data, applications, systems, and cloud infrastructure for all identity types. No matter how complex your business environment or where it operates -- in the cloud, on premises, or hybrid -- a complete, core Identity Security solution meets you where you are. Always secure. Always compliant.
