THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
Digital transformation has led to an explosion of new technologies, connected devices and computing platforms. From IT to Cloud to IoT to OT, this complex computing landscape is the modern cyber attack surface. The tools and processes of yesterday are being used to solve today's problems ­ built and designed for the old era of IT when the cyber attack surface was a static laptop, desktop or on-premises server. As a result, organizations struggle at every step ­ seeing their assets, detecting weaknesses, prioritizing issues for remediation, measuring risk, and comparing to peers ­ preventing them from confidently managing and reducing cyber risk. The digital era requires a new approach.
We are the first and only provider of Cyber Exposure solutions. We work with more than 30,000 organizations around the world to help them manage and measure cybersecurity risk in the digital era. We are building on our deep technology expertise as a pioneer in the vulnerability assessment and management market, providing broad visibility across the modern attack surface and deep insights to help security teams, executives and boards of directors prioritize and measure Cyber Exposure.
