SEAMLESS INTEGRATION
COMPREHENSIVE ASSET INVENTORY

"There has never been a tool
that does what Axonius does, allowing us to tie everything together using simple queries and then putting compliance on autopilot. -- JEFFREY GARDNER
SENIOR DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SECURITY, LANDMARK HEALTH
How it works.
DEPLOY AXONIUS
Axonius is an agentless single virtual appliance and can be deployed either on- premise or in cloud instances.
CONNECT ADAPTERS
Connect to the different solutions you already use with Adapters, pre-built integrations on the Axonius platform.
EXAMINE YOUR ASSETS
Axonius provides a fully unique list of devices and users so you can surface areas of risk and be alerted when policies aren't met.

Key Benefits
REDUCE MEAN TIME TO INVENTORY
Axonius correlates data from all sources to provide an up-to-date inventory of all unique assets. This single source of truth gives security teams a clear, consistent picture of their asset inventory without the need for constant manual audits.

AUTOMATE SECURITY POLICY ENFORCEMENT
The Axonius Security Policy Enforcement Center addresses assets that don't adhere to your security policies. Security enforcement sets can be customized for any condition to notify personnel, enrich data, or remediate incidents automatically.

SEAMLESS DEPLOYMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Axonius is agentless -- no endpoint or network agent is needed. Even customers with more than a million devices and more than 50,000 employees still deploy Axonius as a single virtual appliance to get complete visibility into their assets.

THE CHALLENGE OF SaaS.

SaaS has benefitted all types of businesses, but the sprawl and interconnectivity of applications has become unwieldy. A typical company may have a CRM that is connected to company collaboration tools, an HR management platform that handles sensitive data and has integrations with many other platforms, and many more.
Compounding this challenge, 97% of SaaS apps are unmanaged making it very difficult for IT, security, and finance teams to reduce security risk, manage SaaS licenses, and manage costs.
