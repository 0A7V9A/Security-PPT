STRUCTURED IDENTITY® 1.0
The Affordable, Enterprise-Grade Identity Management Solution Made for Small to Medium Sized Institutions
A Full Featured, Best Practice, Out of the Box Identity Solution
We understand the challenge of deploying Identity. Time consuming discovery, arguments, politics, and budget constraints. That is why we built STRUCTURED IDENTITY. It's an end-to-end, pre-built solution that lays the foundation for your Identity Core and the future of your organization.
The Identity Core is essential to the success of your identity program. Automatic exports from your source of authority, determining Identity type, evaluating every user against core Student, Faculty, Staff, Alumni and Applicant policies, automatically provisioning them, automatically notifying them with onboarding instructions, providing a secure and extensible (self-service) Identity claiming process that includes mobile device registration and multi-factor enablement and enforcement is the core of every Identity solution. And, STRUCTURED IDENTITY is that core.
We've designed the most efficient, focused and right-sized solution that empowers you to configure a working solution with the agility to adapt to your business.
STRUCTURED IDENTITY provides you with:  A structured data model to help you clean up your unstructured source data  A role-based access control structure for Students, Faculty, Staff, Alumni and Applicants  Automated life cycle provisioning/de-provisioning for Active Directory, Office 365, Google (G-Suite), Blackboard or Canvas  A hardened governance & security policy structure for your service desk employees to ensure separation of duty  Out of the Box multi-factor authentication via Microsoft/Google Authenticator (TOTP)
Note: If you currently use Duo, we will integrate Duo into your life cycle processes for accessing Fischer Identity's self-service IAM portal. We've also included automated provisioning of your Duo accounts so you don't have to manually add users anymore.
 Identity claiming process for self-service onboarding of your identities  Password management solution, including self-service based password reset (with MFA) and
also includes NIST recommended password policies to provide for ultimate security  An affordable strategy to move your identity program to the cloud

Yes, you read that right, the first day we engage with you, you will have a functioning automated life cycle management solution in your test environment. We can then have you ready for production in less than 30 days, putting you in control of your migration timeline!
STRUCTURED IDENTITY is an out of the box solution that enables a 30-40% reduction in implementation time to production as opposed to the traditional time consuming IGA discovery process that is too long and too expensive in both time and money.
STRUCTURED IDENTITY is the first step to finding the time needed to expand your vision for your identity program.

Time is money, but money is money too. STRUCTURED IDENTITY provides savings in implementation time but it also saves your budget by realizing savings of more than $30,000. We are proud to provide, to our partners, an affordable, enterprise-grade lifecycle management solution.
