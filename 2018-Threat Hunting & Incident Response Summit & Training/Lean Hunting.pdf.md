Abstract
Lean Hunting
(Threat) Hunting has been around long enough that most agree it should be part of all comprehensive information security programs. In any cat and mouse game, existing traps will never catch all mice. We need to apply creativity, analytical thinking, and keep humans in the loop. The challenge, of course, is that human hours are scarce and expensive. Most organizations cannot afford to staff hunt teams 24/7 (or at all), so what's the best way to deploy human attention to identify emerging threats? We'll explore how to adopt aspects of entrepreneurship and align organizations to achieve positive outcomes by building lean (threat) hunting capabilities.

Lean Manufacturing
· Developed by Toyota 70s/80s, perhaps 30s! · Systematic, holistic identification of waste · Improves the flow / smoothness of work · Just-In-Time and Autonomation (smart
automation) · Identify features, process, inputs that create
customer value, everything else is waste
@chicagoben | @obsidiansec

Lean Manufacturing

Eight types of waste require monitoring:
1. Overproduction ­ Is supply way higher than demand? 2. Waiting ­ Lag time between production steps 3. Inventory (work in progress) ­ Are supply levels and work in
progress inventories too high? 4. Transportation ­ Do you move materials efficiently? 5. Over-processing ­ Do you work on the product too many times? 6. Motion ­ Do people and things move between tasks efficiently? 7. Defects ­ How much time do you spend finding, fixing mistakes? 8. Workforce ­ Do you use workers efficiently?

Waste:  anything that doesn't add value to the end product

Essentialism?
"It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential."

Lean Startup Methodology

"The Lean Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup - how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere - and grow a business with maximum acceleration."  - Eric Ries

Lean methodology: ·Gets products and services
in the hands of customers f a s t e r. ·Reduces uncertainty (and waste)!

Wait ... OODA LOOPS!
"Time is the dominant parameter.  The pilot who goes through the OODA cycle in the shortest time prevails because his opponent is caught responding to situations that have already changed."

Minimum Viable Product.

Minimum viable product: The skinniest
version of a product that still functions. · sufficient functionality to attract initial users/customers · promises enough future benefit to keep early adopters · designed with a feedback loop to guide new features

We aren't selling anything.

You're always selling!

People

Can you sell your organization on new spending? Can you sell your organization on freeing up time to hunt? Can you sell the culture on spending time to help with hunting?

Risk as a Slope

Risk

Catch points descending the risk slope.

Threat Threshold Impact Zone

The steeper the risk slope, the faster the environment slides into compromise.

Right-Size Surface Area?
Visualize the surface area you could use against the surface area you are using. Lower the risk and also focus your hunts!
@chicagoben | @obsidiansec

Dormant Accounts?
Aside from risk, cost savings could be huge!
At left, a relatively small company (600 employees) could save over $300k / year by right-sizing 3 services!

Information Security and the Cloud

"IT is going from 0 to 100 in the cloud and leaving us in the dust"
- CISO, Financial Tech Company
"50% of our IR Engagements are Office 365."
- Principal IR, Rapid7

"We're blind to all these new SaaS accounts"
- Director, Cyber Intelligence,  Top Athletics Brand
"We have 300 AWS accounts and no governance"
- Public Tech Company

"Hackers don't break in, they login." - CISO, Cisco

@chicagoben | @obsidiansec

Remember: Reduce Waste & Essentialism
Where's the IT waste? (Dormant Accounts, Config Drift, etc) Where can you get the biggest ROI of your Hunting time? Identify features, process, inputs that create successful hunts... everything else is waste (or could be)!
@chicagoben | @obsidiansec

Remember: Build. Measure. Learn.
