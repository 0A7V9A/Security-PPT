Requirements for CSIRT in Organization in Malaysia

In 2013, the National Security Council of
Malaysia (NSC) released the guideline "NSC Directive 24: National Cyber Crisis
Management Mechanism."

This directive specifies the requirement for all government agencies to establish their
own CSIRT as one of the initiatives to manage cyber incidents

In 2013, the latest version of the ISMS standard (27001:2013(E)) contains three additional sub clauses under paragraph A16.1, which emphasize on response and assessment of information security incidents:

1. A 16.1.5 Response to information security incidents
2. A 16.1.6 Learning from information security incidents
3. A 16.1.7 Collection of evidence

Location Campaign Started Campaign Ended Malware Name Malware Severity

: University Campus : April 2018 : May 2018 : Carberp : High

Malware Description: This family of Trojans can steal online banking credentials as well as usernames and passwords from applications. The malware also has the capability to download other malware and steal sensitive information by taking screenshots or recording keyboard strokes.

Analysis of Result: ·Some of Carberp malware variants are not only targeting for Microsoft Windows (PC) but for Android (Mobile Phone); which is outside the scope of this pilot project ·Lack of users awareness on the campaign, thus unable to clean the Carberp malware
36

Conclusion
1. Our strategy to cope with emerging new threats is by adopting a holistic approach ­ people, process and technology
2. We need to be prepared all the times by enhancing: a. Information sharing amongst relevant stakeholders b. Cyber incidents response and coordination c. Collaborative & innovative research d. Capacity building and education e. Acculturation and outreach program
