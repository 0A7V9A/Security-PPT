Case Study - The "Lone Wolf" Wave of Attacks - 2015
A wave of knife and ramming attacks starting in 2015 after an incitement campaign in Social Media (Facebook) Inciting content becomes viral, affects mainly teenagers Actors are unknown to the security forces of Israel Traditional intelligence gathering is useless Large amounts of data to process Low "Noise" ratio is a must High level linguistic capability is required

Case Study - The "Lone Wolf" Wave Attacks - 2015

Summary
OSINT has become an essential part of contemporary business and national security intelligence requirements, specifically cyber security The exponential growth in complexity and scale of data created numerous challenges for fulfilling OSINT potential AI advancements provide answers to many of the challenges in collecting and analyzing vast amount of data to create timely and actionable insights AI is going to transform both the way we create, share and consume data, and the way we create intelligence Harnessing advancements in AI to augment existing OSINT platforms and analysts will give an edge over competitors and adversaries
