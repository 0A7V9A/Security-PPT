2. THREATENS THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF COMPANIES AND DISQUALIFYING AND PROHIBITING PROVIDERS TO MANAGE A PORTAL OF SERVICES OR A PLATFORM OF OPERATIONS BY MEANS OF SANCTIONS EQUAL TO 4 % OF THE REVENUE.

WHY GDPR ?
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/National_accounts_and_GDP
2008 Third crisis after 1987 and 2001 !
In 2017, the GDP in the EU amounted to around 15.33 trillion euros.

The latest major invention in "Services" is the "financial instruments" creation in 1982 which multiplied by 10,000 outstanding transactions (Derivative Markets) and by 100 losses "termination" because of insufficient controls!

 THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF HUMAN ORGANIZATION FOR 50 YEARS
In aviation, the challenge of the sound barrier lasted 54 years. 20 years to exceed 200 km / h in 1913, the Wright brothers.
54 years old to overcome the Sound Barrier in 1947: Chuck Yeager Bell 1126 km / h
In digital communication, the challenge is even faster: probably 12 years Current competitors are followers: They have not yet taken up the challenge of the
"Digital Barrier" to meet the GDPR Regulation.
The economic consequences of this profound IT reform are incalculable and will reverberate around the world:
With GDPR, the « DIGITAL BARRIER » will be overcome in few years !
The number of "qualified" Operators (Processors), "qualified " Companies (Controllers responsible of Trust Services), "qualified "Chartered Control Bodies" (Marketplaces) including "certified" Management Software Publishers, will decrease by 65%. The segmentation of "Regulatory Processes" in the banking sector has already experienced a reduction in the number of banking licenses in Europe above 65%. Documentary digitization will reduce management costs by  700 billion and the risks by 80% (European Commission SSEDIC DG Connect 2012) Data qualification optimizes decision support and certification systems through analysis and artificial intelligence : PwC in its study "Sizing the prize", estimates that global GDP could grow by 14% by 2030 thanks to artificial intelligence. The AI is expected to contribute $ 15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current cumulative GDP of China and India.

why so much severity?

Operators-Banking networks are also concerned by the GDPR as Operators-

Commercial or Documentary networks

Notional amount of derivatives "over the counter"

GDPR streamlines all international regulations,
especially to avoid unbearable banking cracks:
Bâle 1,Ratio Cook , Solvency Ratio, MIFID II (Organising Trading Facilities), EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation), FATCA II-(Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), BALE 3 (Liquidity Coverage Ratio, NSFR Net Stable Funding Ratio 2019), RUBIK (bank secrecy), SOLVENCY 2 (ratios MCR & SCR), AIMFD (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive), PSD2 Payment, Reference COBiT 5: Governance standards including, TOGAF, PMBOK, Prince2, COSO, ISO 20000, ISO 27001, ITIL, PCI DSS, Sarbanes-Oxley/IFRS.

10 times the real economy

600,000 billion euros

For rotten products, the US Court ordered Goldman Sachs to pay $ 5 billion, JPMorgan $ 13 billion and Bank of America $ 16.6 billion.

400,000 billion euros 200,000 billion euros

Deutsche Bank its balance sheet1600 billion euros, equivalent to half or 50 % of Germany's GDP, and one-tenth of the GDP of the European Union
US justice has claimed $ 14 billion from Deutsche Bank (12.5 billion euros) for the 2007 subprime scandal that led to the 2008 financial crisis. currently in 8000 legal proceedings in the world!

Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) 360 billion euros of bad World gross domestic productloans (of which 210 billion would be partly irrecoverable), or
20% of Italy's GDP.

FUTURE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IMPACT OF DIGITIZATION
"By 2030, financial services will be completely transformed requiring substantial steps to be taken today by the
industry, new entrants and regulators to ensure a positive outcome of the transformation. If unchecked, the impact of these forces on client choice, the range of providers and the level of risk in the system is going to be dramatic, resulting in a financial system dominated by a few large fintech players fuelled by their power of data aggregation relatively unencumbered by the current levels of regulation plus a handful of today's incumbents.

Mandatory Security Leverage Application

The GDPR and e.IDAS Regulations establish a "first level "of IT security (Access, Confidentiality) and legal security (Evidence Value) for exchanges

between users of the same operator-processor using a "qualified signature".

In 4 cases, the security level should be about 5 times higher by adding:

1. A "code of conduct" with "appropriate s guarantees" and "control mechanisms "carried out by an approved and "Independent supervisory body".
2. "Appropriate technical and organizational means "and certified by an independent "conformity assessment body."

SERVICES CONTROLLER

OPERATIONS

PROCESSOR

« QUALIFIED SIGNATURES »

V

The 4 cases are:
1. The processor-operator uses an "advanced signature "instead of a "qualified signature "for each signatory. 2. The processor operator communicates (trusted interoperability) with another processor operator. 3. The processor-operator processes the "data of several related companies." 4. The processor-operator "transfers " "personal data outside Europe".

Trinary or Ternary System

The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. William Hinman, the agency's director of the
division of corporate finance, said
"Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network, and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions," Hinman said at Yahoo's All Market Summit: Crypto in San Francisco.

Joe Lubin, a cofounder of Ethereum and the founder of CosenSys, a major Ethereum application company, says he is grateful for the SEC's decision. "We applaud the clarity provided by Director Hinman and the SEC today,"

Benefits

Real-time. Internal IT.
Speed, cost and (relative) simplicity.

Limitations

Committing transactions with third parties/across network.

Independent (but enabled by messaging).
Up to 3-5 days. External provider + settlement cost. Secure transaction between external parties, standardized data format.
Data errors slow transactions, flexibility.

Via clearing house.
Days, transaction dependent. Third-party service.

Consensus
(Proof of stake or proof of work).
Near real-time to minutes.
Similar to internal database.

Trusted relations and credentials management to establish
consensus. PROOF OF TRUST
Real-time.
Marginal with respect to current operational cost.

Reduced settlement risk/DVP.
Complex and cumbersome, expensive.

Enables third-party transaction to be as simple and efficient as internal transactions.
Technology maturity, integration with existing systems/workflows, consensus not controlled by independent body, difficult to manage revocation, relies on the absence of trust between parties.

By design compliance with GDPR, eIDAS and NIS regulations. Signature integrity, signature consent, electronic seal. Seamless integration with existing systems/workflows. Modularity and full interoperability. Real-time management of revocation lists and traceability.
Need for strong enrolment to enable multi-factor authentication.

CONCLUSION:

FROM FEAR TO TRUST

3 POSSIBLE SCENARII FOR CYBERSECURITY FUTURE

Cyberdigital Prehistory
 no anticipation of cyber risk
 little or no collaboration between economic actors
=
 cyber criminal domination
 impact on growth and trust
Loss of trust

Cyberdigital Middle Age
 knowledge of a cyber threat, investments
 few collective rules in force, few alliances
 a shy defense culture
=
 risk of cyber disaster restraint but not null
 risk amplified in a future "everything and all connected"
54

Cyberdigital Renaissance
 massive collaboration of private and public actors
 "White net": more agile defense and prospective vision
