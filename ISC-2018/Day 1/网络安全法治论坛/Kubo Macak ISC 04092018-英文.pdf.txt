INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBERSPACE: PRE-HISTORY
Early fantasies of cyberspace as a terra nullius, a sovereignty-free zone
Deep and persistent lack of understanding of cyber security by decision-makers
Slow awakening to the fact of applicability of international law in cyberspace

INTERNATIONAL CYBER LAW: CURRENT LEGAL LANDSCAPE

Existing generally applicable rules
· ICJ's Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion
· General consensus of States that IL applies
· UN GGE process

Sectoral and regional treaties
· 2001 CoE's Convention on Cybercrime
· 2009 SCO's Information Security Agreement
· 2014 African Union's Cyber Security Convention

Non-State initiatives

CYBERSPACE GOVERNANCE: COMPETING APPROACHES*

Western position: "multistakeholderism"
· A model that gives "all appropriate stakeholders in the Internet the ability to participate in its evolution" (United States, 2013)
· Stakeholders include gov'ts, int'l organizations, NGOs, industry, academia, individuals...
· Stakeholders meet in a wide variety of fora, including ICANN, IGF, GCCS, GCSC...
*) Huang and Macák (2017)

Chinese position: "multilateralism"
· Aim to establish "a multilateral, democratic and transparent international Internet governance system" (China, Five-Year Plan for 2016­2020)
· Multilateral model is topdown, State-centric, and coordinated
· The primary forum for the multilateral model is the United Nations

Signs of convergence
· Verbal affirmations from both sides that the two models are not mutually exclusive
· Confirmation of the role of the private sector and civil society in the UN GGE process
· Coexistence of different conceptions of cyber governance

NORM-MAKING LABORATORIES
"ONLY STATES MAKE INTERNATIONAL LAW" (E.G. SCHMITT 2010)...
...BUT EVEN STATES CAN "GET BY WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM [THEIR] FRIENDS"
(LENNON & MCCARTNEY 1967)...
...SO, NON-STATE INITIATIVES MAY SERVE AS NORMMAKING LABORATORIES (MACÁK 2017): · INTERMEDIATE STAGE · PROCESS INCLUSIVITY · DEPEND ON STATE REACTION

THE ROAD AHEAD
