GDPR Enforcement and Its International Influence
The Politics of Data Regulation

Rogier Creemers



THIS PRESENTATION WILL NOT DISCUSS...
Specific requirements for data protection included in GDPR
Specific forms of liability and potential sanctions
Compliance measures for businesses and other data controllers

THIS PRESENTATION WILL DISCUSS:
 How GDPR is embedded within the EU's regulatory culture
 How GDPR reflects particular EU concerns about the digital economy and digital democracy
 What this means for the enforcement of GDPR norms within Europe
 How this might influence non-EU actors

EU REGULATORY CULTURE
 Pursuit of human dignity --Data: influenced by the legacy of World War 2
 The Internal Market as core project  Balancing of consumer interests with corporate interests
--Particularly given the growing importance of the European Parliament  Culture of regulatory excellence ("Brussels effect")

THE DATA PROBLEM
 Data concerns mix political and economic concerns, and are often framed in the language of fundamental rights.
--Economic: prevalence of US businesses, increasing power of data brokers
--Political: potential harm to the functioning of democratic system (Brexit)  Consequence: GDPR aims for balance between power of users
and data controllers, and limits particular forms of data use.

ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE
 GDPR sanctions provisions appear fearsome, but: --Enforcement landscape is fragmented between national
regulators --These are often underfunded and underresourced --There is hope that GDPR itself will already create a certain
deterrent effect --Many provisions remain to be tested in practice, and are
subject to technological development  Consequently, GDPR enforcement must not only be seen in light
of its text, but in the priorities of enforcement bodies.

INTERNATIONAL IMPACT
 "Brussels effect": it is hoped that GDPR will become a de facto global best practice
 GDPR has already informed data protection laws elsewhere (including China)
 What with "de minimis" data use in the EU?  How far does Brussels' arm reach?
