No Privacy without Security

Privacy

Security

GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR) FINES 20M EUROS OR 4% WORLDWIDE REVENUE
RANSOMWARE DAMAGE COSTS PREDICTED TO HIT $11.5B BY 2019 (SOURCE CYBERSECURITY VENTURES)
CLOUD IS THE FOCAL POINT FOR THE FUTURE OF IT AND THE MECHANISM FOR DELIVERING SECURITY AND PRIVACY

Overheard Everywhere
BE AWARE OF YOUR CLOUD USAGE BUILD STRATEGIES FOR SECURING CLOUD
BE OPPORTUNISTIC TO IDENTIFY CLOUD SOLUTIONS TO ADVANCE THE STRATEGY ("CLOUD FIRST")
BE AGILE AND TRANSFORM SECURITY AND PRIVACY
EVERYONE IS MULTI-CLOUD

Enterprise-Grade Cloud Security

· Continuous Encryption: reduce the "plaintext" window of exposure
· Identify Mgt beyond the human to all entities
· Software Defined Perimeter
· DevSecOps automates the Cloud-Native Security
· AI/Machine learning to scale up

Secure Perimeter
Micro-perimeter -- isolating applications and data with a hardened configuration immune to attack Strong abstraction layer from hardware and VM environment
Restricted visibility into computing environment
Discrete and limited perimeter which can be subjected to effective monitoring Continuous Encryption
Encryption of data at rest
Encryption of data in transit Secure key management-- ­ leveraging PKI for transaction functions

Continuous Monitoring Reachable attachment points for monitoring capabilities through comprehensive APIs
Robust monitoring data availability
Easy integration of third party monitoring capabilities
Res ilient Operations
Capable of withstanding attack
Minimal degradation of performance as a result of environmental failures Continuous function in the presence of a ongoing attack
Highly Granular Access Control
Capable highly granular resource allocation

Ready Incident Res ponse

Strong cryptographic identity management

Hybrid automation and manual response

Ubiquitous ­ users, administrators, applications, data

Identity Infrastructure

Visibility of configurations Auditable evidence

Governance, Risk Management, Compliance Readily identify gaps or other weaknesses Broad regulatory and compliance certifications

Final thoughts
Building the Global Trusted Cloud Ecosystem

CLOUD IS MORE SECURE THAN ON-PREMISE WHEN DONE RIGHT
BUILD A VIRTUAL, SOFTWARE-DEFINED, DEV(SEC)OPS, AUTOMATED PROGRAM FOR SECURITY AND AGILITY
SUPPORT RAPID RESPONSE PRIVACY
THINK TOWARDS THE FUTURE
CSA IS HAPPY TO BE YOUR PARTNER IN YOUR CLOUD JOURNEY
