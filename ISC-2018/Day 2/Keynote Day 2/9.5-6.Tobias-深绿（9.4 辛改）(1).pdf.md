1. Attacks in an uncertain world ­ "sophisticated" attacks vs."sophisticated" defenses - really...?

Wannacry at the NHS

Maersk Chairman: "NotPetya attack totally destroyed Maersk's computer network"´ - up to $300 Million

2017: 465,000 pacemakers
vulnerable to hacking, need a
firmware fix

2. Do the basics well
(sign in the gym above the weights...)

4. NIST CSF (1.1): what does this mean for us?
Add capabilities & investments from Protect => Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

· Boundaries, access control, authentication, authorization, segmentation, defense in depth, ...
· Data (data-at-rest, data-in-transit), · People: Awareness & Training · Network & Systems (secure config,
firewalls, AV, integrity (patching, updates, ...))

Protect

4. NIST CSF (1.1): what does this mean for us?
Add capabilities & investments from Protect => Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

· Sensors & Data analytics · Analysis and detection
capabilities · Automation · False-positive/false-negative
ratios · Understanding of context

· Response plans (pre-prepared, exercised, ..)
· Playbooks · how fast, how effective is
your response?
