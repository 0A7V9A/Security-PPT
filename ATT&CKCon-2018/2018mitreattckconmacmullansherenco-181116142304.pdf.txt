Intelligence Driven Defense (IDD) and ATT&CK

Intel

CIRT

OSINT collection

Actor tracking
and malware analysis

Ad hoc

IOC processing

Detection creation
Incident/alert response

Key Takeaways
1 Intel and CIRT need to break out of siloed operations à An automated platform can ensure continuity among teams throughout the wing-to-wing process
2 ATT&CK à An ATT&CK operational workflow serves as a common language between CIRT and Intel and drives better detection

What can the operationalization of ATT&CK enable?

Behavioral coverage and capabilities analytics

124%
ATT&CK alerts have a 124% higher true positive rate

In progress: actor tracking and prioritization

Key Takeaways
1 Operationalization à Integrated cross-team operations breaks down siloes and enables better communication, leading to higher fidelity alerts and better detection
2 Intelligence driven defense à Intelligence can drive and support the creation of detection tailored to behavioral trends observed in the wild
3 Value in the metadata à Hosting cross-team operations in a single tool allows for more complex analysis and a better understanding of behavioral coverage and threat trends
