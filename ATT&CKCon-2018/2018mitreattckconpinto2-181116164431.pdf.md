Identify and quantify ATT&CK type techniques for more every-day type
attacks

VCAF

Connect the Strategic (VERIS)
to the Tactical (ATT&CK)

ATT&CK for the Average Joe
· ATT&CK is way too focused on "APT-level" threats.
· Ability to expand the taxonomy through specific popular TAVs to provide more granularity
· PRE-ATT&CK does cover a few of those: · Phishing <-> Phishing · Establish / Maintain Infra <-> part of "C2"

Strategic + Tactical
· Automatic collection of attack patterns allows us to use DBIR-like machinery from structured telemetry data.
· Pinpoint industry likelihood tied to VERIS + VCAF + ATT&CK can help direct prioritization of what controls / detective measure someone should do first.

Challenges
· Lot of mapping work to do. Not straight 1:1. · Actual real live data from breaches to simulate
and predict. · Actual real live data from near-misses and
continuous improvement of companies to help measure improvements in security posture.

How can I help?
· Contribute to the DBIR with anonymized granular-level data on breaches.
· We really don't care who the customer is. Really
· If we get enough data, we have the opportunity to publish and Appendix on this on next year's DBIR.
