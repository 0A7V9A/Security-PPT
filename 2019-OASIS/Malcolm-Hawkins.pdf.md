On June 19, 2015, doctors insert a retinal implant into a patient's eye and connect it to high tech glasses, a camera and a video processing unit.
The idea is to cure blindness.

The idea is to extort money.
All a bad person needs is poorly developed or managed technology and the ability to execute malicious code.

T O D AY ' S R E AL I T Y
Information security is an economic inefficiency.

W HAT I S E CO NO M I C E F F I CI E NCY ?
Economic efficiency implies an economic state in which every resource is optimally allocated to serve each individual or entity in the best way while minimizing waste and inefficiency.
The ideal state is related to the welfare of the population as a whole with peak efficiency also resulting in the highest level of welfare possible based on the resources available.

T O D AY ' S R E AL I T Y
Our approach to information security is the cause of economic inefficiency.

TEMPORAL ADVANTAGE
To put it simply: threat actors have had a temporal advantage over us. We have
been playing catch-up for decades.

FAILURE TO INCLUDE AN $11 PART

1911 SOUTH POLE EXPEDITION
"...wait for the spring. To risk men and animals by continuing stubbornly once we have set off, is something I couldn't consider. If we are to win the game, the pieces must be moved properly; a false move and everything could be lost." - Roald Amundsen, Norwegian Explorer

1st to the Pole, led by Roald Amundsen

"Victory awaits him who has everything in order. Defeat is certain for him who has neglected to take all the necessary precautions in time."

PREVENTION & PANAMA

HOW IT BEGAN
In 1879, the French started building the Panama Canal.
Torrential rains averaging 200 inches a year washed away
much of the work.

A TOXIC CONTROL
The Solution? Quinine... ...but the quinine used to treat malaria left many workers deaf.

1903
· Panama declares itself a country. US gains construction rights.

THE TIMELINE
1909 · Work on canal
locks begins.

Aug 15 1914
· Canal officially opens in August.

Feb 1904
· US Congress officially created the Panama Canal Zone.

1913
· US Congress officially created the Panama Canal Zone.

PROBLEM? SOLUTION.
Major Ronald Ross discovered that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes.
The control of malaria was vital for the construction of the Panama Canal.

A MAN... HIS PLAN... AND A CANAL.
Experts on sanitation. Col. W.C. Gorgas, along with others in 1904, formed the sanitary department for the canal zone.

MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM RESULTS
 Eradication of yellow fever
 Death rate dropped in workers from 11.59 per 1000 in November 1906 to 1.23 per 1000 in December 1909
 Death rate dropped in total population from 16.21 per 1000 in July 1906 to 2.58 per 1000 in December 1909

ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY
The construction of the Panama Canal was made possible only after yellow fever and malaria were controlled.

LESSONS FOR SECURITY
Malaria wasn't eliminated but the root causes were identified, the source of problems were prevented, and construction was completed, leading to dramatic worldwide social and economic benefit.

"...where our interests are clear and our values are at stake and we can make a difference, we must act and we must lead."
