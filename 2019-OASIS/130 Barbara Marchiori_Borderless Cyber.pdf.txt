Every good plan must have ownership or else
fingers will always be pointing when something
goes wrong or nothing happens.

Identify a responsible entity for each activity and allocate a budget.

Develop a monitoring mechanism: This could be done
by a public body or an interagency/inter-ministerial working group defined as the coordinator of the strategy. This will be the entity that has the overall responsibility for the
strategy lifecycle and the strategy documentation itself.

Define the structure of
the coordinating entity, its exact responsibilities
and its relationships with the other stakeholders (ENISA, 2012).
