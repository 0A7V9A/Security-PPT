WHY NEED SHARDING? BENEFITS OF SHARDING  Extreme Scalability  Scale Out vs. Scale Up  Fault Isolation  No shared SAN  Global Data Distribution  Store particular data close to its consumers  Pilot & Rolling Upgrades  First test the changes on a small subset of data.  Cost Down  Because the size of a shard can be made arbitrarily small, deploying an SDB in a cloud consisting of low-end commodity servers with local storage becomes easy.

"Unlike NoSQL data stores, Oracle Sharding provides the benefits of sharding without sacrificing the capabilities of an enterprise RDBMS, such as relational schema, SQL and other programmatic interfaces, complex data types, online schema changes, multi- core scalability, advanced security, compression, highavailability, ACID properties, consistent reads, and many more..
-Oracle® Database Administrator's Guide 12c Release 2 (12.2)

Oracle 12C
THINK TWICE BEFORE JUMPING INTO SHARDING  MySQL: Not exceed 20GB per table is optimised. (Concurrent processing capacity)  How about we have a 2TB table? 100 shards!  What does 100 shards mean?  100 x86 servers  1 Primary, 1 Slave -> 200 servers  1 Primary, 2 Slaves -> 300 servers  How many routers do you need? How many cables? How many spaces?  Are you ready for maintaining so many servers?  99% server stableness means: Server down/EVERY day.
