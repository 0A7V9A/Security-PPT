Introduction

MITRE ATT&CK is made up of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
· Tactics are general goals (e.g., initial access, exfiltration)
· Techniques are descriptions of adversarial actions that achieve tactical goals (e.g., Spearphishing Attachment, Modify Registry, Input Capture)
· The community is interested in using ATT&CK for detection, prediction, forensics, and threat hunting because it provides behavioral observables for detecting attacks
Our goal:
· Characterize ATT&CK's structure and usefulness for automated detection, etc., by analyzing their APT dataset

Challenges for automated reasoning
MITRE ATT&CK TTPs are not correlated at the technique level MITRE ATT&CK techniques are not ordered temporally
- A kill-chain ordered set of techniques would be, for example: 1. Account Discovery 2. [weaponization] 3. Spearphishing Attachment 4. User Execution 5. Bypass User Account Control 6. Automated Collection, Data Compressed 7. Exfiltration over C2 Channel

What do you mean uncorrelated?

Searched for meaningful correlations among techniques using: · Partitioned Clustering - Finding the optimal K clusters - K means clustering - PAM clustering - Fuzzy Analysis clustering

- Cluster Validation · Hierarchical Clustering
- Finding the optimal K clusters - Agglomerative clustering - Divisive clustering

(Paper on this due out soon)

Only the Agglomerative clustering produces some results

For intuition behind this result, consider clustering coefficient of APT data set

Hopkins Statistic: assess the Using Phi Coefficient : H = 0.6
clustering tendency of a dataset by measuring the probability that a given dataset is generated by a uniform distribution ­ tests the spatial randomness of the data
Interpretability:
· H = 0.5: The data set contains no meaningful clusters
· H  1: The data set contains meaningful clusters
· H  0: The data set is regularly spaced (neither clustered nor random)

Attacks and Campaigns
ATT&CK merges the concept of attack with that of campaign This is true even though it uses the kill chain as a semiorganizational concept In the kill chain, an attack is a single exploitation attempt Campaigns are a series of planned or interrelated attacks The kill chain and diamond model are not perfect, but they are useful mental models to organize general knowledge in security · See Spring JM, Illari P. Building general knowledge of
mechanisms in information security. Philosophy & Technology. 2018 Sep 17:1-33.

Diamond model and Campaigns
The diamond model for campaigns includes some things that ATT&CK does not

Does it matter that ATT&CK is missing this temporal structure?
For automated reasoning, yes. · (It would matter for other things, like real-time analysis, too)
At least, if you want to understand the relationship between MITRE's APT data sets and the techniques they use, temporal killchain structure helps

Sequential Pattern Mining

Sequential pattern mining looks for technique rules based on which techniques often showed a related temporal order
Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence Classes: 1. Find the most frequent single length sequence 2. Observe the two-type temporal sequences (A occurs before B) and two-element item groupings (A and B appear together) 3. Based on the most frequent length-two outputs, find threeelement sequences and three element item groupings 4. Continues until no longer finds frequent outputs
Confidence: likelihood that the sequence rule A  B occurs among transactions containing item set A, where item set A is before B
· Extracted 19 technique rules with confidence of 0.5 or higher
* Beware base rate issues

Why should we care about related techniques?
To automate reasoning in incident analysis, it would help to know what adversary actions are most likely to look for, given what the analyst has seen already
ATT&CK could provide this, we're working on how to suggest such temporal structure (basically reintegrate the diamond model / kill chain)
If we had it clear and formalized, we could use it in formal, automated reasoning

Automated reasoning with ATT&CK?
Not yet Spring and Pym (2018) proposes a system for automated incident analysis, but to make it work it needs a corpus of what is likely given what has been seen · ATT&CK is an obvious place to looks for this · Therefore we could make progress on automating incident and
campaign analysis with some careful improvements
The target for automation is probably improving automated evidence collection and data discovery in a SIEM, so that an analyst can review incidents, and not alerts

One other barrier to automated reasoning with ATT&CK
Some techniques are subsets of others. For example: · Scripting · Powershell · Bash scripting
There do not seem to be guidelines on when an analyst tags an intrusion with the more general or more specific option The unified cyberspace ontology (UCO) tries to be a bit more rigorous about these relationships, but it does not have the same level of input from practitioners

Summary
The case studies captured in ATT&CK are valuable information for incident analysis The ATT&CK structure is not currently amenable to automated reasoning Two most important things to make it so: · Restore the temporal relationships between the techniques (as
in the Diamond Model) · Make hierarchy or subset relationships between techniques
explicit
