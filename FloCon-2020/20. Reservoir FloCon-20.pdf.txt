Tensor Decompositions in MITRE ATT&CK

Relevant techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework
· Depends on data decomposed · Focus on network flows
­ Netflow ­ Techniques detected via Netflow/Enclave Netflow ­ Zeek logs ­ Netflow + Network Protocol Analysis + Network Intrusion Detection

Relevant tactics
· When decomposing Zeek logs ...
­ Initial Access (3 of 11 techniques) ­ Execution (3 of 34) ­ Persistence (5 of 62) ­ Privilege Escalation (1 of 32) ­ Defense Evasion (5 of 69) ­ Credential Access (3 of 21)

­ Discovery (4 of 23) ­ Lateral Movement (4 of 18) ­ Collection (0 of 13) ­ Command and Control (20 of 22) ­ Exfiltration (3 of 9) ­ Impact (4 of 16)

Substantially increase coverage by adding, host data (e.g., Sysflow, Event Log, ...)

Need to Automate Anomaly Detection

Each component can take minutes or hours to manually investigate
Which components are interesting?

Often 100+ components needed to characterize network traffic
Most components are benign
Challenge is to identify and rank components representing anomalous behavior
Components are trailheads for further investigation

Topic Modeling for Component Classification
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
· Well-known Bayesian topic modeling algorithm · Learns topic model from a corpus of documents · Infers topic mixture of new documents · Online updates of topic model · Commonly used in other applications
­ Bioinformatics ­ Image, video, and sound processing ­ Collaborative filtering

· Mapping tensor decompositions to LDA concepts · Component (as vector) = "document" · Label = "word" · Score = "word count" · Topic = recognizable pattern of network behavior

LDA Dominant Topic Approach

Reservoir Labs 01.09.2020

14

Hierarchical LDA Approach
Learn topics in tree
· Coarse grain behavior at root, fine grain at leaves · Topic is weighted mixture of root-to-leaf paths in tree · Same approach as dominant topic otherwise

Component Reconstruction Approach
Addresses mathematical limitations of dominant topic approach Infer topic mixtures for unseen components and reconstruct with known topics Compare to unseen component and rank by reconstruction error

Decomposition Difference Approach

Compute similarity matrix between current and historical decomposition components Component(s) dissimilar to every historical component represents anomalous behavior Rank by max similarity

Unseen component matches historical component Unseen component does not match any historical component

Approximate Convex Hull Approach
Compute approximate convex hull of historical decomposition components If a component is a linear combination of historical components, it's inside the hull and we've seen all aspects of the behavior it represents Identify anomalous components outside hull, compute distance to hull Rank by distance to hull

Graphs and Databases in Context
Components only tell a small part of the story
· E.g., Timestamp, Source IP, Destination IP
Component represents beaconing behavior between two IP addresses. Is it C2 traffic? Hourly batch jobs? Hourly log transfers?

More information necessary to make a malicious / benign decision
· E.g., user, asset type, network topology, known behaviors, threat intel, ... · Needed info stored in external DB / graph / ... or enriched data in SIEM

Use anomalous component as trailhead into investigation
· Generate targeted queries to provide context and assist decision making · Massively reduces scope of graph / database analysis

Reservoir Labs 01.09.2020

FloCon 2020

23

Generating Targeted Queries
Use component labels with nonzero scores to generate "WHERE" clause
· E.g., "SELECT * WHERE ts=(00:00, 01:00, ...), src_ip=1.2.3.4, dst_ip=5.6.7.8"
Component represents beaconing behavior between two IP addresses. Is it C2 traffic? Hourly batch jobs? Hourly log transfers?

Problem: Data was binned before conversion to tensor

Solution Part 1: Generate backtracking data when building tensor
· Map tensor entries to lines in original log

Solution Part 2: Reconstruct into tensor, get subset of relevant log entries
· Original entries provide more context ­ exact timestamps, flow IDs, ...

Generating Targeted Queries

Use enriched data to filter false positives
· E.g., "SELECT * WHERE ts=(00:00, 01:00, ...), src_ip=1.2.3.4, dst_ip=5.6.7.8"
AND src_ip NOT "batch_server" AND src_ip NOT "log_transfer_hourly"
Component represents beaconing behavior between two IP addresses. Is it C2 traffic? Hourly batch jobs? Hourly log transfers?

Further queries based on results of targeted query
· Query within the returned data or use as guide for further focused queries
Targeted query massively reduces size of graph / DB / SIEM data to investigate
· Not "boiling the ocean" by running analytics over entire graph / DB / SIEM · Tensor decompositions highly optimized and run on ten-billion scale logs in
reasonable time (high minutes / low hours)
