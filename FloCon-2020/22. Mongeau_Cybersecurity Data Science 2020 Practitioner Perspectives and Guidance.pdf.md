DATA SCIENCE = Poorly defined standards
"whatever you want it to be!"
CSDS = At risk problem child?

The Blessing and Curse of Data Science

PROS
· Commercial interest · Range of methods
· Freedom to experiment · Delivers efficiencies · Big data engineering · Insightful questions
· Power of machine learning

CONS
· Hype & noise · Befuddling array of approaches · Lack of standards · Myth of automation · Big data ipso facto is not solution · Wait, what is the question? · "Throwing the statistical baby
out with grampa's bathwater?"

Synthesized Collected

- Field evidence - Probing & testing - 3rd party sourced

EXAMPLES OF SECURITY EVIDENCE
1. Field evidence (e.g. observed incidents) 2. Sourcing own data from field testing (e.g. local experiments) 3. Honeypots 4. IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) 5. Simulation findings 6. Laboratory testing (e.g. malware in a staged environment) 7. Stepwise discovery (iterative interventions) 8. Pen testing (attempts to penetrate the network) 9. Red teaming (staged attacks to achieve particular goals) 10. Incidents (records associated with confirmed incidents) 11. Reinforcement learning (self-improving ML to achieve a goal) 12. Research examples (datasets recording attacks from research) 13. Expert review (opinion and guidance from experts) 14. Intelligence feed (indications from a 3rd party service) 15. Thought experiments (e.g. boundary conditions, counterfactuals)
