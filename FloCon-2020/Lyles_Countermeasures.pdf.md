Problem Statement

 Lack of effective countermeasures for cyber threats to networked medical devices:
 attack on a medical device is likely to occur;
 risks between networks and medical devices;
 security risks leading to unauthorized personnel;
 breach with sensitive data pertaining to PHI.

Purpose of the Research

 Create a model for developing effective countermeasures for cyber threats
 Networked medical devices;
 Healthcare industry;
 United States.

Research Questions

What are the relevant experiences in employing a schema to analyze security risks in networked medical devices?

Summary of Research Design

 Method: Qualitative Research
 Design: Delphi Study
 Sample Size: 15 IT experts in healthcare experience with medical devices
 Rationale: developed a model for effective countermeasures based on experiences and perceptions of IT experts in the phenomenon with networked medical devices
 Selection Criteria: IT experts working in the health field

Data Collection Process

 Apply  Real-time  Manual Implementation  Mitigation Risk
 Address  Lockdown  Report  Run automated

Summary of Implications

 IT Experts agreed that manufacturers are crucial within the process of implementing security when developing and throughout lifecycle of the device.
 Clinicians or patients remain uneducated about the methods for evaluating security risks with networked medical devices;
 Impacts for IT Support and organizations supporting networked medical devices enhance improve upon cybersecurity and device awareness;
 Scholars may leverage the model developed, employing increasing efficiency identifying areas of risk

Recommendation for Future Research

 Explore and examine  how patients use medical devices  how such behaviors impact issues of security  public perceptions of cyber healthcare risks associated with the use of medical devices and if such perceptions alter the use of devices and/or individual health outcomes  Hospitals from which these devices come  How do hospitals create IT policy based on cybersecurity risk?  In what ways do the organizational elements of the hospital dictate how they manage cybersecurity risks?

Continue Recommendati on for Future Research

 Using the model developed
 gauge how such a model is successful in helping prevent cybersecurity attacks on medical devices
 Using a Case Study
 how this model aids specific hospitals, or specific types of medical devices, from cyberattacks
 Regulations
