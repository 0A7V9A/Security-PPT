 Database Sharding

· 

Horizontal

partitioning of data across independent databases (shards)

­ CPU
Shard has own CPU, memory and disk

· 
Holds a subset of data

· 
Replication for availability and additional scalability

­ 
App must be designed to shard

·  -  Linear
scalability - data, workload and users

·  Maximum fault isolation

­ 
Outage affects only 1 of N shards
­  Mixed DB releases across shards

Session-Based Routing via Shard Key

·  customer_id
Clients  specify  service  and  key  (e.g.,   customer_id)
· /,  
Shard  Director    looks  up  service/  key  and   redirects  client  to  shard  DB  containing  the   data
· SQL
Client  executes  SQL  directly  at  shard
