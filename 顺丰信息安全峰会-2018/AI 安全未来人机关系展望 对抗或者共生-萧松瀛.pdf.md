IDC MarketScape: Asia/Pacific Threat Lifecycle Services 2018 Vendor Assessment
 According to customer feedback included in the
report, FireEye provides threat intelligence competitors don't offer.
 IDC noted that FireEye's global network of
intelligence specialists collect and analyze adversarial intelligence and machine intelligence based on FireEye detection technology deployed in client environments.
 One important differentiation highlighted in the
report is FireEye's more complete visibility into attackers and threat evidence across the organization captured by FireEye technology and analysts.
