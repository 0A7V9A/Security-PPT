Our Cloud Journey ­ Initial Expectations
· Started journey back in 2018 · Multi-vendor cloud strategy · Enable Self Service model · Migrate existing applications · Focus on speed of adoption · Embrace DevOps · No pets allowed mentality, everything CI/CD · Enable rapid series innovation · Embedded Security (seamless) · Process automation
Cloud Transformation · DevOps · App modernization · New Roles & Responsibilities · Continuous Learning & Teaching

Our Cloud Journey ­ Reality
Change is hard. There is comfort in familiar ways. Change means being uncomfortable.

Our Cloud Journey ­ A few lessons learned
· Not all applications can reach or need full CI/CD pipeline
· 3rd party applications, vendors need to provide SaaS, Marketplace, or Cloud template solutions instead of migrating non-cloud certified packages
· Container adoption was easier and more broadly accepted
· We now have lots of Pets, but a whole lot of innovation!!!

Pets + Cattle + Ghosts

Pets

Cattle

Ghosts

Cloud instances that need taken care of.

Cloud instances built using automated tools and designed
for failure.

Cloud instances that existed once and may reappear as a different instance. Instances that are running and no one
knows they exist.

When cloud vulnerability practices are operating as expected

Golden Image Process

Approval/Released

Deploy < 30 days

Validate

Report

Golden Images ­ produce new images that meet security standards (patches) on regular basis Approve Images ­ have cloud team approve images prior to publishing Communicate that redeployments need to occur every "x" number of days Validate ­ redeployments are occurring as expected Reporting - review reports to show progress

When cloud vulnerability practices are not operating as expected

10 Things that you should consider for cloud vulnerability management

1 Accurate inventory of cloud assets 2 Determine scanning / detection tooling across CSP's 3 Test zero day response plan 4 Integrate data into reporting tools 5 Address containers differently than EC2, etc

6 Patch tooling and support (disk space, access, etc)
7 Process map all vulnerability management processes for cloud and document
8 Clear communication on roles and responsibilities and pets vs cattle
9 Plan for Non-Compliance ­ escalate, blacklist, shutdown?
10 Review vulnerability reporting on regular basis

12

Automation for the win!
Asset Inventory ­ system that can pull asset information automatically on regular basis
Scanning / Detection ­ Configure automated scanning, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Use cloud native services where possible
Golden AMI - Implement an approval process before images are released. Have security team review standard installed software (security agents) and review vulnerability reports
13

Automation
Automate deployments, require app teams to rehydrate their applications every "x" days per your policy Review your processes, look for opportunities for automation / efficiencies
Automate with blacklisting, don't allow images to run if they are out of compliance
14

Automation
Integrate scanning tool outputs into your reporting mechanisms
Put accountability back on the application teams to redeploy in order to maintain compliance
15

Zero Day Advances
So you've discovered a new zero day.. So you've discovered all impacted assets.. So you think you've patched everything .... Now you've reported all vulnerabilities have been mitigated... But wait, there's more....
Cloud assets are dynamic in nature. New instances spin up and down all the time...
