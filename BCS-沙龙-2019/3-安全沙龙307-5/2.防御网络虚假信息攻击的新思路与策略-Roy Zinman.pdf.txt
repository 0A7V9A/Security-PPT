MONITORING FOR IW ATTACKS
Monitor your brand and online assets in real time Understand and monitor the threat actors Follow IW attacks on competitors, industry members

DETECTION FOR IW ATTACKS
Consider information leaks as potential attack vectors Detect and identify the adversary narrative Identify adversary media assets Identify fake profiles promoting adversary narrative Create and keep a database of rival assets

MITIGATION FOR IW ATTACKS
Be transparent - Minimize exposure to leaks and damaging rumors Prepare and maintain your own online assets and community Prepare your counter ­ narratives

INCIDENT RESPONSE FOR IW ATTACKS
Rapid takedown of adversary assets Expose fakery and inauthentic behavior Disseminate counter-narrative with force

SUMMARY
 Government and corporate organizations are exposed to IW attacks more than ever  A carefully planned IW attack can be more damaging than any cyber attack, affecting
stability, brand equity and stock prices  Defending against IW requires a cybersecurity mindset, but also an understanding of
social behavior, psychology and narrative  Correct stance, tools and analysis can minimize the effect and even prevent dangerous
IW attacks
