"A password is a word or string of characters used for user authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource (example: an access code is a type of password), which is to be kept secret from those not allowed access.

Password Guessing
· Dictionary Guessing
Use popular passwords, with mangling rules.
· Brute-force Guessing
Search all the password space.

Dictionary Guessing----John the Ripper
Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888.

Graphic Passwords

Graphic Passwords
· Graphical passwords are knowledge-based authentication mechanism which leverage human memory for visual information with the shared secret related to or composed of images or sketches to improve the memorability of passwords while reserving the security of traditional passwords.
· Types:
· Recall-based · Recognition-based · Cued-recall
Graphical passwords: Learning from the first twelve years - Biddle, Chiasson, et al. - 2011

Recall-based system
· Draw & Recall · Examples
· Draw-A-Secret (DAS) · Pass-Go

Recognition-based System
· Password Creation
· Memorize a portfolio of images in password creation
· Login
· Recognize those chosen images among decoys to log in
· Examples:
· Passfaces · Story

Passfaces
· Password Creation
· Users pre-select a set of human faces.
· Login
· users select the face belonging to their choices among decoys in a panel of candidate faces.
· The process will repeat several rounds with different panel.
· Only when each round is executed correctly will users login.

Password Manager

Password Manager
· Password manager is a software application or a hardware tool that can help users store and organize passwords.
· Motivation
· Strong passwords are always complex · Too many account's passwords to keep in mind · Password reuse leads to vulnerability of password leakage
