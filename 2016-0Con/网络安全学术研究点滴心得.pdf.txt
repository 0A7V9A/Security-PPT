The primary recommendations from all of these documents boil down to these two points:

 1) Do not allow open recursive DNS servers if possible.
2) Employ ingress filtering on your network to defeat IP spoofing.

FCC 5.4.1.1 Recommendations 1) ISPs should implement BCPs and recommendations for securing an ISP's recursive DNS infrastructure against Reflective DNS Amplification DDoS attacks that are

enumerated in the following documents:

5.4.2 Ghost Domains

 FCC Ghost domain2012 Best Practice 

In February 2012, a new, quite effective technique for maintaining a suspended domain that has been removed from its TLD zone was discovered. Such an attack has been given the moniker of a "ghost domain".40 An attacker can easily set up a legitimate domain (e.g. hacker.com) and control the domain's authoritative name server. The attacker will then submit DNS queries for www.hacker.com through several recursive name servers (which their botnets can query successfully from any ISP or network they reside), forcing the DNS servers to resolve www.hacker.com and cache the results, including nameserver information for that domain, and the IP address (controlled by the attacker) for the nameservers. Once hacker.com is identified as a malicious domain, remediation action will occur that will lead to the top-level domain registry (for .com in this example) removing hacker.com from their zone file. However, the recursive name servers will not query the top-level domain authoritative server (and subsequently remove hacker.com from their own records) until their cached TTLs for hacker.com and its authoritative nameservers expire. Consequently, by querying each targeted recursive name server regularly for new hostnames under hacker.com, those recursive nameservers will query the cached authority nameservers for the domain, which remains cached. The attacker will refresh the

We believe the attacks you mentioned are valid and can be a great danger to CDNs and Internet in general. This is indeed something we take very seriously
We wonder if you are willing to coordinate the effort of communicating with different CDNs to...

===== Paper strengths ===== (1) The paper exposes a real problem, and fairly comprehensively explores its prevalence in practice. (2) The authors were careful about contacting CDNs before performing certain experiments, and limiting the impact of the experiments, e.g., by putting a "regulator" node in the loops that they created. (3) The paper provides sensible and practical suggestions for mitigating the vulnerabilities. ....
===== Paper strengths =====
* Interesting attack and thorough survey of its efficacy on various CDN providers. * Not just an attack paper; describes defenses. * Responsibly contacted (and received responses!) CDN providers.
