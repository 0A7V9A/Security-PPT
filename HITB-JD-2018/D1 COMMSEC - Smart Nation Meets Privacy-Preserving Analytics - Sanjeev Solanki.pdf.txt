The Problem
How to securely combine, aggregate and analyze data from disparate sources to reveal insights that are hidden otherwise?

Sharing sensitive data as-is is too risky
and often illegal
15th ANNIVERSARY

Encrypted data with off-theshelf cyber security products
is useless for analysis

Enabler of seamless data integration between variety of organization without risk of privacy breach ­ a key requirement of Smart Nation development
· SMPC guarantees that none of the parties learn the inputs
· SMPC gives everybody the aggregated output of computation
· SMPC is able to operate with malicious agents in the system
· SMPC is key-less unlike homomorphic systems
