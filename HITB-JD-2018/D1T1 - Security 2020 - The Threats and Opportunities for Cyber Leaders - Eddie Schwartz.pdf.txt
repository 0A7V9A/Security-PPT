Artificial Intelligence DRIVEN Security
Key Constraints of AI Historically in Cyber Security:
· Costs of Storage · Limits of Computing Power · No HUMANS to Figure Out the Use Cases /
Code
Opportunities for Growth in AI:
· Costs of Storage Are Exponentially Decreasing (Collect)
· Computing Power is Exponentially Increasing (Analyze)
· Extensive interest in China and the US

Risk = · Prioritized, Assets You Really Need
to, and Can Protect · Situational Awareness of Your Real
Attack Surface (Vulns) · Mapping the Capabilities of the
Adversaries (Threats) that Want Those Assets

Security Leaders in 2020 · Aligned with the business · Focus on what matters
most · More automation and ML · More intel sharing · Better humans · Vacation now and then
