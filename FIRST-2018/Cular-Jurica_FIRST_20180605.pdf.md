What transposition is?
Jurica Cular | First Conference | Kuala Lumpur 2018

EU Directive vs EU regulation
· EU Regulation
· Immediately applicable and enforcable by law in all Member States
· As good practice, Member States issue national legislation that defines the competent national authorities, inspection and sanctions on the subject matter
· EU Directive
· Sets certain aims, requirements and concrete results that must be achieved in every Member State
· Sets a process for it to be implemented by Member States · National authorities must create or adopt their legislation to
meet these aims by the date specified in each given Directive

Centralized Vs. Sectoral
· Depending on current country set up · Centralized:
· Single organization · Cyber skilled setup, NCSC
· Sectoral
· Multiple sectoral authorities · Dispersed management
Jurica Cular | First Conference | Kuala Lumpur 2018

Legislation scheme
· OES and DSP cyber security law
· Roles · Deadlines · Criteria · Penalties
· Statute on cyber security measures
· Security measures · Reporting procedures
· Guidelines
Jurica Cular | First Conference | Kuala Lumpur 2018

Criteria - challenges
· What is essential? · Different views by each sector · Several types of criteria:
· Number of users · Unique service provider · Capacities · Market share · Geographic dispersity

Croatia custom design
