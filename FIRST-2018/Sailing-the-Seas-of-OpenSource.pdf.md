Avast!
Here be Cap'n CRob
Scurvy dog that be herd'n cats for a large Commercial OSS vendor
Most of what he says are solely his thoughts.....ish
CRob does NOT represent all of THE OPEN SOURCE....please be kind

1.
Wut is Open Source?

Open Source refers to works that the original source code is made freely available for redistribution and reuse, they are typically written by communities of developers

2.
Why iz tha Open Sources so Awesome?

25,300,000
Number of repositories with activity in the last year on GitHub Oct2017
https://octoverse.github.com/

Why
 The best ideas win (aka Meritocracy)  Speed and agility  Collaboration  Fast innovation  No lock-in  The source code is publicly available for
review  You are (normally) able to edit/augment
the code

3.
Nice People You'll Meet in OSS

Awesome OSS People!

So many beards......

Nice People That work in OPen Source

Individuals OSS is driven by the innovation and creativity of little people with BIG ideas

Small Communities Oftentimes these individuals will find each other and collaborate on these ideas

Commercial Vendors OSS always is free and available to use, but some end-users want a higher level of support; There are many vendors that provide commercial support (with documentation, support, training, ...and package updates)

Large Communities Certain ideas have so much interest that a formal group sometimes develop, with
These groups all have different goals and different ways to communicate. They are all unified by a passion for Open source ideals!

4.
Open Source is "free" like my kid's Free fish

CRob's "free fish" bill:

>$200 USD

The moral
Open Source is kinda like a free fish
You generally have extra work to do around the fish.
It can be pretty cool (that bubbly pirate chest was THA AWESOMES)!
If you leave a 12 yr old to oversee it it's GOING to die. <--FACT
.... In other words, with a little bit of effort, it can be beautiful, but it takes work!

5.
To be successful you must do some stuff...
(I know, this free software is a real drag, man!)

Stuff and Things to think about
 In general, there is little to no formal organization around most OSS
 There are several larger projects (kernel, Apache Foundation, Openssl) that are more mature and structured
 When using open source packages you need to decide how you want support: Free (aka "Dr. Google"), Fee (commercial), or Community (build your reputation)

Several Important concepts

Distribution
This (typically) refers to someone offering a "boxed" Linux flavour. It is generally (but not always) is based off of a commercial or very large community-curated set of packages

Upstream

Downstream

This is the source of some software package or collection of packages. E.g.- kernel.org is a group of developers (headed up my Linus) that maintains the Linux kernel. It is not directly affiliated with any commercial entity (although "corporate" engineers do contribute

This is the consumer of some upstream package/project. If you embed the Tomcat webserver in your products, you're considered "downstream". This is rarely a formal arrangement

Some other terms you should be aware of

Backporting
This is when specific patches are brought into some form of downstream offering. This is not the exact code released from upstream

Rebasing
When the whole upstream package is used and delivered via some downstream offering

Big concept
 TALK...yes actually talk to the maintainer of that package (OSS is cool like that that you CAN actually DO that...we don't bite.......hard.)

Cap'n CRob's Guide to #winning tha Open Sources
 KNOW what you're putting into your products (If you don't have a manifest of packages and dependencies you are NOT tall enough to ride this ride)
 UNDERSTAND how those packages are developed and maintained

The Sandwich Paradox

What's in the sammich and how it was made matter
 Chain of custody/package ancestry matter  Trusted builds by trusted maintainers on protected
infrastructure  Changes documented and tracked  Signed with authorized_keys

More #winning....
 CONTRIBUTE to projects you care about (or get support from nice people that do such things)  "Contributing" can mean many things Adding patches to make the project better, Peer code reviews, compute/storage resources, training/guidance, and so many other ways...... (so many)

6.
So how do I find these open source people?

Open source is everywhere...here's how to learn more....
 Github  Mailing Lists....so many mailing lists (so many)  Forums/Communities  Project Pages  The Linux Foundation or other groups  Conferences  Most likely, get up and walk around your
office...odds are SOMEONE at your company codes in their spare time  ....CRob likes hugs too

Thanks!
