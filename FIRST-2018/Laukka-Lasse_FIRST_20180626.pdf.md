Learnings from the past years

ISAC will only function properly if a sufficient level of trust is established between the members
» Face to face meetings are MUST
ISAC will only function properly if participants share information
» What you share is what you get!

Networking and social events will enhance the possibilty to strenghten the trust between individuals
3-4 times a year is an optimal face-to-face meeting interval
» Active use of other communication channels ensures the information exchange meanwhile

Groups with more than 15 participants will erode the level of trust!

Collaboration can be
» Simple » Effective » Cheap
But you need to have
» Trust
