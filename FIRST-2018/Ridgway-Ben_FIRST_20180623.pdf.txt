Microsoft Security Response Center Ben Ridgway

Lizard Brain ­ Fight flight or freeze Monkey Brain ­ Dishonor is death Human Brain ­ Leisurely logical

SIR is a human problem
And when we get it wrong... · Poor decision making skills · Failure to follow process · Costly operational mistakes · Failed court cases · Burnout

Strategies for successfully navigating the human factor

Learn to spot Monkey Brain
· Physical response · Like/Dislike teammates · Must prove you are right · How trumps what · Labeling of others · Excuses/Justifications

Step 1 De-escalate yourself

Reasoning with the Monkey Brain
· Use Team Speak · Highlight triumphs · Don't postmortem until the post mortem · Empathize with detractors · Be open with your plans
Throw the monkey a banana

Filling leadership vacuums
· Monkeys and lizards thrive in leaderless situations
· Will the loudest monkey please stand up?
· Step in: · It doesn't matter where, just move · Remember: everybody is faking it · BUT: don't lead through ignorance · When all else fails: ask questions

Discipline isn't accidental
IR teams try to move fast and loose
Make documentation a core function
"Discovery" cases: 1 per 4-6 analysts Everything else: 1 per 6-8 analysts
Proper prior preparation

Combatting Fatigue

Fatigue is your most dangerous adversary
· Day 1: no more than 16-hours straight · Day 2-7: no more than 10-hours straight · Day 7-n: no more that 10-hours straight for 4
consecutive days

The simplest and most effective way to combat IR team fatigue:
Regularly reevaluate the objective
· Is what we are doing getting us there? · Is there anything we are doing that we
don't need to do?

Long term impact of stress and fatigue
· Memory and concentration impairment · Anxiety · Depression · Digestive problems · Headaches · Heart disease · Sleep problems · Weight gain
