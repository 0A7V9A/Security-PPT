Our story begins...

Industry Consortium for the Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI)
· Made up of 11 industry members (Cisco, IBM, Intel, Juniper Networks, Microsoft, A10 Networks, Amazon, Blackberry, Honeywell International, Oracle, & VMWare)
· Working together to drive security, implement strategic solutions, and enhance the global security ecosystem.
· Developing & sharing best practices · Collaborate on ecosystem wide problems and awareness · Multi-party Vulnerability Disclosure process (USIRP)
· https://www.icasi.org

Our role in KRAck
· ICASI played the role of industry coordinator · Using our pre-established trust network and tested incident
response process we brought in industry players that could directly address the vulnerabilities
­ Consolidated and gave forum to the researcher to address major industry PSIRTs at once
­ Utilized trust network between members to share understanding and possible solutions to the report
­ Utilized light-weight NDA to bring in other industry members that were not part of the consortium (8 in total)
· Engaged with the researcher affinity groups to broaden reach to affected PSIRTs
­ CERT/CC ­ WiFi Alliance
· Orchestrated single landing page for industry response to KRAck vulnerabilities

Things we all struggle with
1. Trust at scale 2. Asset Management 3. Understanding dependencies

What Challenged Us
· Secure communications · Bringing new people up to
speed · Rapidly deploying knowledge
after release

What Went Well
· Collaborative trust structure · Quick way to establish trust · Coordination with researcher
and each other on messaging · Partnering with other affinity
groups

Multi-party Vulnerability Disclosure

1. Trust 2. Collaboration 3. Focus on the outcome

Lessons to Better Fix & Disclose
1.Think bigger than self 2.Trust relationships 3. Tents 4.How to share 5.Create Orchestrator Role 6.Parachute cords 7.Softer landing

Think bigger than yourself

Trust relationships
· How do we trust and scale for this challenge? · Shared goal to protect the ecosystem
· Likely means multiple trusted communities · Need to be built before incidents
· Trust is absolutely central to succeeding with Multi-party Vulnerability Disclosure

Tenting
STARTS WITH TRUST

· Fix Providers · Enablers · Affinity Groups or
Scalers · More?
· When does each tent engage?

How to share?
· PSIRTs have tackled this problem within organizations?
· Often based on least privilege · Tied closely with engineering processes
· How do we turn this outward? · What are the artifacts that need to be shared? · Executive & Legal review may be required
· Danger of just consuming...

Create an orchestrator role
· Dedicated role · Empowered and recognized by all participants · Contact conduit with researcher · Balancer of competing priorities

Parachute cords
· What are your triggers for action?
· Critical safety measure (operational risk management)
· Often thought of too late or not at all
· Scenarios are often durable · Discuss and agree prior to incidents

Softer landing
· What happens at release?
· By definition, tent will limit participants. · How do you bring community up to speed? · How do you avoid enabling attackers?
· Greatest area we can improve and see big gains

Our Remaining Work as a Community
· Define and refine the community norms · Develop communities of trust · Create a better soft landing · What is the role of government CERTs in this and
when should they be notified?
Some Opportunities · FIRST's Vulnerability Coordination SIG · FIRST's Vendor SIG · Trusted Communities like ICASI
