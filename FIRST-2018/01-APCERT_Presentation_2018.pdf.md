Why do we need APCERT?
· Cyber threat landscape continues to evolve

· Range of threats is ever increasing ­ seeing two distinct trends 1. Targeted: Increasingly sophisticated exploits are being developed and deployed against well-protected networks 2. Broad-based: Criminals compromising networks using publicly known vulnerabilities that have known mitigations (eg WanaCry)

· Current challenges · Ransomware · Business Email Compromise / Social engineering · Targeting trusted third parties · DDoS

· The challenges are not national ­ they are regional and global · Theft of money, data (corporate & personal) and intellectual property · Extortion attacks such as denial of service and ransomware · Malware hosted on compromised websites · Spear phishing emails / Business email compromise ­ network access & fraud

How does APCERT work?
CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team)
· Independent from politics, industry, market... · Do not focus on WHO and WHY, focus on WHAT and HOW
from a technical coordination perspective
CSIRT Common Policy
· MY security depends on YOUR security · Web of trust
Systematic Handling
· Timely manner · Each team has appropriate domestic contacts to handle and
respond to incidents (ISPs, critical infrastructure, government...) · Mailing lists, Traffic Light Protocol, encrypted e-mail · Reaching to disconnected areas using CSIRT network
POC arrangement between members
· One Point of Contact per economy · Deal with serious and time critical computer security incidents · Reachable 24 hours / 7 days via call
