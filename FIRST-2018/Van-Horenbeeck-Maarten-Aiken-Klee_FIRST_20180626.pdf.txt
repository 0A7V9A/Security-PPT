FIRST: The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams

Our vision
· Global Coordination: In an emergency you can always find the teams you need to support you in our global community.
· Global Language: Incident responders around the world speak the same language and understand eachother's intents and methods.
· Automation: Let machines do the boring stuff, so humans can focus on the hard stuff
· Policy and Governance: Make sure others understand what we do, and enable us rather than limit us.

Intrusion Software Software specially designed or modified to avoid detection by `monitoring tools', or to defeat `protective countermeasures' of a computer or network capable device, and performing any of the following: a. The extraction of data or information, from a computer or network capable device, or the modification of data of a system or user; or b. The modification of the standard execution path of a program or process in order to allow the execution of externally provided instructions; or

Regional processes
· ASEAN: ASEAN Way, develop more predictable relationships · SCO: proposed international code of conduct under the UN
­ Focus on multilateral approach vs. multi-stakeholder ­ Highlights "sovereignty"
· Implications on technology provenance

United Nations
· Call for input from 2010 through 2016 ­ Countries can share their own projects and progress ­ Flag issues they have that require international collaboration
· Government Group of Experts (UNGGE) · International Telecommunications Union
­ Build "confidence and security" ­ Global Cybersecurity Agenda · Internet Governance Forum · ITU

What is being done?
· Laws and treaties · Signers accept roles and responsibilities, ability to hold someone liable
· Confidence Building Measures · Opportunities for states to interact, often on a voluntary basis · Enables growth of interaction and cooperation
· Capacity Building · Norms of behavior
· Developed in "norms melting pots" · Confirmed and enforced through behaviors between groups of actors · You distinguish norms through other's reaction when they are violated

So what are norms anyways?
`collective expectations about proper behavior for a given identity'

Who defines normal?
UNGGE `States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams of another State'

Global Commission on the Stability of CyberSpace (GCSC) `States and non-state actors should not conduct or knowingly allow activity that intentionally and substantially damages the general availability or integrity of the public core of the Internet, and therefore the stability of cyberspace.'
