Introduction

Why Exercising is Required for CSIRTs?

A CSIRT can most easily be described by analogy with a fire department. ­ Handbook of CSIRTs, CMU

Purpose of exercise

· Become mentally ready for cyber attacks

and familiar with incident handling

procedure · Extract issues and problems on current

Risk Assessment
(Attack Scenario)

incident handling procedure and environment

Enhance

(Virtual Experience)

· Improve incident handling manual

Conducting Exercises is a Required Capability for CSIRTs
FIRST CSIRT Service Framework 1.1
Service Area 6 Capability Development
6.3 Service - Conducting Exercises 6.3.1 Function - Format and Environment Development 6.3.2 Function - Scenario Development 6.3.3 Function - Executing Exercises 6.3.4 Function - Exercise Outcome Review
NIST SP800-171 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations
3.2 AWARENESS AND TRAINING
3.2.2 Ensure that organizational personnel are adequately trained to carry out their assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.

But, Half of CSIRTs have No Experience on Exercises
A survey conducted in 2016(*) says, almost half of CSIRTs have no experience on incident response exercise.
Do you have an experience on incident response exercise? Yes - United States: 39.4%, Europe: 34.7%, Japan: 33.4%

Incident Response Exercising Working Group of Nippon CSIRT Association, Japan
· Started on April, 2016
· Almost 70 CSIRTs in Japan
· Regular meeting (quarterly):  Sharing experiences of exercise at members' CISRT  Execution of tabletop exercise
· Output: · Guide for executing tabletop exercise · Tabletop exercising toolset

Features of Our Tabletop Exercising Method (1 of 2)

Feature 1: Blue team vs Red team Exercise

Making up for the lack of facilitation skills

#1 Notification of incident

#2 Initial damage

Blue Team

Action List
 action 1  action 2  action 3  action 4 

No #3 Secondary

damage Expected action

was taken?

#4 Clue to

Yes

the cause

Red Team

Evaluation 1. Secondary damage was prevented ? 2. Cause of the incident was identified ?

Features of Our Tabletop Exercising Method (2 of 2)

Feature 2: Random Scenario Creation with Cards

Making easy to develop exercising scenario and save preparation time

Step 1 Select a base scenario Step 2 Select surrounding conditions

Base Scenarios

with cards

 Zero-day attack

 Backdoor attack  Internal fraud

Backdoor attack

Step 3 Improvise the scenario at execution of the exercise

Closing Remarks

Expected Effects of Our Tabletop Exercising Method

Feature Blue team vs red team exercise
Random Scenario Creation using cards

Expected effects brought by the feature
· Skilled facilitator is not required · Enforces red team members to think as an
attacker
· Easy to develop an exercising scenario · Save time for developing an exercising scenario

An Example: Application at Workshop Seminar
· Optional training at TRANSITS Workshop in Japan · Introduced an actor of CISO and trained about,
Reporting to busy CISO ­ CISO is in the CISO Summit Press interview ­ CISO must achieve their accountability

Future Works
· Sample scenario enhancement based on case study of real incidents
· Introducing log analysis and timeline concept
· The TTX toolset is provided for free Please contact: nca-drilling-wg-owner@nca.gr.jp
