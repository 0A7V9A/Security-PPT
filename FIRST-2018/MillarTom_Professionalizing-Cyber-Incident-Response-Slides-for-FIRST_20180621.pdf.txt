Professionalization:
What it Means

Professions are more than just specialized work, however. Consider:

"To make an activity into a job that requires specialized education, training or skill"*

оо Nurses
оо Lawyers
оо Accountants
All of these fields have another thing in common besides specialized knowledge. They require, and provide, trust and confidence.

Building Blocks of a Profession
"A profession relies on specialized knowledge and skills that require a long period of study;
*https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/technology/

The occupational group has a monopoly on the carrying out of the occupation;
The assessment of whether the professional work is carried out in a competent way is done by, and it is accepted that this can only be done by, professional peers;
A profession provides society with products, services or values that are useful or worthwhile for society, and is characterized by an ideal of serving society;
The daily practice of professional work is regulated by ethical standards, which are derived from or relate to the society-serving ideal of the profession."*

Gap Analysis
FLY-AWAY KIT

TLP:WHITE
Current certification and education schemes are "in the middle" - technical, vocational training, tests of overall knowledge, some with limited codes of conduct.
We may need a range of certifications, academic / educational tracks, and associations - similar to nurses and surgeons, or global, management and public accountants, or regional / local bar associations.
Regardless, we need to acknowledge the society-serving ideal of our career field, and that must be reflected in our ethics and conduct.

What, Who, How? When AND Where?

TLP:WHITE
 An accreditation system of peers is necessary, and it has to start somewhere.
 A diverse coalition of experienced and respected members of the field is also necessary
оо it will also be necessary for them to agree on things (yes, I know)
 Organizational and funding models have to be sorted out, but should not come before the principles and long-term goals of the field.
 The time is NOW - the technical has become political, and our field is lacking a unified voice in matters that affect our work (another thing that professional associations can do).
 "Where" - choosing the forum or venue in which to do this work - is up to us.
