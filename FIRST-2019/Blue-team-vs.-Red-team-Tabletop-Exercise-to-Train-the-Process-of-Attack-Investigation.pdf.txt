Introduction

Why Exercise is Necessary for CSIRTs?

Preparation

Detection & Analysis

Containment Eradication &
Recovery

Post-Incident Activity

The purpose of exercise is to realize resilience and effectiveness of Incident response.
· Become to have mental readiness for cyber attacks and make familiar with incident handling procedure
· Extract issues and problems on current incident handling procedure and environment
A CSIRT can most easily be described by analogy with a fire department.

Workshop at FIRST Conference 2018
We developed a tabletop exercise method, and made a hands-on demonstration at FIRST Conference 2018. The toolkit was shared with 25 workshop participants over 15 countries after the conference.
The countries our toolkit has been distributed

Developing the Method
We developed a method which is focused on log analysis and containment. Feasibility of the method has been verified through several trials at Incident Handling Exercise SIG of Nippon CSIRT Association (NCA), Japan.
Incident Handling Exercise SIG of Nippon CSIRT Association, Japan - SIG started on April 2016 - SIG members from 105 CSIRTs in Japan

Features of Our Tabletop Exercise Method

Feature 1: Blue team vs Red team Exercise

Blue team = CSIRT

Red team = Attacker & SOC

Injections
Questions Requests
Response

· Enforces red team members to think as an attacker · Skilled facilitator is not required

Features of Our Tabletop Exercise Method
Feature 2: Random Scenario Making with Cards

Notification of Incident

Injection Cards

Initial Damage

Select

Secondary Damage
· Easy to develop an exercising scenario · Enable to save time for developing an exercising scenario

Features of Our Tabletop Exercise Method
Feature 3: Focused on Containment and Investigation of Attack

Malware was detected !!

What steps did the attacker use to infect the PC with malware?

? ? ??

· Improve the ability to discover attack process by analyzing log (as footprints) and decide suitable actions for minimizing the damage

Overview: What Blue & Red Team Do?

Blue team

Red team

· Discuss and present the countermeasures/actions to Red team, after receiving injection cards from Red team.
· Request log analysis to blue- team by using the request cards
· Note-taker write down the actions given by the commander on action recording sheet.

Injections
Questions Requests Response

· Present injection cards to Blue team
· Answer/respond to questions or requests from Blue team, based on your scenario
· Observe the blue-team actions for later review

Closing

How to Utilize Our Method
· Enhance reality by modifying the training kit reflect the actual system architecture and log file acquisition status in your own organization · Improve capability by switching between red-team and blue-team · Apply the training kit for integrated training with multiple system personnel involved
