Hosting space and top talkers
39

Where are these hosted? Any patterns?
 Take 1 week's worth of detections and their hosting space; Jan 1-7
 Some hosters are consistently abused
AS12876, FR AS14618 Amazon AWS and more Some IPs are actively hosting thousands of domains for months
 Some hosters are highly infested with shady, toxic content; dedicated?
AS202023, LLHOST, RO; phishing, tech support scams, fake updates, porn
40

Who is querying these domains?
 Take 1 week's worth of detections; Jan 1-7 and user IPs
 10 busiest hours
20000+ user IPs querying 2000+ malvertising domains
 Some top talker clusters emerge
Security companies owned ranges querying hundreds of domains Some rogue networks querying hundreds of domains
