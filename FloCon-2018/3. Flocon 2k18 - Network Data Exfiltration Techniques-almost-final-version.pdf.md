About me
 VP, Cyber Security @ Collective-Sense.com  IT Security Architect and Founder @ Defensive-Security.com  Author of "Open Source Defensive Security" Training  Trainer at OWASP Appsec USA, Brucon, Confidence, ISSA and many others  Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)  Red Hat Certified Architect / RHCSS / RHCX / Splunk Architect  Member of ISSA/OWASP Poland Chapter  Focused on:
 Threat hunting and Incident Response  Linux, Network and Web Application Security  Penetration testing / security audits / OSINT hunting  Hardened IT Infrastructure (SSO/IdM)  Behavioral / statistical analysis  Machine Learning / Deep Learning

What is Data Exfiltration?
 Part of post exploitation process  Unauthorized copying, transfer or retrieval of data from a computer or
server  Malicious activity performed through various different techniques,
typically by cybercriminals over the Internet or other network  Data theft, data exportation  There is no single silver bullet solution to detect it:
 Defense in Depth

Defense in depth
 Strategy of having layered security mechanisms:  if one fails, the other may still provide a protection  Network segmentation + deep network traffic analysis + OS device hardening + vulnerability scanning + risk assessments + threat hunting + IR + security culture + experienced team  Questions:  Which layers/devices do your external network packet pass?  Who? When? Where? What? Why? How?

Top Network Protocols for Exfil!
 TCP / UDP / ICMP  HTTP / HTTPS / Websockets:
 XXE / XSS / SQL Injection / RCE
 DNS  SOCKS v4/5  SSH / SCP / SFTP  POP3 / SMTP  RDP  FTP / TFTP  NTP  BGP  WMI  P2P 
VOIP
5
 + Cloud services and many others

Multi-level Network Traffic Analytics
 SPAN / TAP based:  Packet Headers / FPC  Network Protocol Decoders  Signatures
 Routers / switches based:  Flow protocols  Netflow v5/v9, IPFIX
 SNMP polling  Logs  Lists & feeds  IP reputation / malware / phishing lists / coinblocker lists  Data enrichment  GEO / whois / IP-info / VT / GSB / Shodan  Active vulnerability scanning  CVE/MITRE Searcher  Canary tokens  honey traps  deception

ICMP baseline profiling
 ICMP important data:  Connection start/end time + recurrence  SRC / DST IP  Proto name = 1  Total length  ICMP Type  ICMP code  Time To Live  Traffic direction  Number of packets from src/dst to dst/src  Number of bytes from src/dst to dst/src
7

ICMP baseline profiling
 Use-cases:  ICMP tunneling tools:  icmptunnel  meter  icmp_exfil  nping  exfiltrate-data.rb  icmpsh / hans  DET

TCP/UDP baseline profiling per device
 Few examples of TCP / UDP security features:
 Proto name = 6 / 17  SRC / DST IP  SRC / DST port  Connection start / end time  keep-alive heartbeat  Number of SYN / FIN / ACK / PSH / URG / FIN packets  Number of sequence packets  Number of retransmitted packets  Number of TCP header flags  Number of Fragmented packets  Flow ID  Traffic direction

TCP/UDP baseline profiling per device

 Use-cases:

 stratum+TCP  JSON over TCP sockets

 udp2raw tunnel

 SSH/* over 53/tcp:

 DNS decoder is blind

 sg1:

 swiss army knife for data encryption, exfill and covert communication

 pupy:

 HTTP over HTTP over base64 over HTTP over AES over obfs3

 Meterpreter

 bind / reverse shell:

 upload / download

 pivoting:

 route

DNS baseline profiling per device

 Few examples of DNS security features:

 DNS servers in use

 Transport ratio  UDP vs TCP

 Spikes in DNS byte counts and packet sizes

 "Exotic" DNS request types  DNS TXT/MX Tunneling

 Spikes in DNS NXDomain replies  DGA

 A lot of requests to long/short/random/recently registered domains

 A lot of requests to fast flux domains

 DNS replies have private addresses / patterned encoding

 Packet size outside the normal distribution

 First seen domain name query (ex. on AD Controller)

 Local vs external domain queries

 DNS typosquatting  phishing attempts  Drive By Download

 Shannon Entropy

 Flow ID

DNS baseline profiling
 Use-cases:
 DNS Reverse Shell / DNS tunneling tools:  dnscat2  dnsteal  sqlmap --help | grep -i dns  DET  sg1  XFLTReaT  many others :>
13

HTTP baseline profiling
 It is all about HTTP methods, requests and responses, right?
14

HTTP baseline profiling

 HTTP important data:

 Protocol

 Method

 Hostname

 Request / Response Length

 Request URI

 Response Status

 Headers:

 User Agent

 Referrer

 Cookies

 Traffic type

 Timestamp



DST port / SRC port

15

 Flow ID

HTTP baseline profiling

 Examples of a few HTTP security metrics:

 HTTP traffic to DST IP  without touching DNS + whois/GEO

 non-HTTP traffic on HTTP port  SSL/TLS over HTTP/proxy ports

 HTTP traffic on non-HTTP port

 Number and size of HTTP cookies and other headers:

 Etags/If-None-Match  Wondijna PoC

 Number of log events coming from permissive WAF

 Non-existing HTTP methods in use

 HTTP GET/POST/HEAD Ratio

 Exotic URL patterns

 Uncommon User-Agents

 High volume of bytes for HTTP traffic:

 Strange time frame



Cloud services

HTTP baseline profiling
 Use-cases:
 HTTP tunneling tools:  tuna  trevor C2  DET  RATTE  Merlin  XFLTReaT  Fruity C2  many others:>
17

TLS baseline profiling

 TLS important data:

 CN

L

O

 OU

 ST

C

 Serial Number

 Validity of certificate

 Public key

 Issuer  local PKI?

 Signature Algorithm

 SNI / SAN

 Version

 TLS configuration / TLS vulnerabilities

18

 Flow ID

TLS baseline profiling
 Use cases:  multiple TLS connections with random CA  multiple DGA based domains  self-signed / invalid certs vs valid root CA  Long, random CN, O, OU and others  "Young" certificate (less than 1 month old)  Certificate to IP / IP to certificate  Many, many others:  Meterpreter Paranoid Mode  XSS / SQLi through SSL Certificates:
 L = ">')&#34&#62</stYlE/</title/</sCripT/--!><img src="0:109 "
onerror="function(cookie)...

* baseline profiling
 Ex. based on available Bro Logs we have:  ssh.log, ssl.log, socks.log,traceroute.log, syslog.log, tunnel.log, weird.log  x509.log, smb_mapping.log, smtp.log, snmp.log, signatures.log,  sip.log, software.log, dnp3.log, files.log, ftp.log, http.log, intel.log,  irc.log, app_stats.log, capture_loss.log, dhcp.log, conn.log, dns.log,  conn.log, mysql.log, notice.log, known_services.log, ntlm.log  kerberos.log, known_certs.log, known_devices.log, known_hosts.log,  pe.log, radius.log, rdp.log, rfb.log, smb_cmd.log, smb_files.log
 Bro Analysis Tools (BAT)  processing and analysing of Bro data with:  Pandas  Scikit-learn  Spark

Anomaly Detection / ML
 Supervised models:
 Support Vector Machines (SVM)  Replicator neural networks  Bayesian networks  Unsupervised:  K-Means Clustering  Statistical:  Dynamic/adaptive thresholding  Time / period series:  ARIMA  Holt Winters  SVR  Deep Learning models
21

AI-based Active Response
 Full Packet Capture for suspicious events  Radius COA Integration  ex. VLAN enforcement  Cisco ISE Integration  ex. block MAC address  LDAP/AD Integration  ex. logout action  Firewall Integration  ex. block IP address  Notifications  ex. email
22

Summary
 Constant Proactive Threat Hunting  Incident Response Strategy Validation
 Red vs blue teaming  offensive vs defensive actions  Get a new knowledge every single day!
 Show me the change in the device behavior! :  Full network visibility:  You_name_it_network events + log events + data enrichment  Alert drill down for getting access to raw data results
