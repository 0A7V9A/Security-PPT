Threat Hunting

· Assume the perimeter defense is not
sufficient to keep threats out 

· Zero-day Exploits

· Advanced Persistent Threat

· Etc.

· Need to systematically search and analyze
threats within the network

Statistical Anomaly Detection

· The Z-score is commonly used
for anomaly detection in 1 dimension

xµ Z=

-2 Std. Dev. -1 Std. Dev.

( -2 )

Multi-Dimensional Anomaly Detection

· Extends the Z-score to multiple
dimensions 


· Several available techniques (both
parametric and non-parametric):


· Local Outlier Factor


· Isolation Forest


· Robust Covariance


· Leads to improved ability to detect outliers
in network traffic

Bake-Off

· We evaluated the approaches on net flows from 13
scenarios collected in a lab environment where the ground truth was known

· Range in size from ~100k to ~5m flows

· Most scenarios have between ~0.5% malicious
and 2% malicious. 3 scenarios are closer to 9% malicious

Creating Dimensions

· Use 1-d anomaly scores for numerical values
 · Percentage of overall traffic to/from an IP
 · Percentage of traffic using a particular protocol or port grouped by Source
and Destination IP

· Anything else you can compute!

Evaluation Criteria

· Minimum rank of all malicious flows (Lower)
 · Evaluates how quickly the first flow shows up

· Precision at 1000 (Higher)
 · Evaluates effort at a small workload

· Precision at 10000 (Higher)
 · Evaluates effort at a larger workload

· Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) (Higher)
 · Evaluates ranking across the entire scenario

Number of Wins

· The table shows the
number of scenarios in which each algorithm had the best result

· Overall, Local Outlier
Factor placed the most malicious flows near the top of the list 

· However, Isolation
Forest produced the lowest variance overall

Number of Threats Identified (n=10000)

· Local Outlier Factor (LOF) performed
many multiples better than than the alternatives in 12 of 13 scenarios

· We considered two baselines:

· Baseline 1: Random
· How many malicious flows
would you find by chance alone in a sample of 1000 flows?

· Baseline 2: Next Best
· The best performer of Spot,
Packets, Bytes, and Duration?

Summary

· Machine Learning is an ideal threat hunting tool for an analyst

· But it must be trained with the analyst workflow and deployment
in mind

· Multi-dimensional anomaly detection techniques provides a
powerful approach for threat hunting using multiple kinds of features, leading to improved detection of possible threats

CounterFlow AI enables security analysts to hunt more effectively by introducing the next generation of network security sensors. Operating at the tip of the spear, CounterFlow sensors are designed to target threats at wire-speed. The sensors integrate signature-inspection, threat intelligence, and streaming analytics with machine learning to detect known and zero-day attacks, significantly reduce false positives, and drive security automation.
Dr. Andrew Fast is the Chief Data Scientist and co-founder of CounterFlow AI. Previously, he served as the Chief Scientist at Elder Research, Inc., a leading data science consulting firm, where he helped hundreds of companies expand their data science capabilities. Dr. Fast is a frequent author, teacher, and invited speaker on data science topics. In 2012, he coauthored a book titled Practical Text Mining that was published by Elsevier and won the PROSE Award for top book in the field of Computing and Information Sciences for that year. His work analyzing NFL coaching trees was featured on ESPN.com in 2009.

Dr. Fast received Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a B.S. in Computer Science from Bethel University.
