Advanced Persistent Threats

· Often associated with nation-state espionage

· Targets include private organizations & nationstates

· Low and Slow: Attack campaigns may last months

· Notoriously difficult to detect

(Preprint: A. Lemay, et al. 2018)

Alert Graphs

· Graph of alerts (Not network topology)
· Alert properties become nodes
· Colors indicate layers (property type)
· Edges connect nodes that co-occur in alerts
· Edges are weighted by frequency of cooccurrence

Hurricane Panda Attack

· Cyber attacks change IDS alert logs
· Intuition
­ Changes in alert logs modify alert graph
­ Anomalies in the graph features (properties) may indicate cyber attacks
· Quick test
­ Degree of IP nodes shows marked changes during simulated attack
­ But a single feature is likely insufficient
­ What features should we track?
­ Should we model all features for anomalies?

Role Dynamics

· Infeasible to model every feature of every node
· Instead, use graph-based anomaly detection algorithms
· Role dynamics (Rossi et al., 2012)
­ Collect features and factorize as roles
­ Roles provide a succinct, integrated summary across a large number of features
­ Output is probability of membership in each role, for each node
­ Application to IDS alerts is novel
­ Track role memberships over time

Finding Role Anomalies

· Role anomalies
­ Now we have roles over time for all nodes in graph
­ How to identify anomalies in the roles?
· Aggregate changes into a few useful metrics
­ For example, average magnitude of the rate of change in role membership: =1   -   - 1 /
­ Monitor metrics for anomalies
