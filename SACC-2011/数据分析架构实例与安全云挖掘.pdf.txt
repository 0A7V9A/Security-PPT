Why Mine Data? Commercial Viewpoint
Lots of data is being collected and warehoused
 Web data, e-commerce  purchases at department/
grocery stores  Bank/Credit Card
transactions
Computers have become cheaper and more powerful
Competitive Pressure is Strong
 Provide better, customized services for an edgSeA(eC.gC. in2011
Customer Relationship Management)

Why Mine Data? Scientific Viewpoint

Data collected and stored at enormous speeds (GB/hour)
 remote sensors on a satellite  telescopes scanning the skies  microarrays generating gene
expression data
Traditional techniques infeasible for

raw data Data mining may help scientists
 in classifying and segmenting data  in Hypothesis Formation

SACC2011

Mining Large Data Sets - Motivation

There is often information "hidden" in the data that is not readily evident

Human analysts may take weeks to discover useful information

Much of the data is never analyzed at all

What is Data Mining?
Many Definitions
 Non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data
 Exploration & analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns
SACC2011

What is (not) Data Mining?

l What is not Data l What is Data Mining? Mining?

­ Look up phone number in phone directory
­ Query a Web search engine for information about "Amazon"

­ Certain names are more prevalent in certain US locations (O'Brien, O'Rurke, O'Reilly... in Boston area)
­ Group together similar documents returned by search engine according to their context (e.g. Amazon rainforest, Amazon.com,)
SACC2011

Origins of Data Mining

Draws ideas from machine learning/AI,

pattern recognition, statistics, and database systems

Traditional Techniques may be unsuitable due to
 Enormity of data
 High dimensionality of data
 Heterogeneous, distributed nature of data

Nearest Neighbor Classifiers
Basic idea:
 If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck

Compute Distance

Test Record

Training Records

Choose k of the "nearest" records
SACC2011

Nearest-Neighbor Classifiers

Unknown record

l Requires three things
­ The set of stored records
­ Distance Metric to compute distance between records
­ The value of k, the number of nearest neighbors to retrieve

l To classify an unknown record:
­ Compute distance to other training records
­ Identify k nearest neighbors
­ Use class labels of nearest neighbors to determine the class label of unknown record (e.g., by taking majority vote)
SACC2011

Definition of Nearest Neighbor

X

X

X

(a) 1-nearest neighbor (b) 2-nearest neighbor (c) 3-nearest neighbor
K-nearest neighbors of a record x are data points that have the k smallest distance to x
