Melissa Misuraca

The session will provide tips on how security awareness professionals can implement personal, simple, and relevant activities virtually to engage employees.
'Your Digital Footprint: What it is and how to manage it'
In this session we will spend a few minutes on each of the topics
What do youbelotw hink you need for · Pivoting from face to face to virtual awareness effective cyber security? · Ways to help employees reduce their digital footprint with a `digital footprint' exercise (a pivot from a face to face `cyber health check event')

Background

· In the digital age, and particularly during the pandemic, many of us spent hours every day on devices.
· Many of us had to pivot our face-to-face programs to virtual delivery.
· Cyber security risks and issues can appear at any time and sometimes the symptoms aren't always obvious.
· During the pandemic, employees were also grappling with this `new normal' which made engagement all that more difficult.

How do I get to Cyber Security awareness nirvana?

Building effective cyber security awareness via virtual channels
Keep it simple and personal "what's in it for me?"

Digital Footprints
By tracking our online behaviour, cyber criminals can learn more about us, which might lead to identity theft or social engineering.
In this session we will:
· Be challenged to look at our own digital footprint in a practical exercise in the session and;
· Look at ways to reduce our digital footprint.

What's a Digital Footprint?

· Your digital footprint is what you leave behind as you use the Internet.
· Comments on social media, apps, website searches and email records or registrations.
· It's part of your online history and can potentially be seen by other people or tracked in a database.
· Other people may contribute to this footprint, too.

Have you ever checked your digital footprint?
Investigating yourself on the internet can be a very useful way to see what's already out there about you and make decisions for the future....

Be aware of what you share We're going to do a quick activity- check your digital footprint. In the next 5 minutes we will each run a search and then we'll regroup to discuss the results. Grab your phones and open your browser of choice and go into incognito or the private tab version so that your current log ins don't skew your results.
Examine your own digital footprint

I don't bake so this must be another Melissa Misuraca

In the media
· Events I have attended or presented at. · Website news stories I have written · Award nominations · All with my consent (tick)
· You will note general disclaimers at events and conferences about media and marketing. This is to reduce the need for 1:1 consent which isn't always possible / practical to obtain in large numbers.

Takeaways
Most of us will have digital footprint.
Once digital traces are created, they usually leave our immediate control. Encourage employees to think before they post images or content or use online services or social media tools. Read and understand privacy policies.
Reduce your digital footprint where possible ­ ask to be removed from marketing lists, tighten up privacy settings on Social Media.

Make it part of your corporate DNA
· Encourage participants to report anything that doesn't look right at a corporate level, at the close of the session.
· In a session I ran previously, a participants highlighted a fake `conference' website using the organisation's brand and logo.

Close the session with a poll What do employees want to learn about in the next virtual session?
Feedback

Your Security Team is Everyone
Security Culture is the ideas, customs and social behaviours of a group of people, that impacts their security.
So making your awareness program as simple, relevant and attractive to a diverse audience is key
