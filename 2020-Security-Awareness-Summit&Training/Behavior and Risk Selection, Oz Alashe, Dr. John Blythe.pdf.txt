Why are interventions failing?
 Message fatigue  Fear and scare tactics  Scatter gun approach  Lack of meaningful metrics  Interventions not addressing the
right barriers

Why are interventions failing?

Understanding behaviours

What is the problem?

What are the relevant
behaviours?

What is influencing the target behaviour?

Behavioural Risks
The behavioural problem
Being specific about:  What risks you are tackling  The mitigating behaviour(s)  The target individual or group

Malware Infection

Data Leak

Fraud & Identity Theft

Prioritising Behaviours
Primary Criteria 1. Impact (on security risks) 2. Likelihood of change
Supporting criteria 1. Behavioural spillover 2. Suitability 3. Ease of measurement

 Co-designed & continually developed.
 Academic literature review.  Reference to guidance and
standards, published by NCSC, ISO & others.  SebDB panel of academic, government and industry experts.  Iteratively designed.

What the community are saying?

"Using SebDB as a way to help us make sure it's up to date and relevant for our planning of next years awareness offering. Having one place to see all the behaviours does help focus the mind".

"I really like the community aspect".

"I like how it includes physical risks, as well as, cyber as some CISOs don't consider the physical side".

"The body of knowledge is fantastic...".
