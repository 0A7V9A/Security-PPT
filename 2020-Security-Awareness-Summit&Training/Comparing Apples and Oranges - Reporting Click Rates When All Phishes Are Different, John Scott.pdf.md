Oh ... and ...

So ...
Metrics for CISO + Need for thesis subject + Dissatisfaction with click rate as a stat = An idea!

The Idea
· Create 10 phishing emails of different levels of sophistication
· Ask Security Awareness professionals to rate them
· Run those phishes against my organisation to compare the ratings

Stage 1: 10 Phishes

Phish 01 Phish 02 Phish 03 Phish 04 Phish 05 Phish 06 Phish 07 Phish 08 Phish 09 Phish 10

SIMPLE Urgent help needed SIMPLE Governor Request BASIC Check CV BASIC Contact Info INTERMEDIATE Secure email INTERMEDIATE Compromised Account DIFFICULT discussed link DIFFICULT Spam mail removal COMPLEX GDPR Breach COMPLEX Information Leak

Stage 2: The Wisdom of the Crowds
· 2 stage process:
­ Assess each phish by `gut reaction' ­ 1-5
· "Would this work in my organisation?'
­ Assess each phish on 5 psychological triggers

Stage 2: 5 psychological triggers
· Authority · Curiosity · Punishment or reward · Time pressure · Specificity

Stage 3: test the phishes live
· Run against my own organisation
­ 5500 people, so roughly 550 people per phish ­ Run 3 times to different groups each time (July,
October, January) ­ Get an average susceptibility per phish

Stage 4: Analysis
· Do the assessments carried out in stage 2 match the actual phishes in stage 4?
· Does it make a difference if the person doing the assessment in stage 2 works in Security Awareness?

So, did it work? ... kinda ....

3 takeways
· Gut feel is important, but not just your own gut feel.
· Running the same phishes against a different organisation would be interesting
· If this doesn't work, how do we measure the different susceptibility levels?
