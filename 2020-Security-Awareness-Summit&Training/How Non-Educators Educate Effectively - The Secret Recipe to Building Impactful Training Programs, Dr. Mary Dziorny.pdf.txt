Bridging the Gap
Why Instructional Design Matters Creating effective learning experiences is complicated. There are many widely implemented learning practices that are little more than myths. Not surprisingly most formal learning experiences are incredibly inefficient. Instructional design models provide frameworks to facilitate gaining new knowledge, skills or attitudes. Instructional designers use these models to guide the creation of engaging learning activities based on the science of how people learn.

9 Events of Instruction- Gagne' & Briggs

1. Gaining attention (reception)

show variety of computer-generated triangles

2. Informing learners of the objective (expectancy) pose question: "What is an equilateral triangle?"

3. Stimulating recall of prior learning (retrieval)

review definitions of triangles

4. Presenting the stimulus (selective perception) give definition of equilateral triangle

5. Providing learning guidance (semantic encoding) show example of how to create equilateral

6. Eliciting performance (responding)

ask students to create 5 different examples

7. Providing feedback (reinforcement)

check all examples as correct/incorrect

8. Assessing performance (retrieval)

provide scores and remediation

9. Enhancing retention and transfer (generalization) show pictures of objects and ask students to
identify equilaterals

Let's try it out!

1. Think of a training presentation
or other activity you are trying to design in your own program.
2. Jot down some ideas for each of
the 9 Events of Instruction.
3. In a moment, we'll share our
ideas in the Slack channel.

1. Gain attention ­ show variety of computer-generated triangles 2. Identify objective ­ pose question: "What is an equilateral
triangle?"
3. Recall prior learning ­ review definitions of triangles 4. Present stimulus ­ give definition of equilateral triangle 5. Guide learning- show example of how to create equilateral 6. Elicit performance ­ ask students to create 5 different examples 7. Provide feedback ­ check all examples as correct/incorrect 8. Assess performance- provide scores and remediation 9. Enhance retention/transfer ­ show pictures of objects and ask
students to identify equilaterals
