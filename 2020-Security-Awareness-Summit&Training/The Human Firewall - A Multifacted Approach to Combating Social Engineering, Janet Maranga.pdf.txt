GOAL
Inform: How Social Engineering Works Persuade: User Education doesn't address SE tactics Persuade: Best practices to institutionalize

SOCIAL ENGINEERING LIFECYCLE

HUMAN VULNERABILITIES
How Social Engineering attacks work

RECIPROCITY

SCARCITY

USER EDUCATION
Doesn't change Human Nature

USER EDUCATION
q Cannot cover every case q Does not "Solve" Reciprocity,
Trust, Familiarity, Scarcity and Authority q Fades after about 6 months q Treats each situation with context

CONCLUSION
q Measures covered will help you to mitigate attempts to trick and cajole you or your staff into revealing data
q None of them stands alone
q Protecting against the sophisticated tactics of cybercriminals to prevent social engineering attacks is a process.
q When the human element of behavior manipulation is added via social engineering this process can have many moving parts
q Human-centric security as well as technological approaches such as 2FA
q A multi-faceted socio-technological approach against social engineering has to be institutionalized to prevent successful SE attacks.

THANK YOU!
