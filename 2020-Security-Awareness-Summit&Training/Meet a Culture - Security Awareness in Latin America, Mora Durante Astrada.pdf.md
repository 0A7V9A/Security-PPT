Who am I... and Why am I talking on this topic?

Security Awareness Consultant,

LatAm Lead

· Member of a global, 4-person team.

· Been doing Security Awareness in Latin America for 6 years.

· In 2019, joined the global team and have a combined global & regional role.

Tell me something I don't know...

· Work with six countries in the region: ARG, BRA, CHL, COL, ECU, MEX.
If you think just because you are a global company, your global security awareness program will naturally cascade and be embraced / implemented in LatAm, you are in for a rude awakening...

Security Awareness in LatAm
One size does not fit all
But wouldn't it be fantastic if it did?
· There is no magic, one size fits all solution. · A Global Program is required in a global company, BUT it must
be tailored to local needs -including local languages. · You need a regional expert in the field. · Local support is a must. Sponsorship even better! · Think outside the box. · Know your audience. Know your stakeholders. Make allies!

Mi casa es su casa
... Or not!
· English - the universal language, but not the mother tongue in Latin America.
· Translate! Translate! Translate! ­no; Google Translate or Duolingo will not cut it!
· Be mindful of idioms or dialects. Words have specific meanings to each location.

I want you to want to wash the dishes
i.e. Teamwork
· Global initiatives must show local value or they're just another item checked off a To Do list.
· Information Security colleagues are your friends! · Comms employees are your friends! · "Sell" your product. · Answer the "What's in it for me?" WIIFM
question ;) · Know who makes things happen, and make allies
of them.

Lateral thinking much?
Or the art of being flexible
· People in LatAm are hardworking and resourceful. They are also very social and take pride in their personal time.
· In the workplace, · Lunch with colleagues · A quick coffee break to both chat and get some work done
ALL elements to factor in when embarking on a Security Awareness journey in the region.
How on earth do things get done, then?

Key Takeaways
· One size does not fit all. Ensure you adapt the global program to fit the region and /or countries' local needs.
· Translate. Translate. Translate! People want content in their own languages. · Build partnerships. Strengthen your connections, for a higher chance of reception / implementation.
Strategize together. · Have someone on the field. Based in the region, who speaks its languages and knows the culture(s) · Be flexible and adapt. Think outside the box; LatAm has many variables that make it unique (e.g.
political unrest; "don't tell me what to do")
