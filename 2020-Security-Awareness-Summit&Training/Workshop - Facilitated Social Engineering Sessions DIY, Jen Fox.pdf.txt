Humans are ... human
· Emotions can be used to trick us
­ Urgency ­ Fear ­ Heartstrings for others ­ Curiosity ­ Wanting to be included
· We are better at detecting truth than lies
­ "Truth Default Theory"

Are there enough red flags...

Social engineering is an organized process...

Analysis

We do our homework
· Timeliness · Credibility · Language

Pretexts are engineered for...
· Probability ­
­ Not everyone has to "bite"
· The most effective pretexts are the ones that have the best odds of working.
· Forgettability ­
­ Requests or pretexts are often mundane or behave in a way that we can shrug off as a simple error
· It's easy for us to believe we've simply mis-keyed something or that a site isn't working properly

United Hope
...Does Frank sound convinced? ...Why does he answer my question?

Portals

Collect credentials without directly asking for them
· Payroll · Charity · Intranet

Meanwhile, back at United Hope...
...Does Frank sound suspicious this time? ...Why or why not?

What does resistance sound like?

In conclusion
· Social engineering techniques are becoming increasingly subtle and difficult to detect
· When you do detect that something is amiss, it can still be difficult to resist
· Know who to contact, and how

GROUP EXERCISE!

Research...
· Company site · Inappropriately exposed docs · Vendor case studies · News

What's your angle?
· Probability · Forgettability · Curiosity

Group Exercise
· Group up! · Look at the "research" packets
­ What does the information there tell you?
· What would your approach be to:
­ Get login information (ID & Password) ­ Have someone download a "document" ­ Bonus: Get access to someone's computer

HOW-TO

Why do this?
· Helps people gain a more concrete understanding of how SE attacks work
· Demonstrates the low bar for certain attacks

What to focus on?
· What are the concerns for your org/industry? · What do you want to accomplish?

Research
· Job postings · Social media posts · LinkedIn postings · Company news / press releases

Variations
· Research focus · Focus on one vector (in-person, phone, etc.) · Focus on one pretext (story approach)

Rules of Engagement
If you want to do more than a thought experiment:
· Who/what/where is off-limits? · Who needs to know in advance? · How do you handle different outcomes
(success or getting `caught')? · Never do anything illegal, no matter who
gives you permission
