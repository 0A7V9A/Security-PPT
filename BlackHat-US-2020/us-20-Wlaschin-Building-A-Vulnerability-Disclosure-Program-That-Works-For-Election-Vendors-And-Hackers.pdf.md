Crowdsourced Pen Testing at the State Level
"The State of Colorado considers considers pen testing, and Synack's crowdsourced pen testing specifically, as a crucial part of a cybersecurity program."

Example #1
Citrix NetScaler

Researcher Jack Cable

Vulnerability

Citrix NetScaler VPN appliance susceptible to malware CVE-2019-19781 - Discovered by Synack SRT member in Dec 2019 - Malicious file upload leads to full compromise of devices - How long was this known by the adversary?

Methodology

Make a request to `GET /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf` (note that this should be done in a proxy such as Burp Suite in order to execute the raw request).
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Example #1
Citrix NetScaler

Evaluation

Directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the pathname. Lacking a data sanitation check the system uses the path in incoming requests directly. Requests containing a path like /vane/../vpns/services.html, are transformed into simply /vpns/. This vulnerability in the system could allow remote attackers to exploit directory traversal requests and access sensitive files without the need for user authentication.

Mitigation

Apply a specific responder policy to filter exploitation attempts.

Example #3
Zebra Scanners

Researchers Kevin Skoglund, Tony Adams

Vulnerability Zebra scanners/printers shipped from OEM with unrestricted end-user access to front panel options. CVE-2019-10960

Methodology

In-depth review of EAC certification test plans for ES&S certification documentation lists COTS Hardware which includes: "Zebra Technologies, QR code scanner (Integrated), DS457-SR20009.

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Example #3
Zebra Scanners

Evaluation Mitigation

Configuration barcodes are special, manufacturer-defined barcodes which can be scanned by a scanner to change:
- Scanner's settings - Types of barcodes the scanner reads - How it reads barcodes - How it processes barcodes

ES&S' use of the Zebra devices includes Skoglund's recommendation that voting system software should:

- Thoroughly sanitize all data received via a barcode scanner to prevent code injection

- Consider and securely handle all input, even unexpected commands

Example #4
VoterView Look
Researcher Hunter Osmera Vulnerability VoterView application responds to random character input in name
fields returning voter directory information Methodology Manual and bot-based random character injection into the data fields
of the voter lookup website
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Example #4
VoterView Look

Evaluation

Special characters are being ignored by the search parameter and the application is treating the subsequent blank first name and blank last name as not part of the search, then using only the date of birth as the search criteria, thus returning multiple voters with the same birthdate.

Mitigation

Software updated to prevent exploitation of random character injections by disallowing special characters that are unlikely to appear in names.

Secure the Election
Security by America for America
The best security is rooted in a united effort. Synack's Secure the Election initiative provides pro bono crowdsourced security testing and vulnerability disclosure programs to states prior to the 2020 Presidential Election. Synack believes that hackers can provide an adversarial perspective on where states are vulnerable. A "see something, see say something" policy as well as rigorous crowdsourced pentesting are best practices and will deter future attacks. Services include:
· Which servers are connected to the internet? · Do online voter registration sites connect to the VRDB? · Can admin access be gained? Can accounts be edited? · Can the VRDB be accessed through a 3rd party system?
The Result: finding & fixing vulnerabilities before exploitation

The Future of Electronic Security & Elections: FETT Bug Bounty with DARPA, DDS, and Synack

DARPA FETT (Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering)
· DARPA is hosting the Finding Exploits to Thwart Tampering (FETT) Bug Bounty ­ a
crowdsourced pentesting exercise that aims to evaluate the hardware architectures in development on the SSITH program with the goal of uncovering and addressing potential bugs and vulnerabilities.

DARPA is doing research on how to harden electronic systems
including, including VRD
· Voter registration systems are something that each U.S. county and state must stand-up on
their own. There are few, if any, standards guiding these systems and they utilize the same web servers and database back-ends as many other internet-enabled systems.
· DARPA felt that the SSITH hardware defenses could help protect these systems from certain
attacks and believe the issue to be increasingly urgent.

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Specific Software Vulns that Create Issues in Hardware (Source: DARPA)
DARPA has focused on security research to protect against the following vulnerability classes that occur in electronic systems, including Voter Registration Databases (VRD):
· Buffer errors · Information leakage · Permissions, Privileges, Access Control · Numeric errors · Resource management · Code Injection · Crypto Errors
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Next Steps
The IT-ISAC EI-SIG has formed an Advisory Committee on Coordinated Vuln Disclosure (CVD) which is driving toward industry-wide VDP.
ES&S is partnering with Synack to test its newest generation pollbook.

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Next Steps
The Federal Testing Program needs tweaking to allow for quick testing.
· Testing timelines are currently too elongated for a full CVDP · Incorporation into federal certification standards
Customers (state and local election officials) benefit
· Increased confidence in systems and software · Public awareness improves overall impression of election tech

Supply Chain Security Considerations

ES&S Product Life Cycle
Sustainability & Supply Chain Security

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Supply Chain Security Considerations
· As is the case with many critical infrastructure sectors, ES&S has certain global supply chain dependencies.
· ES&S' Engineering Team continually reviews the ability to source components within the U.S. Some components are:
§ Sole-sourced § Protected by a patent § Intricate to the design of the circuit or sub-assembly § Not able to be procured from alternative suppliers
· ES&S' experts evaluate the risk and impact of using those components and assess safeguards to limit risk when using sensitive components.
· Every aspect of our system is under a secure Engineering Change Order (ECO) control process, regardless of where individual components are produced.
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Supply Chain Security Considerations
ES&S conducts thorough security reviews of its supply chain to ensure every component is trusted, tested and free of defects, including:
· Risk assessments using NIST
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) tools
· On-site visits to suppliers

#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Supply Chain Security Considerations
· These audits utilize both on-site quality teams, as well as site visits to confirm that contract manufacturers are following prescribed processes.
· ES&S contract manufacturers' procurement and supplier oversight policies are thoroughly vetted by ES&S to ensure they meet the established requirements.
#BHUSA @BLACKHATEVENTS

Supply Chain Integrity
Once the hardware components are delivered to Omaha, ES&S performs several essential steps, including:
· Verification that the firmware on the PLDs within the hardware is exactly what it is expected it to be and not altered in any way
· Final hardware configuration · Final end-to-end QC test which includes loading of the certified
software and firmware
