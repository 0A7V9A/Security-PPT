· Chit-chat (CAT - I) · Historical (CAT ­ II)
· "Can I come to your house today" · "Shall we meet tomorrow" · "Are you coming for the X meetup tomorrow" · Topical, factual, asking for specific information (CAT - III) · How is the weather today? · What is SQLi · Pure generative, philosophical, anything else aka free flow chat (CAT ­ IV) · What is love · What is the purpose of life etc.

User

Does money buy happiness?

Bot

Depends how much money you spend on it .

User

What is the best way to buy happiness ?

Bot

You just have to be a millionaire by your early 20s, then you can be happy .

User

This is so difficult !

Bot

You have no idea how hard it is to be a millionaire and happy . There is a reason the rich have a lot of money

Road Ahead
· Add expressions to voice and video using sentiment analysis of the questions asked and the answers generated by the AI
· Use VoIP phone number to make fake calls to victim's friend and do social engineering
· Bypass voice recognition and voice-based OTP using the Voice Engine
· Bypass facial recognition and live detection techniques like visual OTP, lip reading etc. using Video Engine

Vision: create futuristic technologies

Looking for angels to support us to build futuristic technologies
· Behavioral Analysis · Conversational AI · Bot detections and other kind of
preventive frameworks
