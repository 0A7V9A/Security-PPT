What are mental models?
Mental models describe how a user thinks about a problem; it is the model in the person's mind of how things work. People use these models to make decisions about the effects of various actions [1].
It helps to understand how users make security decisions, and to characterize the security problems that result from these decisions [2].

Why do (incorrect) mental models matter?
People perceive E2EE incorrectly in both directions [1-2]:  Encryption protects from anything  Encryption can be trivially broken by anyone who works in IT

Feeds Into Study 2
???  Can we shift user mental model on E2EE with short messages
in text?  How much is lost in short, medium vs. long messages?
 Long: App's info webpage, complete coverage of things we want to convey
 Short: Messages during loading, tooltips etc., concise single talking point
 Medium: "Click here for more" in app, etc.
 Which short, medium messages are most effective (for what)?
 Don't want to oversell security
36

 Online study via a crowdsourcing platform (Prolific, n=461)  1 Long, 5 short, 2 medium, 1 control message
 Hypothetical app called TextLight (to remove brand bias)  Between subjects design  Quiz before, read message, quiz after
 Quiz asks about adversaries and their capabilities  Measure change in scores
37

38

Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. This ensures that only you and the person you're communicating with can read the messages you send and receive. Nobody in between can see the content of your messages.

Messages in TextLight are end-to-end encrypted. Before a message ever leaves your device, it's secured with a lock, and only you and your recipients have the keys to open the message and read it.

Study 2: Results Highlights
 Long message is generally better than control
58

Mediums?
 Mostly better than control  Mostly not worse than long
59

Short messages?
 Similar case to mids
60

Short messages?
 Similar case to mids  Some perform better than
others generally
 Only you and the recipient  Lock/Key work
61

Shorts messages?
 When message is topical,
mostly better than all messages
62

Shorts messages?
 When message is topical,
mostly better than all messages
 But, some additional risk of
overcorrecting!
63

 The messages work! (in a controlled environment)  Short messages work surprisingly well
 Can be shown one by one to not overwhelm  Form a complete mental model

· Employee and government shift in the right direction

83

We interviewed 19/32 experimental participants
 10/19 participants were able to generalize the concept
 " [it protects from] Probably anyone who would interrupt or interfere in between the messaging, in between where you sent it and someone else received it."
 14/19 knew the unlocked phone adversary was powerful  9/19 participants got at least something wrong about E2EE
 " [it protects from] people ... hacking into your phone ... from either reading the messages or altering the contents of the message."
 9/19 said they didn't read the messages or weren't interested in them.
 "I obviously didn't pay a lot of attention to it."
84

 No statistically significant changes in mental models, but;
 The strongest effects seen in study 2 show themselves  There is some overselling  Some had decent mental models when interviewed
 The messages might have to be made more obvious
 Even if it sacrifices some usability.  Some users simply ignored the messages
85

Questions?
 Mental models of secure communication: not functional enough  Can small nudges and user-centered design improve things?
 Initial qualitative study to identify topics, messages  Online study to examine specific messages  Longitudinal study to measure real-world effectiveness
We identify key items to teach users. They work well when we control external factors. Integration to applications might need to be more obvious.
 Perhaps by sacrificing usability a little bit.
