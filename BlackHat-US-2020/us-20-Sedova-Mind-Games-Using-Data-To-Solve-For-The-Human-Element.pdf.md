This talk will demonstrate how security teams can use their data to:  Explore the efficacy of accepted best
practices.  Know where to look for human risk.  Explore a menu of effective remediation
techniques.

How does training impact phishing resilience?

The study: Researchers sent 3 spear phishing emails that claimed to have relevant information to 1,500 employees over a few months.
Hypothesis: If users are provided with training immediately following an error in judgment, they will be less likely to make the same error when presented again with a similar judgment.
Expected results: 1. A lower rate of clicking spear phishing links 2. An increase in reporting suspicious emails

Control group notification

Post-compromise training

Results

1) All or none: Many employees either clicked all the links or not at all across multiple emails.
2) Initial results foreshadowed future performance: Employees who clicked an initial spear phishing email were more likely to click subsequent spear phishing emails; those who didn't click an initial spear phishing email were less likely to click subsequent spear phishing emails.
3) Training didn't matter: Being given training had no significant effect on the likelihood that a participant would click a subsequent spear phishing email.
4) Skipping the content: Almost every employee ignored the training materials.

How do we design more effective interventions?

Knowing Isn't
Enough

Motivation

3 elements are required for behavior change

Motivation Hack #1
Social Proof

The power of social
proof

Control
Keep Your Account Safe You can use security settings to protect your account and make sure it can be recovered if you ever lose access.

Social proof in security

Social context
Keep Your Account Safe 108 of your friends use extra security settings. You can also protect your account and make sure it can be recovered if you ever lose access.

1.36x more successful when using social proof

Using social proof

Motivation Hack #2
Gamification

Gamification

It's Not About Playing Games at Work

Gamification is the use of Game Mechanics in Non-Gaming environments to improve
Engagement, Motivation and Business Results

Gamification principles
AUTONOMY | We Like Having Choices MASTERY | We Like to Get Better at What We Do FEEDBACK | We Like Getting Feedback on our Progress PURPOSE | Meaning Amplifies What We Do SOCIAL | All This Means More With Others

Motivation Hack #3

Reinforcement in Phishing
Negative reinforcement
"You clicked on a link, now take training."

Positive reinforcement
"You detect attacks well and report them quickly. Kudos!"
From: CEO To: All Hands Joe detected and reported a critical phishing attack by doing this.... Kudos!

Punishment can also be an effective tool for improving efficiency and effectiveness, It often has the downside of reducing morale;
On the other hand, verbal positive reinforcement is effective in both increasing the likelihood of desired behavior and encouraging enthusiasm, engagement, and satisfaction among staff.
(Wei & Yazdanifard, 2014).

Changing behaviors by leveraging motivation

Phishing Compromises

Employee Reporting

Password Manager Adoption

Key learnings

Security actions can be predicted based on HR and behavioral data

Tenure was the strongest indicator of phishing resiliency. Employees with the company less than 3 years or more than 16 performed the worst.
Geography was the strongest indicator of likelihood of adopting a password manager.
Late training completion predicted higher click rates and lower reporting rates.

Effective interventions are a combination that address both ability and motivation.

 Leverage motivation to get employees to want to change behaviors and engage in training
 Use techniques like social proof, gamification, and positive reinforcement to achieve behavior change
