Everybody must reduce harm
What do manufacturers do? Try to make stuff that doesn't harm What do security vendors do? Sell stuff intended to reduce harm What do researchers / engineers / practitioners do? Reduce harm What do marketers too often do? Create risk or sensationalize

A real-life use case: Flashpoint
 We partner closely with the "makers" in the company; never use these teams as a personal content repository
 We are besties with the intelligence and research teams; more work but worth it for quality
 We are all challenged to learn and care about security outcomes -- even the non-technical
 We double check with multiple internal folks to ensure all statements are true  No statements include scare tactics  Operational security (OPSEC) is never compromised  Sources are protected  Personas are protected  Investigations are not disrupted

Create a culture shift -- one that benefits everyone
 Speak with your management about creating an ethics or standards board  Express the end state you want is more truth and better security  Share that you are willing to support on a committee to provide guidelines
 Company doesn't have a coordinated disclosure policy? Build one  Ask why; "we are not a security company" is not a good answer  Depending on size of company, talk to management about engaging comms/legal teams
 RequestRequire credit for your work  Research is not better when ghostwritten  Employees are motivated by recognition; it's OK to ask for it  If you're told someone else's name might go on your work because of their "name recognition" -- say no
 Call out marketers, but focus on sharing how to do better vs. focusing just on what sucks
