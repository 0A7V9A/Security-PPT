How Blockchain could help us take back control of our privacy
The Cambridge Analytica breaches show the dangers of leaking personal, sensitive data online ­ but there's a way to avoid this

Bitcoin Transactions Aren't as Anonymous as Everyone Hoped
Web merchants routinely leak data about purchases. And that can make it straightforward to link individuals with their Bitcoin purchases, say cybersecurity researchers.

Hahaha, why don't you just use a database?

Do I need a blockchain?
No

Usually, you can

And sometimes, you could, but there are human reasons why centralized solutions failed to gain traction

And in other cases, we have, but they are inefficient, expensive and/or have failed disastrously

It's not just a database...

:(

It's not just a database...
There is no cloud
It's just someone else's computer

It's not just a database... it's worse

:( :( :(
:(

There is no cloud
It's just someone else's computer

There is no blockchain
It's just all of our computers

And yet...

"Blockchain" means different things to different people

Maybe try listening once in a while?

Businesses are experimenting

Distributed Database:

Mutualized Infrastructure

Public Blockchain:

 Closed, single operator  Trust among nodes  Fast, capable of strong consistency  Store of mutable state  Resiliency & DR assumptions

 Open, multiple operators  Trustless, censorship resistant  Slow, eventually consistent  Log of state transitions  Antifragile

Choose two:

Accessible (Open)

Flexible, Resilient, Performant

Confidential & Secure

Business concerns
 Data privacy  Compliance  Governance  Dispute resolution  Performance  Settlement finality  Resilience

The future is coming... What will it look like?

Blockchain + IoT + AI = Skynet
(and so many consulting white papers)

China

Russia Venezuela

Next-gen encryption wars

Public blockchains are world readable data lakes

Increasingly, the anonymity of a part depends on the motivations & operational security actions of the whole

Businesses need privacy

Share primary records without
 surrendering information ownership to third parties
 creating centralized data lakes

Transition from a perimeter network security model to record level security

Drive adoption of significantly stronger encryption and data privacy standards

"One particularly interesting partnership to highlight is between Ethereum, Zcash, and innovators at JPMorgan."
-Peter Van Valkenberg, CoinCenter Director of Research Testimony to US House Energy & Commerce Committee, 2017

Businesses need privacy

Share primary records without
 surrendering information ownership to third parties
 creating centralized data lakes

Transition from a perimeter network security model to record level security

Drive adoption of significantly stronger encryption and data privacy standards

And real people do, too!

Take your records with you, forever
 Move records between doctors
 Prevent diploma fraud
 Prove your credentials & credit history when you move countries

Monetize your data
 Opt in sharing of personal data with enforceable licensing
 Microtransactions via cryptocurrency
 Secure hardware can bring algos to your data rather than sending data out

Auditing Services:

Otherwise, security be like ¯\_()_/¯

Public:
 Hacked exchanges?  Compromised hardware?  Fake donation scams?  Literal 51% attacks?  Non-mining consensus?  Bespoke crypto schemes?  "Faux decentralization"?  Patch management?  USABLE PRIVACY???

Permissioned:
 Identity & Access mgmt?  Secure hardware as panacea?  Shared governance tools?  Delegated cloud mgmt?  Integration into existing risk
management processes?  Veracity of data oracles?  Patch management?  USABLE PRIVACY???
