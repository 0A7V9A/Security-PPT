Quantum Computing
What does really mean for Security people?
For Excellence in Electronics

Back to our subject
 Quantum Computing ?

 My vision : How to hack the entire IT industry with one particles behavior

 Our agenda for this talk : The journey of a security guy in quantum computing world ... without any PhD

Computing history in 1 slide
 Trust me : Computing's Hardware have already change over the age !

Computer hardware already evolved in past!
 Some People would seem to not accept that there could be a evolution of hardware that supports our « computing" needs... They could be (really) wrong !
 May be it will be Quantum computing, maybe DNA based computing or something else.
 But Computing's hardware could change over the age.

What is Quantum Computing?
 A Quantum computer is a machine that performs calculations bases on the laws of Quantum Mechanics

Investments in the domain are huge

Quantum Computing?

WTF : 1 and 0 @ the same time !?
 How it's possible?
 Duality of wave and particule behavior
 Everythings, @ atomic level could behave as a Wave and a particle?

Wave & Particles behavior experiments (1/3)
 As a IT security consultant / hacker, how to check That ?
 Make , @ home, a double slit experiment ....But with hacker style J
 Step 1 : use a laser point against a wall
 You see a spot !  (photon = particule behaviour)

10

Wave & Particles behavior experiments (2/3)
 Step 2 : send the (same!) laser beam through a double slit

12/04/2018

11

Wave & Particles behavior experiments (3/3)
 Step 2 : You will see an interférence pattern (witch is a wave existance proof )
 Photons behave at the same time as a particules (step 1) and as a wave (Step2) ...
 and this help some guys to design hardware qubit to make a quantum computer : a powerfull new tool for computing !

More Qubit = More Exponential computing power

Quantum Computers: They are coming...

Application?

Quantum Computers & Processors: actual Form factor?

Quantum Computers : New way of programming

What does the code of a quantum computer program look like?
 New type of programming (weird one)
 and completly new way of designing any algorithm (Disconnecting your « classical brain » for a « quantum brain » is hard ...trust me !)
 Juste one example: In Quantum bit world, cloning (=make a simple copy of the value) of a Qbit is not possible (decoherence of quantum state !)

New programming IDE, new logical gate to understand...

Quantum Computers: a threat for security ?

Juste 1 threat example
 Among other things... Classical Crypto defense issue on the rise !

12/04/2018

23

Why ? -> Shor's algorithm

12/04/2018

24

Quantum mecanic could improve our defenses...
 But Quantum mecanics could also help improving  the security defense
 Quantum Cryptography or QKD  Quantum Key Distribution

BB84 protocol will save the world... Or not

12/04/2018

27

How to attack this?
 Spectral attack
 Each polarization state can be created using its own laser photo diode
 For Eve, instead of measuring the polzarization (thus altering the photon state), she can just use spectral analysis to recover the information:
C.K.,P. Zarda, M. Halder, H. Weinfurter

Conclusion
 Quantum Computing is a bit a « disruptive » subject for Security world

 Impacts of this new technology reminds me the result of CyberGrand Challenge where IA code surpass main reverse engineering specialist or pentesters to find and correct vulnerability

 But as usual, This techno will be use for good and evil (be prepared)
