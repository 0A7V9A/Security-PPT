· Introduction on DeTT&CT · New features · Roadmap

MAPPING YOUR BLUE TEAM

Challenge: where do we start our cyber defense efforts
· Intelligence-driven approach with a focus on TTPs

Result in

Data sources

Visibility

Detections

Cyber defense efforts

TTPs

Detect Tactics, Techniques & Combat Threats

· Framework to administrate, score and compare:
· Data source quality · Visibility · Detections · Threat actor behaviours

· Result: where do you focus on
· Which techniques? · Where to improve visibility?

· Scoring tables to guide you

· Administration = YAML files

disclaimer
All shown data and visualisation regarding data quality, visibility, detection and
threat actor groups are based on sample data.

MAPPING YOUR BLUE TEAM

Data sources: what do we log
· Identify data sources
Process injection
· Score data quality (DQ) · Visualise in the ATT&CK Navigator · Export to Excel

Visibility: What can we see?

· Manual score visibility
· Allows you to be exact · One source is more important
than the other · Minimal set of data sources
to have useful visibility
· Administrate in YAML file · Visualise in the ATT&CK Navigator · Export to Excel

957396

Detection: What is our detection coverage?
· Manual score detection · Administrated in the
same YAML file as visibility · Visualise in the ATT&CK Navigator · Export to Excel

GROupS: What are attackers doing?
· Generate heat maps
· Threat actor group data from ATT&CK
· Own intel stored in a group YAML file
· Threat actor data from third parties *1
· Compare threat actors

Legend The technique only present in the group We have some level of detection We have detection and used by the group

New features
· DeTT&CT Editor · Group YAML files with a count per technique · Added support for cloud platforms · EQL integration · Score logbook for keeping track of historic data · Updating visibility scores based on a updated data source admin. file

MAPPING YOUR BLUE TEAM

DeTT&CT Editor
· Editing big YAML files by hand is cumbersome and introduces errors
· Use it online: https://rabobank-cdc.github.io/dettect-editor
· Its fully client side and developed in Vue JS
· Run it locally:
python dettect.py editor

Cloud platforms
· Allow the use of cloud platforms
· Mapping data sources to platforms
· https://github.com/rabobank-cdc/DeTTECT/wiki/Data-sources-per-platform

Endgame's EQL integration in DeTT&CT
· Use EQL to filter your YAML data in DeTT&CT
· Example use case: how did our detection coverage look like X time ago?
python dettect.py d -ft sample-data/techniques-admin.yaml --layer --search-detection "techniques where detection.score_logbook.date < '2017-11-01'" --all-scores
· Only include data sources which can be used in data analytics:
python dettect.py ds -fd sample-data/data-sources-endpoints.yaml -l --search "data_sources where available_for_data_analytics = true"

EQL
· Detection coverage over time

Score logbook

Updating visibility scores
· Update visibility scores (automatically) based on changes in your data sources file · Update when MITRE released a new ATT&CK version

Updating visibility scores
python dettect.py ds -fd ~/Downloads/data-sources-new.yaml -u -ft output/techniques-administrationmyexample-windows.yaml Do you want to fill in the visibility comment for the updated scores?
>> y(yes) / n(no): y >> Visibility comment for in the new 'score' object: Update Q2

Updating visibility scores
The following new technique IDs are added to the technique administration file with a visibility score derived from the nr. of data sources:
- T1192 - T1194 - T1195 - T1534
A total of 1 visibility scores are eligible for an update.
For all most recent visibility score objects that are eligible for an update, the key-value pair 'autogenerated' is set to 'true'. This implies that these scores are auto-generated. How do you want to proceed?:
1) Update all visibility scores that have changed. 2) Decide per visibility score, that has changed if you want to update or not.
Both the current and new visibility score will be printed. 3) Cancel.
