Contextualisation became more and more important as we as a community matured
Growth and diversi cation of our communities Distinguish between information of interest and raw data False-positive management TTPs and aggregate information may be prevalent compared to raw data (risk assessment) Increased data volumes leads to a need to be able to prioritise These help with ltering your TI based on your requirements... ...as highlighted by a great talk from Pasquale Stirparo titled Your Requirements Are Not My Requirements

ATT&CK

Standardising on high-level TTPs was a solution to a long list of issues Adoption was rapid, tools producing ATT&CK data, familiar interface for users A much better take on kill-chain phases in general Feeds into our ltering and situational awareness needs extremely well Gave rise to other, ATT&CK-like systems tackling other concerns
ATT&CK sighting is a standard export format in MISP
