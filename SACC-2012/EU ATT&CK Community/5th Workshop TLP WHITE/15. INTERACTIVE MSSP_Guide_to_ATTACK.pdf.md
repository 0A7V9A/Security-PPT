Agenda
· The problem · So what? · Utilising ATT&CK · What does the customer see? · Kaizen (Continuous improvement) · The result · How do I start?

The problem
· MSSP's have done a poor job helping customers understand:
· Their current risk profile / business context · How they should start addressing these risks · How to measure the effectiveness of their security program

So what?
· Customers see Cyber Security as a 'Black Box' · Making it hard for MSSP's to demonstrate value · Organisations believe "That won't happen to us!" so it lacks focus

Utilising ATT&CK
· Focus our efforts on what 'matters most' to our customers · Validating data ­ increasing confidence of detections · Demystifying 24x7 Security Operations

What does the customer see?

Customers don't need it dumbed down ­ they need context.
Threats common in their industry APT Groups and `modus operandi' TTP's used by APT's

The result
· We can prove we will deliver exactly what we say we will deliver 'No smoke and mirrors'
· Our customers can understand how we prioritise effort
· Our customers can hold us to account
· Our customers are engaged and invested in the process

How do you start?
· Have a process to understand the quality of your customers data
· Help your customer understand how to increase the effectiveness with ATT&CK
· Help your analyst's understand the value that you are delivering
· Develop a process to engage your customer on what is important to THEM!

The future
· No longer a 'Black Box' · Demonstrable value · Build confidence and trust
