Background
­Mobile networks are Critical National Infrastructure ­National interests to secure mobile networks ­Existing security frameworks address functional
requirements, product testing, and deployment guidelines ­Need for a framework that documents post-compromise adversary behavior

What would it be used for?
­Adversary profiling and emulation ­Red teaming ­Assessment of implemented defenses and detection ­Assessment of SOC maturity ­Development of tools ­Cyber threat intelligence

Why not just use ATT&CK as-is?
­ATT&CK is a great tool initially focused on enterprise (Windows, Linux, Mac)
­Now with matrices for mobile devices, cloud and ICS
­But...none are a great fit for modelling attacks against telecom networks
­Telecom networks are complex, comprised of multiple domains each built on diverse principles

To fully capture the whole telecom environment one would need to use several matrices - adversaries pivot between environments

User Plane

Control Plane

It's more than connecting A to B

­Standardized functional architecture with welldefined interfaces and protocols for multi-vendor interoperability
­But product implementations vary
­Operated through different management systems
­Requires multi-domain orchestration
­Realized in various deployment environments: cloud, enterprise IT, telecom, mobile devices, IoT

Use Case: Rogue Base Stations
­ Rogue base stations impersonates a legitimate cell, luring subscribers to connect to it.
­The objective of an attacker could be to: ­Collect subscriber identities. ­Track subscriber location. ­Eavesdrop calls, SMS and data. ­Collect radio configuration.

To be discussed
­Is telecom too limiting?
­How about techniques targeting transport networks? ­MAC-spoofing ­IP-spoofing ­DNS-spoofing ­Rogue DHCP server ­ARP-spoofing ­802.1Q attacks ­Etc.
