ATT&CK IN THREAT MODELING AND USE CASE GENERATION
Ion Santotomas

I HAD NO IDEA AND TOO MANY QUESTIONS
so I went to the internet

CVSS

This is too hard... Isn't there a better way?

USING ATT&CK FOR THREAT MODELING

What else can I use to add depth and defense for these techniques?

line parameters

Deny
User Account Management: Limit privileges of user accounts and groups

Disrupt

PUTTING THINGS IN ORDER
What are the most important techniques to consider?
 Select the top 5 threat actor groups for your industry  Create a Navigator heatmap layer and order by frequently used  Prioritize those techniques

1 2
3

SUPERCHARGING USE CASES
How can I convert the prioritized techniques into structured, actionable use cases?

 Create a matrix and group tactics as categories  Map the kill chain to each technique  Create as much use cases as aspects you want to cover from a technique  Assign scores and follow up improvement
