Problem Statement

Although endpoint is one of the most critical component in organization, it is often not getting the
attention it deserved. Most organizations are often investing their money to either network
infrastructure or network security area first before buying any endpoint security solution.

Objective
This presentation will help security professionals to highlight the importance of endpoint security solution to their management by using MITRE ATT&CK framework to:
 Perform endpoint security (solution) assessment  Track coverage and hunting (results and findings) of endpoint visibility
over the time

When to Apply?
The first use case is to be employed before the organization acquired the endpoint security technology and at the Proof of Concept stage with the vendor. We can use the same baseline used against all the brands and vendors. The second use case is applicable after the organization has their Endpoint Security technology deployed and need to track the coverage of their detection over the time, while also needs to cover the hunt result and findings in centralized space.

Use Case 1
Endpoint Security Assessment

Using MITRE ATT&CK, we can perform a proper Endpoint Security Assessment by simulating threat actor TTPs.
The simulation will be done by using Open Source Tools or Commercial Tools that are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tools evaluation framework.
With this method, the organization will see whether certain technique or tactic is already covered by the endpoint security solutions (both detection or prevention), and spot what detection is not covered by the security products.

For sample evaluation of assessment, we can see the method and the results on MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation page: https://attackevals.mitre.org/

Endpoint Security Assessment Method
 Create a simulation plan based on TTPs that we want to test  Map the TTPs for simulation into a platform  Test the endpoint security products according on the
simulation plan  Analyze the result and identify any gaps from the platform

Endpoint Security Assessment Toolkit

Vectr.io from SecurityRiskAdvisors (https://github.com/SecurityRiskAdvisors/VECTR)

 3 main components; Assessment Group, Campaign, and Test Case.
 Each campaign can contains several test case.

 Create the test case for adversary emulation plans that are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK technique & tactic

 Set the Blue Team Tools (Endpoint Security product which are being assessed)
 Configure the detection layer

 Set the Red Team Tools (BAS Tools which are being used to "test" the Endpoint Security product)

 See the summary and result of the assessment

Use Case 2
Track Coverage and Hunting
The idea is every team member may create the rules and policy to cover as much as possible the MITRE ATT&CK Framework TTPs. And along the way there is some improvement about new technique or new detection rules, every team member may know the details about it.
Based on the knowledge information provided from the platform, every team member can start doing the hunting, and also if they have a new hypothesis or ideas for hunting, they can add the knowledge into the platform, so every other member will know the updates.

Tracking Coverage and Hunting Method
 Oversee the current capabilities of Endpoint Detection Tools and mapped into MITRE ATT&CK
 Create tracking and coverage platform to identified the issue (gaps and testing)  Testing and Validate the detection capabilities based on rules / policy developed at
endpoint side (Does the rules still valid, tune the rules for false positive, or need some improvement)  Oversee the gaps which is not filled yet by the detection capabilities of the endpoint detection tools  Create a platform as knowledge management for newcomers to identified the detection rules / policy for threat hunting

Tracking Coverage and Hunting Toolkit

Attack2Jira from Mauricio Velazco (https://github.com/mvelazc0/attack2jira)
 Manage ATT&CK Techniques as entities
 Tracking Coverage of the Detection Technology Rules and Policy Over the Time
 Allow collaboration within Internal Team to improve visibility from endpoint side
 As a baseline and threat hunting knowledge for each member about the detection rules (so new member will know, which rules or policy applied to detect the Technique from the MITRE ATT&CK Framework)

Summary
 ATT&CK Framework Can be used to evaluate the Endpoint Security before our organization acquired the technology and after the acquisition of the technology for operational process
 Continuous Assessment for Endpoint Visibility is a must and closing the gaps as much as possible from the attacker TTPs
 ATT&CK Framework helps us focusing on specific Technique and Tactic which we want to prioritized for our Endpoint Security visibility
