The story so far (1)
What we wanted:
 Build a telco-specific framework:
 to quickly model a new attack with familiar taxonomy  to compare multiple known attacks similarity in root causes
What we gathered:
 Publications and presentations (from infosec venues)  Threat landscape studies and best practice guidelines
(from standardization and governance bodies)

The story so far (2)
What we did:
 Understand attack flow  Deduce commonalities  Cross-reference with defensive solutions  Tactics X techniques matrix
What we currently have:  47 techniques span across 8 tactics
 Concrete examples of using the framework

User specific data
Network specific identifiers
Network specific data

Impact
Location tracking Call eavesdropping
SMS interception Data interception
Billing frauds DoS - network
DoS- user Identity-based
attacks

Collection  User-specific
 Identifiers: e.g. IMSI, IMEI  Data: e.g. contents of communication
 Network-specific
 Identifiers: e.g. IP, Global Titles  Data: e.g. Topology, routing data
Impact  Location tracking  Call, SMS, Data interception  Billing frauds  Signaling DoS and Radio jamming

SIMJacker
 Large scale espionage campaign on mobile users in multiple countries
 Exploits vulnerable S@T browser in UICC cards
 binary SMS payload through mobile devices, VAS provider, or SS7
 Mainly used for location tracking + IMEI disclosure

What NEXT?
 To build an "Open" community for more collaboration
 As of now, Nokia Bell-Labs, Ericsson, and a few more  To make the current proposal more concrete  To build knowledge base and tools
 Call for participation and contribution:
 ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED  E.g. mobile network operators, equipment vendors, researchers from industry, academia or governance bodies
 Comments, critics, feedbacks are most welcome.
