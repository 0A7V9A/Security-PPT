This talk is not just about writing Sigma rules. ...it's about writing good Sigma rules.

SIGMA RULE PULL REQUESTS
We get a lot of pull requests (PRs) - and we're happy about every one!

SIGMA RULE PULL REQUESTS
We get a lot of pull requests (PRs) - and we're happy about every one!
There's a lot of QA before a PR gets merged: Will there be false negatives? How likely are false positives? Is the detection efficient? But also: spelling, clean form, ...

TWO SHADES OF PULL REQUESTS

TWO SHADES OF PULL REQUESTS
The Sigma open source repository runs CI tests for each PR. This includes:

SHADE 1: CI TESTS PASS

SHADE 1: CI TESTS PASS
Such a PRs meets the test requirements. It's likely that the QA process is finished quickly. It's more likely that the rule is merged quickly.

SHADE 2: CI TESTS FAIL

SHADE 2: CI TESTS FAIL
Some basic checks already fail for this PR. Such a PR likely causes more work. It's more likely that the merge will delay.

SHADE 2: CI TESTS FAIL
Some basic checks already fail for this PR. Such a PR likely causes more work. It's more likely that the merge will delay. Delays cause frustration at both sides: contributors
and maintainers.

STARTING POINT
Lets take a look at CrackMapExec: https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec

STARTING POINT
Lets take a look at CrackMapExec: https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec
This tool contains some very distinctive command lines.

CRACKMAPEXEC: WMI EXECUTION

DEVELOPING A SIGNATURE
The command line looks as follows:
It starts with: cmd.exe /Q /c It contains: 1> \\127.0.0.1\\ Which is followed by: \\Windows\\Temp\\ followed by some random characters. It ends with: 2>&1

LET'S WRITE THE SIGMA RULE!
1. Copy & paste the template 2. Write the rule 3. Test the rule 4. Contribute!

TEST THE RULE
Run Sigma converter (quick) Run CI tests (complete)

CONTRIBUTE OR PUBLISH
To the Sigma main repository: https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma Threat Bounty: https://my.socprime.com/en/tdmdevelopers/ Perhaps offensive tool developers are happy about directly providing signatures for their released tools in their project repositories?

SUMMARY

WRITING A GOOD SIGMA RULE
Use the template! Keep the title short, omit obvious Provide context ad tags, references and descriptions Try to omit regular expressions, they are expensive Minimize usage of wildcards Do testing!
