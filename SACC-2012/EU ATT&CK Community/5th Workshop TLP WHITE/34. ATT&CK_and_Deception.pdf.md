Deception Introduction
"Men are so simple of mind, and so much dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty
who are ready to be deceived." Niccolò Machiavelli

What's Cyber Deception
The goal of cyber deception is to more effectively detect attacks that have infiltrated an organization's network, to confuse and misdirect the attacker, and to understand what assets have been compromised.

What's Cyber Deception
Common Deception Focus Point: - Manipulating the One Thing that Cyber Attackers Count On; - Providing Instant Gratification; - Going Beyond Common Security Implementation; - Simplifying the implementation and the maintenance.

Cyber Deception Issues
Manipulating the One Thing that Cyber Attackers Count On.
­ Relies on the common misconception that the attack is not correctly planned, and the Offensive Cyber Operation relies only on information gathered from the attack itself.
­ Limited application: · Script kiddies; · Hacktivist(??).

Cyber Deception Issues
Providing Instant Gratification.
- Let's focus on the term Gratification: The definition of gratification is satisfaction or pleasure you feel when you get something you wanted or worked for.
- To correctly evaluate the gratification, we need to know the target of a specific Offensive Cyber Operation

Modern Deception Key Points and Attacker Mindset
· Evaluating Offensive Cyber Operation merging OODA, ATT&CK and Targeting we have a clear picture of the key points of a deception system:
­ driving the attacker on a deceive target, according to the real target; ­ cannot be general purpose but should be threat aware; ­ integrated in the production environment, but should represent a
preferential path to reach the deceive target; ­ constantly maintained and updated to match the threat TTPs and the
threat target.

ATT&CK and Deception: Issues and Risks
Deception: ­ is based on the Threat Model; ­ to be effective should be design as Threat-Aware; ­ relies on common Security Mechanism; ­ is an extension of the Attack Surface;
SEC560 | ANeTtwTo&rkCPeKnetarantidonDTeestcineg pantdioEtnhical Hacking 14

Conclusion
· Deception is a key feature in you arsenal as Threat Hunter; · The Enterprise Maturity level should be correctly evaluated,
because you need to:
­ Extend Attack Surface; ­ Integrate in your current Cyber Defense Infrastructure; ­ Understand who is the threat you are facing.
