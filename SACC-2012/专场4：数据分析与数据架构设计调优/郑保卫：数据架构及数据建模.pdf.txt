Quantity

IDC estimates that the world will reach a zettabyte of data (1,000 exabytes or 1 million pedabytes) in 2010
Mearian, Lucas. "A zettabyte by 2010: Corporate data grows fiftyfold in three years." Computerworld, March 6, 2007.

Quality

Process failure and information scrap and rework caused by defective information costs the United States alone $1.5 trillion or more.
Gartner, Inc press release. "'Dirty Data' is a Business Problem, Not an IT Problem, Says Gartner," March 2, 2007.
Best-practice data quality programs are not a one-shot measure (clean up and move on)... To achieve such results, successful programs identify the organizational processes behind data quality. Much like regular IT housekeeping, from virus scanning or performance monitoring to data backup, the data quality program becomes part of daily IT routine.
English, Larry. "Plain English about Information Quality: Information Quality Tipping Point." DM Review, July 2007.

SSAACCCC22001122 Over the next two years, more than 25 percent of critical data in Fortune 1000 companies will continue to be flawed, that is, the information will be inaccurate, incomplete or duplicated...

Governa nce

Data governance (DG) refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in an enterprise. A sound data governance program includes a governing body or council, a defined set of procedures, and a plan to execute those procedures. Many companies have difficulty keeping data consistent, synchronised and in a high quality state, Data needs to be managed in a robust way, so Data governance is needed.
Data governance processes can be automated using data services built using workflow and deployed on a data Management platform
Enterprise data governance requires systematic implementation of common processes via re-usable services on a data management platform.
Mike Ferguson "Accelerating Enterprise Data Governance" Intelligent Business Strategies. December 2007
