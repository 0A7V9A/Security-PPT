Tablets saw enthusiastic adoption by US consumers

Consumerization complicates enterprise information control

We see three levels of mobile access...

Exchange applications (email, contact, calendar)
Many

Select enterprise applications
Some

Everything a PC can access?
Rare

More specifically ....
"Which mobile applications do you use on your smartphone for work?" (Multiple responses accepted)

Sales force application Web conferencing Team collaboration
Social media for work Company-specific application Video viewing (not videoconferencing) My company's Intranet/Portal
Instant messaging (IM) Maps/navigation Calendar Email

Data exposure can happen without explicit notice
Your corporate data is now in the cloud

Consumer devices complicate enterprise control

Co-mingle of email
accounts
Privacy concerns
Legal concerns

Consumer apps may process corporate data and back up to the cloud
No clear separation of personal and business emails
Consumer apps may access private corporate info. Corporate management may compromise user privacy.
Managing personal devices may conflict with privacy regulations

Corporations are struggling to gain information control on consumer devices

How do traditional endpoint security requirements translate to mobile endpoints?

PCs
Anti-malware
Data protection (e.g., endpoint encryption) Data leak prevention
Device compliance Endpoint management
Appropriate Internet browsing Device security (password entry, auto-lock) Application management

Mobile endpoints
Relevant but less urgent More important
Equally as important Equally as important
Usage-driven Policy compliance while on company premise
More important More important

A few mobile-specific requirements

Mobile endpoints
Device wipe Device access control Device seizure for discovery

PCs
Less relevant May or may not be relevant Not relevant for company-owned PCs

Data protection vs. Data leak prevention

Data protection: Prevent unauthorized
access to data

Encryption Authentication

Data leak prevention: Prevent authorized users
from doing stupid or malicious things

App control
Device & media control App-data access control

Is native mobile security good enough?

 Prevents casual attacks, but no deterrent to determined or inside attacks

Device level security (password, lock,
wipe)

Data encryption

 Not available on all platforms and applications.

 No universal control, not fool proof

App store review & code
signing

OS-level segregation

 Doesn't provide the controls you need

Agenda
Consumerization proliferation in the enterprise Information control is a difficult proposition Mobile security and privacy ­ a close look Mobility trends and recommendations

Three schools of thought
· Trust
­ Communicate the policies and trust that your employees will do the right thing
· Trust but verify
­ Communicate the policies ­ Have a monitoring piece to verify that mobile users are
doing the right thing ­ Deal with policy violation out of band
· Oversight
­ You do not necessarily trust your employees do the right thing
­ Technologies are used to enforce the right behavior ­ Companies who have DLP requirements are in this camp

There is a lot of confusion regarding vendor solutions

Security Technologies Commonly Used In Mobile Implementations

No. 1: User experience is paramount
· The native smartphone user experience should be preserved
· Security at the expense of user experience should be avoided

No. 2: Protect against the most prevalent risk, not the corner cases
· Do not demand a security level unachievable on PCs
­ If you are NOT using "walled garden" applications on PCs, why do it on mobile devices?
· Focus on the most prevalent threat
­ Could be device loss ­ Could be the lack of consistent content
management
· Risk-based approach should dictate your resource investment

No. 3: Go native first
· iOS data protection capability
­ PIN-based encryption provides file-level encryption
­ Secure messaging is built in
· Android-3LM provides similar functions
­ Manufacturers are filling some of the gaps
· DLP/NAC/App mgmt/Strong Authentication are lacking

No. 4: Cover your bases, but remember to be clever with personal devices
· You may not be able to directly mandate what a user can or cannot do on his own devices
· Set policies for must-haves (e.g., must have certain security features enabled)
· Recommend best practices (e.g., do not go to questionable sources for apps)
· Regulate access to corporate resources based on policy compliance

No. 5: Think enterprise-wide, not mobile specific
· Mobile device security/management should be part of a larger endpoint management strategy
· Data protection should be an enterprise wide initiative
· Choose a technology that integrates well with other tools within your infrastructure and system
