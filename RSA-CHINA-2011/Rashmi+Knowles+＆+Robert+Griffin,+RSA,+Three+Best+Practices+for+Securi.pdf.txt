Right Information Trusted Infrastructure

Right Identities

The Result ?
A dangerous void of trust has opened up, standing squarely between organizations and
their ability to reap the
cloud's well documented
benefits.

"We are wondering, do we have all risks identified?
,,we are flying blind."
(Global 1,000 CISO)

Control and Visibility over
Information
· Information Challenges
­ Cloud is `information blind' ­ Mobility ­ Geolocation
· Discovering and Controlling Sensitive Information
­ Identify high risk information ­ Automated remediation functions ­ Logical zoning at Hypervisor level
· Cloud storage based on policy

Example of Built-in Data Classification

VMware vSphere 5+ vShield App with Data Security

Content Aware Infrastructure
 Classify files within VMs
 RSA DLP classification technology embedded into VMware vShield App with Data Security
 No agents or 3rd party software
 Includes 80+ expert RSA policies out of the box
 Consistent classification across both physical and virtual environments

Content-aware Clouds

· Atmos metadata update based on DLP policy · Sensitive data never leaves customer sites or is only sent to
trusted external cloud sites · Build content-aware private storage clouds

Secure Multi-tenancy
Trusted Multi-tenancy model is built on the following six foundational elements: · Secure separation · Service assurance · Security and compliance · Availability and data protection · Tenant management and control · Service provider management and control

Control and Visibility over Identity
· Increased potential points of exposure
­ Identities (individuals and machines) ­ Mobile devices ­ Social media platforms
· Verifying users in high-risk transactions
­ Instantaneous risk assessments ­ RSA Adaptive Authentication
· Detecting Fraudulent users inside clouds
­ RSA Transaction Monitoring

Value of Unified Control and Visibility · Conventional Security Management
­ Too slow and rigid ­ Relies on manual process or human intervention ­ Unreliable and unscalable ­ Multiple silo's of implementation
· Automating Security and Compliance
­ Efficiency, control and scalability ­ Ensure services are secured to a common standard ­ Guidance from industry coalitions e.g. CSA
(www.cloudsecurityalliance.org)

Example of Cloud Security and Compliance

Discover VMware infrastructure
Define security policy

Over 100 VMware-specific controls added to Archer library, mapped to regulations/standards

Manage security incidents that affect
compliance
RSA enVision collects, analyzes and feeds security incidents from RSA, VMware and
ecosystem products to inform Archer dashboards (e.g. DLP, vShield etc.)

·Secure federation of enterprise identities to cloud services ·Security and residency of the workloads in the cloud ·Confidentiality, integrity, availability, residency of data ·Visibility, control and compliance of assets in the cloud

The Bottom Line.....
· Cloud offers untold Business opportunity · Don't wait for all the stars to line up.... · Security is a perceived risk and can be overcome · Enterprise hybrid cloud may offer the perfect
balance · Real risk is not an IT risk but a business
risk..............
