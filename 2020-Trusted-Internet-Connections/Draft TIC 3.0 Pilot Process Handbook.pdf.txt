1. Introduction
Trusted Internet Connections (TIC), originally established in 2007, is a federal cybersecurity initiative intended to enhance network and perimeter security across the Federal Government. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the General Services Administration (GSA) oversee the TIC initiative, setting requirements and an execution framework for agencies to implement a baseline perimeter security standard.
The initial versions of TIC consolidated federal networks and standardized perimeter security for the federal enterprise. As outlined in OMB Memorandum M-19-26: Update to the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative1, this modernized version of TIC expands upon the original program to drive security standards and leverage advances in technology as agencies adopt mobile and cloud environments. The goal of TIC 3.0 is to secure federal data, networks, and boundaries while providing visibility into agency traffic, including cloud communications.
2. Purpose of the Pilot Process Handbook
The purpose of this document is to describe the process by which pilots will be conducted by agencies in accordance with OMB Memorandum M-19-26. While federal standards and requirements define what to secure across an entire enterprise, TIC 3.0 focuses on securing different types of environments, including cloud and mobile environments, along with connections between agencies and selected partners. To provide useable guidance in securing the connections, the cloud, and the mobile users, TIC pilots will use real world implementation test cases to identify solutions for securing new types of environments. CISA will update relevant security policies and architectures to enable agencies to focus on both network and data-level security and privacy, while ensuring incident detection and prevention capabilities are modernized to address the latest threats.
A pilot program is a small-scale, short-term experiment that assesses the feasibility and utility of a program in an organization. TIC pilots follow this framework to reveal insights into different methodologies for implementing the TIC security capabilities.

3. Scope and Key Stakeholders
This document outlines the sequence of steps agencies, vendors, and key stakeholders should conduct for a successful TIC pilot: proposal development and submittal, proposal approval, project plan submittal and approval, pilot execution and management, pilot conclusion, and use case development. Some pilots may require additional steps based on the unique circumstances of the piloting agency.
Audience:
· Federal executive civilian agencies · Vendors
Key Stakeholders:
· OMB · CISA · GSA · Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council TIC Subcommittee
4. Expectations and Outcomes
To ensure the success of the TIC program, CISA is seeking agencies to actively participate in pilots. A pilot should test the configuration and security capabilities of a technology in an agency's environment. Each pilot is expected to:
· Address technology that can be used by the broader Federal Government · Identify applicable security capabilities to secure their environments · Explain how the applicable security capabilities requirements are met · Follow a defined and structured timeline · Be carefully considered and planned · Be supported by agency leadership
Upon completion of a pilot, CISA will collect and analyze lessons learned from the sponsoring agency. The outcome can be used to develop new, and augment existing use cases.

5. Pilot Process
The piloting process is a collaborative and iterative process that ensures consistency in the execution of each pilot. Sponsoring agencies are the primary executors of this process, while other key stakeholders, such as OMB, CISA, GSA, and the Federal CISO Council TIC Subcommittee (hereinafter referred to as the "Subcommittee"), will review submissions, provide feedback and offer ongoing support in accordance with OMB Memorandum M-19-26. This process consists of eleven phases as depicted in Figure 1 below.

5.1 Proposal Development and Submittal
The pilot process begins with an agency, or a vendor, developing a proposal that:
· Describes the goals and desired outcomes of the pilot · Identifies proposed technologies, processes, and resources to perform the pilot · Confirms that resources will be prioritized to complete the pilot, including submission of all
required artifacts · Secures participation from the relevant and associated vendors · Demonstrates how this pilot can be used by the broader spectrum of federal agencies
The Subcommittee will periodically open a solicitation window to receive proposals for new pilots. CISA will provide material (i.e. templates or guides) to guide agencies and vendors in developing a proposal to submit to the Subcommittee. Agencies and vendors can both submit a pilot proposal. However, vendors are expected to obtain agency sponsorship prior to submitting their pilot proposals to the Subcommittee.
Figure 2: Agency-Initiated Proposal Phase

Figure 3: Vendor-Initiated Proposal Phase

5.2 Proposal Review and Approval
This phase determines if the proposal will become a pilot. The Subcommittee reviews the proposal with key stakeholders, assessing the relevance of the pilot to the TIC strategic program goals and, if acceptable, approves the pilot.
Figure 4: Proposal Review and Approval Phase

5.2.1 Subcommittee Review The Subcommittee leads a review of the proposal with key stakeholders, including OMB, CISA, and GSA. 5.2.2 Subcommittee Approval The Subcommittee issues a pilot approval letter to the agency once the proposal is approved.

5.3 Project Plan Development and Submittal
Once the pilot is approved, the pilot proceeds to the project plan phase. The agency develops a project plan that includes the pilot's schedule, deliverables and desired outcomes. Project plans details may include general project activities, such as identifying security tools, selecting security requirements, test planning, and pilot closeout. The project plan is then submitted to the Subcommittee for review.

Figure 5: Project Plan Development and Submittal Phase

5.4 Project Plan Review
The Subcommittee reviews the project plan with CISA and GSA for feasibility. CISA will work with the sponsoring agency to make any adjustments, if needed, to the project plan. Upon approval, the project plan moves into the pilot execution and management phase.

5.5 Pilot Execution and Management
The pilot execution and management phase marks the beginning of the pilot. CISA, in coordination with OMB, GSA, and the Subcommittee, will track the agency TIC pilot's execution and management. This phase is cyclical in nature in which the agency executes the pilot while stakeholders observe the execution to ensure the schedule, deliverables and desired outcomes are met.
Figure 7: Pilot Execution and Management Phase

5.5.1 Agency Executes Pilot
The agency executes the pilot and is responsible for providing CISA and the Subcommittee with regular updates on the progress and status of the pilot. CISA and the Subcommittee will provide guidance as needed.
5.5.2 CISA Tracks Execution
CISA, in coordination with OMB and GSA, tracks the agency's execution of the pilot. CISA tracks the pilot's progress and risks to ensure the pilot stays on schedule. CISA also distills lessons learned from the pilots to develop TIC Use Cases.
5.5.3 Agency Updates Subcommittee
The agency that submitted the pilot provides regular updates to the Subcommittee in coordination with CISA. The updates will include the pilot's progress, risks, and opportunities for government-wide collaboration. Updates are typically provided every two weeks, i.e. bi-weekly.
5.6 Pilot Conclusion
Once a pilot has concluded, the agency must submit the following deliverables:
· Pilot report · Lessons learned · Capability mapping
CISA will provide guidance and resources, as needed, for completing the deliverables.

5.7 Use Case Development
TIC Use Cases are high-level conceptual network security documents. The TIC 3.0 Reference Architecture and the TIC 3.0 Security Capabilities Handbook establish the foundation for the use cases and should be used in conjunction with this document and the use case template when developing use cases.
Figure 9: Use Case Development Phase

5.7.1 CISA Reviews the Pilot Results
CISA, in coordination with the pilot agency and GSA, assesses the results of the pilot and determines how outcomes can be used to update TIC Use Case guidance.
5.7.2 CISA Briefs Subcommittee
CISA briefs the Subcommittee on pilot outcomes and suggests updates to TIC Use Cases. The Subcommittee provides feedback to the pilot agency and CISA regarding the pilot outcomes.
5.7.3 CISA Creates Use Case
CISA, in coordination with the agency, creates a use case based on the pilot, any lessons learned of the pilot submitted by the agency, and Subcommittee feedback.
5.8 Use Case Approval
The Subcommittee approves TIC Use Cases which are generated from pilots' lessons learned and may be produced independently of pilots. CISA, in coordination with the pilot agency and GSA, will review pilot-generated use cases, results, lessons learned and other TIC reference architecture documentation. If CISA determines the pilot does not meet the requirements needed to create or update a use case, then CISA will brief the Subcommittee as to why the pilot did not result in a new or updated TIC Use Case. All use case updates will be made to GSA procurement vehicles, as appropriate, within six months of approval of the new use case.

5.9 Acquisitions
GSA will update government-wide procurement vehicles, as appropriate, within six months of the approval of new TIC Use Case requirements and other TIC reference architecture documentation. The GSA process will not be tracked by CISA, the Federal CISO Council, nor the Subcommittee.
Figure 11: Acquisitions

5.10 Continuing Feedback
CISA, in coordination with GSA, will establish a coordinated process for soliciting agency and vendor input on approved TIC Use Cases and other TIC reference architecture documentation. CISA will keep TIC Use Cases and other TIC reference architecture documentation up-to-date as changes are approved and as technology improves. Once the use case is approved by the Subcommittee, the use case proceeds into the continuing feedback phase. This phase allows for the repeated evaluation of published use cases to account for advances in technology and implementation optimization. CISA, in coordination with the Subcommittee, continuously reviews and incorporates vendor and agency comments into TIC Use Cases, as applicable.
Figure 12: Continuing Feedback Phase

5.11 Compliance Process
Within 90 days of the release of each TIC Use Case, CISA, in coordination with the pilot agency and GSA, will develop a compliance process to validate that agencies are implementing the security controls illustrated by the TIC Use Cases. CISA will update this process as necessary to promote continuous improvement.
