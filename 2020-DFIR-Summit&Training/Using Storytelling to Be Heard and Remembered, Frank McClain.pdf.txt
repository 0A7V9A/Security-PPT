Introverts, to your corners!
 Uncomfortable with social situations  Finding evil is easy; humans are difficult  Our "tribe" is the main notable exception  How do we share new findings?

What's in a story?
 The importance of storytelling  Storytelling is found in every culture  20th Century focuses on "science" instead  Scottish historical author Nigel Tranter

HISTORY
SANS DFIR Summit 2017 Take a trip back in time, to bring some stories to light

STORYTELLING TIME
Jessica and Brian Epic slide deck, of course, and a memorable story from Brian.

Storytelling for the win!
 Very technical talk, highly focused on Amazon Alexa from a hardware & data storage aspect
 Just not that applicable for me, personally  But ... Brian told a story ...

Smart bulb of doom prevention

STORYTELLING TIME
Tim Ball is a professor Professional slide deck, doesn't "sound" like a story ... but it was!

Storytelling for the win!
 This talk was very different than the Alexa one  It was not very technical in nature  It was not as animated and "exciting"  But it still told a memorable story!

"... cheating is fairly widespread."
 Tim told a story about a student who - in a forensics class - used work from a different student in a previous semester, and got caught.
 The student failed the class, denied any wrongdoing, and got parents involved to help fight the grade.

What can YOU do?
 Look for ways to use stories  Convey concepts  Increase relatability  Connect with other humans
 Relax, and share your experiences  Research may be incomplete  Interpretations may be incorrect  But experiences cannot be either
