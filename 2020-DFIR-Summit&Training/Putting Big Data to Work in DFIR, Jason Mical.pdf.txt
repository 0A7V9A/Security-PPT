Go Beyond the Constraints of Traditional Security Analytics, Logging, and Monitoring Tools

Purpose-built
Collect 20X the volume of machine data and meet the crushing demand of automation and
algorithms consuming it, no rearchitecting required

Put More Data to Work, Now
Enrich and combine machine data with other datasets to go
beyond isolated views and unlock the compounding value
of your data

Game-Changing Economics
Use more data, unlock new business use cases, all while shrinking operational costs and
infrastructure footprint

Challenges of Pivoting from Investigating to Hunting
What are the top factors contributing to lengthy investigations?

Poor Visibility
78% report lack of visibility into IT security infrastructure

Low Fidelity Alerts
68% report too many alerts to chase

Impact to Respond
67% report information overload

Isolated Threat Data
51% report inability to capture actionable intelligence

Slow Investigations
56% report inability to prioritize threats

LET THE ANALYSTS ANALYZE WHAT MATTERS MOST.
Analysts' time should not be spent curating information from disparate tools and wading through high noise, low signal alerts. Automatic enrichment up-levels analysts' work and allows for increased experimentation and innovative analysis
