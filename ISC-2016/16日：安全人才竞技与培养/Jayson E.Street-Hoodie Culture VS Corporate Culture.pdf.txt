Perceptions

Hiring
Hackers will not always be waiting in your office in a suit with a resume in hand. Emphasize training and growth opportunities not salary. Reach out to potential employees at conferences, social media and via easter eggs on your website.

Maintaining
Hackers do not need to be catered to, they do need to feel like they are understood. Showing recognition for a job well done cost no money but is also priceless! Making allowances for slight deviances from the standard pays off greatly in keeping a happy and productive workforce.

Now let's learn from others
Discussion and Questions???? Or several minutes of uncomfortable silence it's your choice.
