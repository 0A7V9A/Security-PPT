MISSION CENTRIC APPROACH
Industrial safety: directly affect physical safety. Economical: decrease railroad traffic capacity or other quantitative economical characteristics (train delays, local power outage) Reliability and functional safety impact: ICS crashes, out of service, etc.

COMPUTER BASED INTERLOCKING
1 2

FORMAL REQUIREMENTS

CBI: THREAT MODEL
1. Safety (Cyber Physical Threats) · set a less restrictive signal light · operate a switch with a train passing over it · set conflicting routes ...
2. Economics (freight efficiency) · CBI CPU crash · Blocking of control · False indication...
3. Reliability and functional safety · CBI CPU reboot · Network crash...

#SCADASOS
Q: WTF SACADSOS? A: SCADASOS - (un)Secure Open SmartGrids is open initiative to rise awareness on insecurities of SmartGrid, Photovoltaic Power Stations and Wind Farms.
Q: How to participate A: Find Internet-connected PV and Wind power stations and notify vendors/CERTs/community.

#SCADASOS RESULTS
· 60 000+ SmartGrid devices disconnected from the Internet · Several advisors/patches
