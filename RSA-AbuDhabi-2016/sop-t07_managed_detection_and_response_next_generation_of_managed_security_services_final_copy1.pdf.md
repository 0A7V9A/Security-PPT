How to "Know Thy Enemy"

Proper Threat Intelligence Program
Research who the threat actors are that are targeting you What attack methods do they use Focus on Indicators that provide a higher value of reward
TTP Tools Network/Host Artifacts
Collect, store, and add value to the your threat intelligence
Use Intel IOC's as context and not content (Unless verified a nd even then its value is time sensitive) Collaborate with Government agencies (CERTS) Collaborate with Industry Peers

Problem of MSS Reporting
# of Alerts per month
Does this really mean anything and it's a snapshot in time? Linking alerts across larger periods of time against assets and kill chain show value!
Types of Alerts
What does this have to do with anything? What matters is we let you know when your assets are being targeted and how the alerts have a relationship!
Mean time to detect
Does it matter if I detect someone has stolen your data in 15min or 1 hour?....It's gone! What matters is that we let you know your server is at risk and we are seeing an attempt at data exfiltration!

#RSAC
