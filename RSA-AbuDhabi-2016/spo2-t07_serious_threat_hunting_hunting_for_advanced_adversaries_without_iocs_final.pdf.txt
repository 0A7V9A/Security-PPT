Hunting

#RSAC
Introduction
Attacker trends and challenges A new approach ­ Hunt How to hunt Is this really for me (spoiler alert: yes)
3

#RSAC
Today's Reality

76%
of organizations compromised

146 days
average dwell time

$75B
spent on enterprise security

The cycle isn't working: Prevention, detection, triage, response
Prevention is important but will be bypassed Search and signature based detection is way behind Often, breach notification is external Often, additional adversaries are there while a known incident is closed

Today's Reality: Why?
Network AV: McAfee EDR: FireEye IDS/IPS: Cisco
Next-Gen FW: Palo Alto

#RSAC
Advanced Adversaries Evade security tools Know to avoid tripping known IOCs Advanced human-directed attacks Use polymorphic malware & customized attacks Avoiding outlier analysis

#RSAC
What is Adversary Hunting?
Hunting is the proactive, stealthy, and methodical pursuit and eviction of never-before-seen adversaries inside your network
without relying on Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs).
6

#RSAC
Hunting is

Attacker Technique Focus
Signatures are stale Attacks are unique Sophisticated attacks are tailored

Proactive, Stealthy, Methodical
Hunt for the adversary before an alert Hide from the adversary Plan the hunt, focus on the target of the attack (their endgame)
7

Get Ahead of the Onslaught
Move from IR to proactive adversary detection

#RSAC
Hunting is not...

Searching for IOCs:
Advanced attacks are unique to organizations
Hunters discover and pivot on indicators, not start with indicators

Data Gathering
Hunting is not just the ability to collect mass amounts of data
Effective hunting finds the adversary by automating and facilitating expert analysis

Waiting for an Alert
Hunting is IR with a different starting point

8

#RSAC
Hunting Challenges

Lack of Resources
Process People Technology

Drowning in Data
Knowing where to look for the problem Search is not enough Automating analysis at scale

Tipping off the Adversary
Hiding from the adversary Strong anti-tampering to prevent detection gaps

Hunt Approaches

Topic

Current Approach

Detect threat Avoid adversary detection

· IOCs / signatures of past events · External threat intel feeds · Cloud-based analytics
· Separate process easily identified

Data Hunt Remediation

· Wholesale data collection (network-intensive)
· EDR: respond to alerts · Search IOCs
· Kill entire processes

The Hunt
· Behavior-based protections prevent never-before-seen threats
· Data science encapsulated in sensor
· Stealth installation, operations, and communications prevent disruption by adversary
· Answer critical questions · Automated analysis
· Proactive investigations · Automation
· Surgical response: thread-level precision

The Hunt Cycle

SURVEY
Recon of internal network Identification of assets to protect Gather data

ENDGAME HUNT CYCLE

SECURE
Implement mitigation techniques Prevent adversary techniques Gather uncompromised systems

RESPOND
Respond intelligently with surgical actions Act at scale to evict the adversary Report on the hunt
12

DETECT
Analyze collected data for outliers Discover new indicators of compromise Pivot to determine the full extent of breach

#RSAC
Attacker Chokepoints
Chokepoints: Specific low-level system resources which must be accessed, used, or manipulated by the adversary to meet an objective. Some common attacker techniques visible on endpoints
Injecting code into running processes Dumping credentials from memory Impersonating tokens Evading AV products
13

#RSAC
Attacker Chokepoints
Chokepoint monitoring is critical to detect and prevent known and never-before-seen adversaries Benefit ­ you can block in addition to detecting at chokepoints
Stop whole classes of techniques
14

#RSAC
Hunting Benefits
The attack lifecycle:

Catch Advanced, Customized Attacks

Reduce Dwell Time
15

Scaled Detection and Response

#RSAC
Summary
Hunting allows you to find and remediate intrusions earlier Start hunting now ­ best way to find new and tailored attacks Hunt on and across the systems simultaneously with complementary methods Automate, automate, automate
16

#RSAC
Apply
1.Start with free tools 1.Automate analysis 1.Generate detections based on hunt techniques 1.Use machine learning and data science 1.Start small and limited in scope
1.Use stealth tools and techniques
