Musk is pledging that by the end of 2017, he'll produce a Tesla that can drive itself from Los Angeles to New York City, no human needed.
That timeline puts him years ahead of every other big player working on fully autonomous cars.
Ford is aiming for 2021, China's Baidu for 2019. Google and GM haven't given a hard date, but 2021 is a good bet.

IoT and Volatility ­ Modeling with VIX
VIX is a measure of expected volatility calculated as 100 times the square root of the expected variance (var) of a given data driven environment's rate of return. The variance is annualized and VIX expresses volatility/vulnerability in percentage points. The higher the percentage points, the higher likelihood of potential vulnerability/exploitation....
