Statistics --What keeps you up at night?
Cybersecurity and privacy are the leading issues that keep in-house counsel up at night. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that "the likely annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime is more than US 400 billion." One in three in-house counsel surveyed to have experienced a data breach at their company. The Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) set out to generate the most comprehensive report of its kind and surveyed GCs and CLOs from 887 organizations in 30 different countries-- an unprecedented record number of in-house counsel:
50% of GC/CLOs want to increase their roles and responsibilities when it comes to cybersecurity. 57% expect their department roles to increase in the coming year. 56% of GC/CLOs say their company is allocating more money to cybersecurity than one year ago and that their legal department spend has increased as a result of company focus on cybersecurity.

Lessons Learned-- Data Breaches

Preparation

Detection and Analysis

Containment and Remediation

Preparation

 Forensic firm (e.g., pre-engage, interview, revisit, oversight) (see casino case)  No alternative communication method  No data mapping ­ where are "crown jewels" and sensitive information  No retained counsel skilled in relevant computer crime

Detection and Analysis

 72 hour notification once "discovered" (e.g., EU GDPR)
 No prior analysis of "Reasonable Security" (e.g., CA AG)
 Technical pitfalls:
 Lack of understanding of enterprise computer environment  Lack of log files to determine date of breach event  Security controls not targeted to greatest risks  Lack of relevant network and host-based detection capabilities

Post-Incident Activity

Example: Oversight of Forensic/Auditing Firms
Trustwave Lawsuit
In 2013, a casino operator suffered a security breach where malicious hackers penetrated its payment card systems. Trustwave investigated the incident, and informed the breach was contained. A few months later, Ernst & Young, in the course of penetration testing, found suspicious activity associated with malware that Trustwave was supposed to have removed. Casino operator then suffered a second breach.
In January 2016, the casino operator sued Trustwave, alleging that it failed to properly investigate and contain the payment card breach. The complaint alleges that Trustwave misrepresented its ability to perform an adequate investigation, failed to identify the true source of the breach, and falsely assured the casino operator that the breach had been contained.
Conflicts of Interest
Third party has strong interest to ensure reasonable security measures are in place. Best practices include swapping out auditors every few years (duration can vary).

Insider Risk -- Vendor Management
Implement written vendor policies & procedures Conduct due diligence at pre-contractual stage (including risk assessments) Employ principle of limited access (see Target example) Implement technological safeguards (encryption, access controls) Negotiate protective contractual provisions
Attestations of security Audit rights Notice requirements and ownership Limit downstream data transfers Termination procedures Indemnification provisions Insurance requirements
Ensure effective processes for monitoring, reviewing and auditing third-parties and related follow-up Training by firm of third-party vendors Properly terminate contractual relationship

Insider Risk -- Morgan Stanley (June 2016)
A former employee of a Morgan Stanley indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, MSSB, accessed and downloaded customer PII from two firm portals to his personal storage device. The device was then hacked by a third party, which posted portions of the information to three different websites
On June 8, 2016, the SEC found MSSB's policies and procedures were not reasonably designed to meet the objectives of the Safeguards Rule by failing to include, for example:
reasonably designed and operating authorization modules for the Portals that restricted employee access to only the confidential customer data as to which such employees had a legitimate business need auditing and/or testing of the effectiveness of such authorization modules monitoring and analysis of employee access to and use of the Portals
MSSB was fined a $1 million civil money penalty and ordered to cease and desist

Insider Risk -- Special Attention for Employees
Insider threat ­ employees Weak link in organizations Lack of culture of security Conventional practices involving security training not effective
Cutting-edge tactics to engage employees and develop culture of security Need-to-know access Accountability and responsibility Revisit hiring practices Integrate into evaluation and compensation process Monitoring employees to the extent permitted by law Monitoring or auditing authorization modules

M&A Due Diligence
Initial considerations:
Who's your target (e.g., retail, health, financial, defense, etc.)? What type of information/data will you be acquiring (e.g., PII, IP, PHI, etc.)?
Due Diligence (sample questions):
What are the current data security and privacy practices of the target? What technical controls are in place? What is the existing cyber and privacy policy framework, including policies and procedures? How often are they updated? Are they followed? What is the governance structure of the target? Did the company perform risk assessments? Were the gaps addressed? How many breaches has the target experienced in the past? How were they addressed? Were there any public disclosures? Were there investigations or litigation? What are the target's greatest security concerns?

Next Steps
Immediate:
Map your crown jewels Know your legal and technical requirements/standards Perform cyber and data protection diligence on new key contractual third-parties
Medium-Term (3 months):
Develop and solidify relationships with forensic and legal counsel Identify multi-disciplinary incident response team Run a Table Top Scenario Identify third-party contracts up for renewal to determine renegotiations of cyber and data protection provisions/consider renegotiation of key contracts Review compliance framework and identify gaps
18

#RSAC
Next Steps
Longer-Term (6 months):
Follow-up on gap analysis Integrate security culture into routine business activities (evaluations, incentives, etc.) Annual assessment of cyber policies and procedures and training
19

#RSAC
Developing a Framework for Cyber Protection
Companies, including Akin Gump, work with companies to develop / advise on: 1. Tailored Written Policies and Procedures ­ governance, risk identification, access,
surveillance and testing 2. Incident Response Plans ­ alert thresholds, escalation, law enforcement and client
notification, incident investigation and loss allocation 3. Operational Protocols ­ data intake/flow, vendor oversight, employee training, data
protection and disclosures 4. Due Diligence ­ advise on M&A and other cybersecurity due diligence 5. Breach Response ­ identify the nature and scope of the intrusion, work with the IT
team and experts to restore normal system operation, provide required disclosures and notices, and defend regulatory investigations and/or class actions
