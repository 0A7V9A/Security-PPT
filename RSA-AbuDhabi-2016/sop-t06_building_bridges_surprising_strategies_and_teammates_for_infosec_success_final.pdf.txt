Case Study: Gaining Situational Awareness

#RSAC

CISO: "There is a difference between reacting and hunting. If you're reacting, you're done. We knew we had to go hunting, and that meant we had to do things differently."  Teammates:
 Business Owner: Understood adversary
 Operations: Deploy BigFix for Power Management (GREEN!) AND security
 Compliance: Repurposed SIEM and other compliance tools
 CIO: Driven by Productivity
Result: One of the most advanced automated attack identification and classification systems developed at the time

Case Study: Using Customers To Your Advantage

#RSAC

Large Financial CISO: Only getting investment in InfoSec where required by "compliance"
 Teammates:  VP of Sales: Worked with to include customer contractual obligations in scope of compliance  General Counsel: Determine committed customer contractual obligations, measured risk  Audit: Added customer contractual obligations to scope of audit
Result: Significant increase in Information Security investment--driven by Sales

Case Study: "DevOps" Chaotic Good

#RSAC

F100 Insurance "Chaos Monkey": "We spend ZERO on securing anything but mandatory PCI controls & scope; therefore I must infect the org w/ Card Data."
 Teammates:  LOB CTO: WAFaaS can accelerate your PCI 6.6 & TimeToMarket  General Counsel: We must take reasonable steps to keep our secrets secret  CIO: If we fund a Visible Ops program, we'll run more efficiently & be complaint
Result: More sane/balanced security posture, more agility/efficient IT

Case Study: Changing Report Structure

#RSAC

CISO: "Reporting into CIO ignored Data Security and 3rd Party Risk"
 Teammates:  General Counsel: Heavier concern focus Data Classification/Security  Procurement: More stringent 3rd Party Service Provider Security, Ts & Cs

Greater Board Level Visibility & Access to Drive Table Top Exercises

Case Study: Adversary Driven!

#RSAC

Large Scale European Financial Services CISO: "Despite a large scale information security investment, we were still losing"  Teammates:
 Business Owners: Determine likely adversaries--organized crime for financial fraud
 Risk: Determine potential financial losses due to various fraudulent attacks
 Application Development: Shared investment to tie security controls with app-specific security and fraud prevention
Result: Significantly more effective information security program resulting in lower fraud without significant increase in investment
