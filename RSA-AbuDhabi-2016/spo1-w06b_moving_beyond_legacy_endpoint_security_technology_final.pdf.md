The Current Endpoint Cannot Keep Up
Legacy technology is reactive Reactive cannot scale with the amount and speed of today's malware
99% of malware hashes are seen for only 58 seconds or less In 93% of data breaches, compromise occurred in minutes or less 362,000 new crypto-ransomware variants were spotted in 2015 (source: Symantec)

Data breach news has become a part of daily life Yahoo, Cisco, FourSquare, Home Depot, United Airlines, OPM, Anthem Blue Shield, JPMorgan Chase 5,195 known data breaches since 2005
That's only counting US based data breaches

Malware is used in 90% of cyber incidents
Adversaries create huge numbers of malware variants to avoid detection... or they design one just for you
Unique malware is the norm rendering traditional AV totally useless.

The Standard Security Philosophy
Customers expected to invest more time, money, and energy The security results are staying the same
370,000 pieces of malware recorded daily (AV-Test) 5,195 known data breaches since 2005
1.7 data breaches PER day These are all the known and reported attacks
Customers deserve a different approach to security

The Cost of a Breach
Cyber Crime costs jump 19% in 2016 Unmitigated attack is $40,000 per hour for businesses Average annual losses to companies worldwide now exceed $7.7 million Some companies studied lost up to $65 million

"If you can't get to some level of AI or machine learning with the volume of activity that you're trying to understand when you're [defending] networks from activity of concern, if you can't get to scale, you are always behind the power curve" - Adm. Michael Rogers, NSA
